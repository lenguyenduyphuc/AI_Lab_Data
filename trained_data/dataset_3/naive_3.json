    "input": "So I ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder co morbid with generalized anxiety disorder ADHD and insomnia After reading the DXM criteria because of my psychology class and reading some stories of people with BPD I think there s a pretty good chance I actually have it However I m not sure it s even worth getting diagnosed considering the bad reputation it gets for being difficult to treat by medical professionals and the manipulative aspect Also I ve already been prescribed a lot of the medications they use for BPD for my MDD I ve tried at least 8 different antidepressants probably half of those were SSRIs and one was Bupropion so not an SSRI I m currently not on any antidepressants because none of them worked In the past I ve tried multiple antidepressants of different classes at once like Bupropion and Mirtazapine at one point I was on Bupropion Trazodone and Aripiprazole all at once didn t seem to really help a lot but the Aripiprazole gave me akathisia At a later point I was on Fluvoxamine and Seroquel at the same time didn t help so I went off Currently I m taking Modafinil to help with depression and help give me energy during the day Gabapentin for anxiety Adderall for ADHD and Temazepam for insomnia I ve also seen 2 different therapists for CBT and done Psychotherapy none of it helped I ve heard friends talk about therapy helping them so I don t bash on therapy but I believe it s a waste of time and money for me It has just never helped at all tbh At this point would it even be worth talking to my psychiatrist about it What s he gonna do just give me another cocktail of meds like I ve already tried Also I m about to undergo Ketamine treatment I qualify with my current diagnosis but if I were to be re diagnosed with BPD I believe I would no longer be eligible for treatment However there are current clinical trials to see if Ketamine can help BPD and looking at the research and what ketamine does it sounds like it could be the best medicine for BPD Do I just go on with the Ketamine treatment and hope it helps with whatever I have Keep my lips closed about my suspicion of BPD so I can still get treatment rather than being diagnosed with BPD and continuing the agonizing process of trying a cocktail of meds for 3 4 months and then waiting until I get to the point of suicidal ideation then saying making an appointment to say this isn t working I need different meds and continuing over and over Trying new meds for years on end hoping that in the sea of drugs there s one special combination that clicks with my brain chemistry to alleviate some of my symptoms Because I ve been trying different meds for 5 years now and I m getting real fucking sick and tired of nothing helping",

    "input": "Trigger warnings for mentions of rape suicide miscarriage drug and alcohol Ive tried to keep it as brief and vague as pos This post is going to be rambly and a bit all over the place so sorry in advance Also sorry for the grammar and spelling errors I Äôm looking for advice and guidance please Hi I was diagnosed with bpd 3 years ago Theres been a lot of trauma in throughout my life and the past year or so I finally started to feel more stable which was ace Until recently i cant pinpoint when things started slipping up again but today theres been a kind of explosion of all my built up emotions and I took it out on someone who didn Äôt deserve it at all I Äôm not trying to justify my actions but i think a bit of background would be useful Growing up i was an awful child i was always angry and i never knew why but used to have physical outburst at my parents It was only towards them and I don Äôt know why it was at them and why i was Äògood Äô around others I never wanted to hurt them but i couldn Äôt stop This lead to me eventually going into foster care as my parents couldn Äôt cope but it also wasn Äôt a healthy environment for my siblings I don Äôt blame them for that decision It still hurt Now looking back i can see how incredibly damaging i was to their mental health but i still cant help but feel hurt A lot of their time was taken up with my outbursts and i never got any quality time with them as a result the rest of their time was spent with my siblings Rationally i know they spent time with me because of my outburst but it annoys me because i didn Äôt get that quality time like my siblings Its frustrating as i know rationally that was okay but the other part of my brain has always told me they don Äôt like you they didn Äôt want you thats why you got sent away they only speak to you cause they feel bad The rational side of my brain is constantly at battle with the other side of my brain and its draining How do you get it to stop In foster care i got in with the wrong crowd drugs alcohol unhealthy relationships ect I was also moved foster placements over 15 times as i was too much for people to handle I had Äòfriends Äô use me and steal from me and then death threats when i called them out on it I was raped by another foster kid who at the time i was in a relationship with Has a miscarriage I had episodes of psychosis from drug abuse I ended up in and out of psych wards too for attempts In one of the hospitals a close friend committed on the ward In one of my foster placements i was neglected and there was an investigation into ss which found multiple failings This isnt for sympathy I have felt so done over by people I blame myself alot like if i could control my anger i would have still been at home and none of that would have happened or if i kept my head down and stayed away from the drugs and alcohol alot could have been avoided ect But i also see the bad in everyone I think everyone is out to get me Or how long before that friend wants to hurt me Or how long before that family member decided to cut me me off I have such a fear of being hurt by people that I struggle to go out alone I go on walks by myself to areas where theres not people but everywhere else i have a carer which is usually my mum I moved county to get away from all the stuff from where i used to live and to be close to my mum for support For a while that was going great But then she started to take a step back because she couldn Äôt commit to helping anymore It annoyed me as i moved the the county she was in aa she said shed support me and it seemed to have all been for nothing I could Äôve moved to a few other county Äôs where other friends and family had offered to support It took me back to the feelings i had when i was a child of being too much and unwanted I kept it to myself for a while but we were arguing more and more over the smallest of things Until today when we had another argument and she said she wasn Äôt going to the concert i brought us tickets for and to ask my dad I was so hurt the kind of hurt where u can feel it in every fibre of your body I went to hers to try and talk and i know I shouldn Äôt of She asked me to leave and thats she didn Äôt want to talk Every rejection felt like another knife pushed into me and twisted I wanted her to know how i felt and i knew shed be annoyed if i didn Äôt leave and thats the closest shed get to hurting like i was She said if i didn Äôt leave we were done As i was sat refusing to leave i was thinking to myself just go home this is going to make things worse why do you want her to hurt Your sick But i couldn Äôt I can Äôt explain why She said if i go we will talk on Friday as i said if i leave theres no point as you wont speak to me anyway She drives me home but then I Äôm thinking she just said that to lake me leave Its like im a shell and im being controlled like a puppet Im refusing to leave the car again Eventually i leave but again i don Äôt know why i left just like i don Äôt know why i refused to leave I remember everything but its like it wasn Äôt me My anger my distrust my feelings of rejection are starting to rule my life again I had this under control for so long but its like a screw has come loose and now everything is back to how it was when i was younger I don Äôt want to be like this So i guess I Äôm asking for help on how to stop all of this again I currently have a referral for the mh team in place but i need something sort term for now",

around two years as well as eating disorders my whole life and anxiety and depression for the last five I F24 broke up with my FP M25 last Monday I didn Äôt realize he was my FP until after I broke it off The truth is that for the past three months since i met him he was the focus of my entire life Everything I did was around him and 100 of my emotions depended on him going from euphoric to extremely depressed in a mater of seconds depending or not in wether i got a text from him or wether or not he wanted to see me There was never a problem when we were physically together but once we were apart my anxiety kicked in and I became super paranoid and jealous and obsessive I never showed any of these traits towards him I would never double text or call him twice or express jealousy etc I would only ask for constant validation for example Äútell me i Äôm pretty do you like me do you like spending time with me etc especially during sex which i knew he thought was weird I never told him anything about my anxiety or my extreme emotions so instead I would just let my life fall apart and cry myself to sleep He wasn Äôt my boyfriend it was a romantic situation initiated by him after meeting him during a weekend getaway with a group of mutual friends He was all in at the start but eventually the situation transitioned into FWB because he couldn Äôt Äúoffer me a relationship Äù i think that was the exact moment I started obsessing I pretended to be fine with it cause I wasn t willing to let go however for me at least it never stopped being romantic It wasn Äôt just about sex we would go on dates and talk every day and hang out to do other stuff We talked about everything and never stopped being exclusive A lot of the things he said and did made me think he wanted more but looking back i was probably overly attached and delusional or just confused He wasn t a bad person He always told me exactly what he wanted on a verbal level i just believe he started to like me too at some point and started doing and saying things not deemed casual which was confusing to me Obviously it ended badly because his emotional unavailability led to him being inconsistent somedays he would be the nicest most into me person treat me amazing and then the next day he would take ten hours to respond a text and bail on me last minute for his friends or family The highs were AMAZING but the lows were unbearable and they were becoming more and more frequent I decided to end it because it was clear to me that i wanted more and he wasn t sure and it was really triggering for my BPD My anxiety and depression were and still are worse than ever i had to increase my dosage of antidepressants and i got back into old ED habits these past months becoming severely underweight I Äôm usually emotionally dependent on my romantic relationships but they tend to be way more short lived and not as deep as this I think it Äôs the first time I develop a romantic FP i m actually not sure i ve ever had an FP though looking back i ve had some very toxic and dependent friendships in the past I went to the psychiatrist last Wednesday and he upped my dose of SRRIs and told me he thinks my BPD is worse than ever Him and my friends and family are really worried about my weight and I am now being constantly observed and pressured towards eating The thought of eating makes me sick and the thought of gaining back the weight i put off scares me to death Everyone thinks that anorexia is the biggest of my problems because it s physically dangerous but no one was worried when I used to binge eat and was a couple of pounds overweight All that worries me is how depressed I am I see no way out of this I broke it off kind of abruptly because i thought it would be better to feel sad for a while than perpetually anxious On the day it happened I acted impulsively and just lashed out on him after sex i didn t want to have sex in the first place and felt no pressure on his behalf just kind of felt this impulse i said some horrible things I told him i didn t want him in my life anyway because he s a drug addict with daddy issues and no ambitions whatsoever in life and then i told him the only reason i ever liked him was because he was fucked up in the head and that was just my type I made it seem like I wasn t interested in anything serious a lie just tired of the way he was treating me but I acted very aggressively and used intimate things he had told me to actually hurt him I was fine the day after i really hated him and never wanted to see him again I obviously then regretted everything i said and this past week i ve been feeling like dying I think about him all the time from the minute i get up to the moment I go to bed I m constantly checking on him on social media and creating fake scenarios in my head that he ll suddenly call me and tell me he misses me and wants to be with me romantically Even if this happened I know that no amount of attention will ever be enough for me not to feel anxious and insecure extremely fearful of anyone walking out on me It s all I think about I can t work I can t sleep I can t lead conversations with others I keep thinking of things I could ve done differently to get him to love me maybe if I hadn t said this or that or acted differently this one time or been skinnier I keep imagining how he hates me based on that last encounter and never wants to see me again What scares me the most is that I felt so much for him and I m scared that he had absolutely no feelings towards me ever and was just using me for his ego This is going to sound horrible but I d rather know that I really hurt him and have him hate me because it s the only way i d know that he cared at some point I know it was stupid to put myself in a situation like this considering my history of mental health I m a really social person and have a LOT of friends and not in the superficial way I actually feel a close connection to a lot of people I know people with BPD don t tend to have long lasting stable relationships and even though for me it s always been true romantically and family wise I make friends really easily and for the most part develop healthy long lasting relationships Lately I ve been receiving so much love All my friends knew about my FP situation most of them met him and saw us together Even though most of them don t know I have BPD just my family it s not because i m embarrassed or anything I just don t want people labeling me and acting differently they know i m extremely emotional and impulsive and know about my underlying mental health disorders They know how hard this break up was on me and are all constantly checking in on me texting me sending me memes and playlists asking me to hang out They listen to me give me feedback my male friends tell me the nicest things to lift my ego not in a creepy way I even feel overwhelmed because knowing about my ED my friends are constantly buying me food because they believe this situation will trigger me already did I know I should feel so loved my family has been the same Super supportive even though we ve been going through rough patches lately Still I can t help but isolate because it seems to me like none of this matters if I don t have FP I feel like no one understands like my friends all think they get it but no one feels heartbreak like people with this mental disorder were you literally feel like your mind is playing tricks on you and you just go through life floating around trying to get over someone I feel like a could trade fifty people who are giving me unconditional love just for the slightest attention from this one person I don t think i ll ever be able to have a relationship with anyone I can t let any relationship develop naturally because I always need more than ANYONE can offer I always bail before I get really hurt but then end up regretting it and more hurt than before I also always tend to go for people who are emotionally unavailable and have never been capable of liking anyone who is actually interested in me I don t know what the point of posting this was i just really needed to write it all down even if no one reads this If anyone does please give me advice on how you ve gotten over past FPs without necessarily finding a new one I d really like to heal by myself and not be emotionally dependent on anyone like this ever again",

    "input": "As the title states above this is the first time I Äôve posted on Reddit about my personal life so here we go Six months ago my girlfriend at the time and I broke up because I had started distancing myself from her the reason why I did this was because of the emotional abuse I received from my girlfriend when she was on BC and depressed Even with her depressive episodes and the effect it had on me and my relationship with family and friends I stuck with her because I loved her and knew that it wasn Äôt her fault And when she got off it eight months ago it also took me some time to adjust Anyways after we broke up we decided to take a break but stay committed to one another because we knew that the thing that could hurt us the most was seeing one of us being with someone else In all honesty things went pretty well after we broke up We started communicating and seeing each other often again We were happier Her and I were both recovering from the depressive states from BC During these times though she didn Äôt want her friends knowing about us continuing to talk because of her friends judgements I know how her sister gets on her often so I understood and was just committed to improving our relationship from the BC fallout we had At the same time though she wanted me to take her out on dates post her and buy her flowers which confused me a bit In all honesty I always wanted to do those things but I was a broke college student on the verge of graduation with an amazing job opportunity lined up Anyways as we get closer to graduation I start asking if we could become official again because I wanted to have her around my family at graduation She even admitted that she didn Äôt understand why were weren Äôt together since we were so much better and happier This was only a day before the event About four months ago a day before my graduation I went through one of the most traumatic experiences of my life One of my partners friends was graduating so they had been celebrating and drinking throughout the weekend Usually I would be invited to go out with her but since it wasn Äôt my celebration and just the girls I understood Plus her friends and sister still didn Äôt know the extent of us still together and talking The only thing I had ask for was her letting me know when she got home safely like we Äôve always done with one another That night I woke up at 3 4am randomly and realized I never got a text so I called and ask if she was okay She sounded different and extremely drunk so I came over to check on her She seemed completely different another person and the drunkest I Äôve seen her in our 3 year relationship I asked what happened and as she taking off her makeup she says ÄúI hung out with another guy Äù My heart dropped I asked her what she meant and she cold heartedly repeated it I then asked if she slept with him to which she replied yes I broke down I couldn Äôt believe it and just asked why To which she responded ÄúHe made me feel wanted Äù She started blaming me saying that this random guy took videos of her posted her and made her feel wanted This messed with me so badly because she told me that she didn Äôt want her friends knowing about us It didn Äôt made sense to me she had also started her period as well and I know how uncomfortable she is about that Out of confusion I called her sister and asked about it to which she responded by bashing me and saying that she could do whatever she wants because she Äôs single Her sister and friend didn Äôt know how her and I were on the verge on getting back together and it took me a second to realize I only traumatized myself more by seeing the bloody condoms in the bathroom and on her bed sheets I felt like I was in a nightmare like I was going mad I really felt my sanity mental state break And as I Äôm broken she drunkenly starts falling asleep and calming down She grabs me tells me to hold her and tell me she loves me That Äôs the girl I fell in love with I laid there awake for the next couple of hours in the bed where it all happened thinking about how it happened with a shattered mind she told me she doesn Äôt remember any of it It never felt like I graduated and I was depressed for the next 2 weeks I stayed in bed almost all day and rarely ate Since then I Äôve been waking up or have panic attacks around 3am experience episodes of amnesia depersonalization derealization and suicidal thoughts I loved her so we tried to work things out and I invited her to move in with me while I work She moved in with me shortly afterwards for the summer and for the most part I was okay with her there with me But as soon as she left to go back to school the symptoms got worse The evening after work I came back to my apartment and realized she wasn Äôt there anymore I immediately broke down and almost went through a 3 day period of derealization The 2nd evening I had downloaded tinder but didn Äôt create a profile The following morning when I was having a panic attack related to that night I had actually created a profile that was the first time I had experienced a depersonalization episode so vividly I didn Äôt remember making it I just remember feeling insecure lonely and sad as I watched myself on the phone for a couple of seconds It felt like a dream and I don Äôt even remember falling back to sleep afterwards I just woke up for work and it wasn Äôt until later in the day I realized I created an active profile when I got a notification that someone liked my profile I was so embarrassed and deleted it right after work since I was busy leading work that day Of course one of her friends found out and told her about it It was only active for a couple of hours and I wasn Äôt active on it so I thought nothing could Äôve happened I explained to her what I had experienced and that I didn Äôt remember making it but she didn Äôt believe me It was the first time I thought to myself that I wasn Äôt mentally right She broke up with me afterwards but we kept talking for the next 2 weeks and I thought she started believing me It wasn Äôt until the day when we had made plans to go out for dinner that she cancelled on me and suddenly told me to stop talking to her This triggered an episode where I tried to OD on my ADHD medicine I don Äôt even remember taking them or how much Thankfully I was okay since it was a lower dosage just stayed up until the next morning At that time I didn Äôt know what I had until I called my best friend after the suicidal episode and told him about my experiences that he said that I should get checked out for BPD as he had it 2 years earlier and he said it sounded similar It makes sense to me since I thought I was going crazy I had never done this before in my entire life I haven Äôt been the same since that night thoughts",

    "input": "No you don t you hated me and used me You listen to my tirade and listen well Justin I don t want you to speak once until my rant is over You know why the call the poor and mentally ill invisible people it s because you re not supposed to see us digging in trash cans and restaurant dumpsters at 3 00 am for our dinner because we spent inside all day Those who lack object permanence make up their own versions of what happens and what people believe or do No one cared about my side of the story so I don t have one anymore I ll save my last for you I do have a bit to say I have had half a year to think and I have things to get off my chest There Äôs no other way I can go about this in good conscience I Äôve wanted to say a lot of things to you since our falling out last year none of which were diplomatic to say the least Expect a few paragraphs It really comes down to letting my bruised ego take over when I found out I was going to be kicked out in July August becoming something that I wasn Äôt and going full Joker mode when I started thinking about what it would be like to spend another year on the street One thing I need to apologize for before the insults is not being my genuine self I didn Äôt want to tell you I wasn Äôt comfortable sharing my twin size bed with you I didn Äôt want to tell you I wasn Äôt attracted to you and our sexual encounters were just that for me it Äôs just cool to have sex with a bisexual person ever since I came out as bi We really don Äôt have enough in common to be compatible and I think you know that we Äôre opposites in a lot of ways I Äôm a metalhead you listen to mostly pop from what I remember I Äôm a light sleeper you sleep heavily I don Äôt like multiplayer games that much and you Äôre too tall for us to have a proper physical intimacy This isn Äôt about that however There are alot of things we both like but there are just as many things we have to agree to disagree upon I looked up to you for your cooking and intelligence and tended to look down on you for the things you were interested in but since you never asked follow up questions about my interests I unfortunately never felt compelled to follow up with you Opposites do not attract all relationships especially friendships are built on a fair amount of common ground and we didn t spend enough time acknowledging the things we both like I have set aside my play through of Legend of Dragoon for that reason cause I know you wanna watch me play it despite me really liking that game so far A lack of communication is the one thing that does cause distance to grow between people and I felt it was just as much on my end as it was yours Most of your banter was just making fun of me and it wasn Äôt as playful as you thought it was You need to work on listening as much as I do if not more and I Äôm not gonna let you gaslight me into thinking I haven Äôt changed for the better in the last couple years I don Äôt get away with blaming memory loss so you shouldn t either Most of my frustration with you and Maddie boils down to being held to ridiculous double standards something I Äôm more than familiar with I Äôm not in denial about my issues I Äôm not a hypocrite I believe you two are in that respect I can detect when I Äôm being judged as if both of you held superiority complexes No one likes being looked down on in the social sense even if you two can t help it in the literal sense Yeah another tall remark for you Unfortunately as time passed my insecurity is what stoked the flames of my porn addiction and why I treated you less than ideally I did feel used when you stopped listening to me just as much as I used you and you were smart enough to detect that I apologize for being so selfish and ungrateful for everything you did for me last year you could have just as easily refused my invitation to reunite I owed a debt to Maddie for getting us back in touch which is why I didn Äôt feel irritated watching her frisky cats that nearly scratched up my PC screen multiple times I m also a cat fag so that might have something to do with it What I meant when I said I lost my identity is I forgot how to take care of myself and part of that is embracing the autism that passionate creative streak I always had that I thought I lost forever in back in early 2020 when the suitcase all of the fiction I had ever wrote as a teenager disappeared from the parking garage and you left the drag during the pandemic so I ruined my mind by getting deep into drugs and awful sex with the 30 year old infant Cray Cray Cristine until she got another war vet junkie to nearly gauge my eye out only to curb stomp my face in instead and fracture my cheekbone Look man The reason I didn Äôt appreciate being called a hypocrite when I harshly criticized Maddie Äôs codependency is because I wasn Äôt seeking that kind of romantic validation in 2021 In the spring of 2021 the reason why I was able to even get on Maddie Äôs good side was because my mental health dramatically improved once I was watching Vtubers and not spending a single penny on them and that Äôs what got me out of my depression and off the meth crack alcohol cigarettes last year As for media escapism I like the content I consume and porn is the only guilty pleasure I have Wish I could finish the 100s of games I play and the comics I own a lot quicker the horny is such a distraction I won Äôt deny I was and am still lonely sexually or otherwise I know what my problems are and I Äôm self aware enough to recognize my flaws and other Äôs That doesn Äôt give me the right to point the finger and obviously my reprimanding of Maddie was in no way constructive and ended up being just as abusive as what she was already going through Of course I had feelings for her I think about everyone Sure I Äôm always horny since I was 12 and yeah my dick gets in the way of my friendships but deep down I just didn Äôt want Maddie to get maimed by her ex cause I do care deeply about people even if I have a weird way of showing it I Äôm ready to move on when you are and thanks for being the best friend I Äôve ever had I completely understand if Maddie doesn Äôt want to talk to me anymore and that Äôs for the best The two things I Äôm most insecure about how I look and my intelligence and when Maddie misgendered me with an emphasized passive aggressive ÄúSIR Äù when she knew I Äôm Non Binary and called me ÄúSO DUMB Äù I was so hurt I had a very public tantrum I guess that was the consequence of me unleashing my frustrations onto her I rolled everything she and you said over in my head until I was miserable It Äôs only very recently that I Äôve been working on projects that I have a different perspective It s clich to say but you haven t changed or moved on You re the same asshole when I m trying to work on myself I wish you were not so close minded still I liked you but you made too many assumptions and thought you knew everything even going as far as incorrectly completing my sentences for me constantly Humbling myself has given me peace The things I said to both you were completely unwarranted especially with Maddie Äôs situation it wasn t my place I only know what She and Ellie have told me about her relationships Maddie Äôs a good person just stressed out Most of us are I just want to spend the rest of my life enjoying the time and friends I have Life Äôs too short to sink into these patterns of behavior I Äôve been diagnosed with BPD and I know the attachment abuse cycle all too well and it s been programmed into me and has an affect on my interactions with everyone I Äôm sick of it Just don Äôt expect my cynicism or sarcasm to go away anytime soon haha That Äôs always been me even as a child Honestly maybe it Äôs best if we all moved on and made new friends but it Äôs up to you I really don Äôt have the patience for you not taking my expectations into consideration and I don Äôt like feeling like I Äôm a doormat for you to step on and I know you feel the same If you value our friendship I Äôll do the same but if you re going to be a bitch about everything you can go fuck yourself",

    "input": "I will try to keep everything as brief as I can and not go into too much detail I been in an LDR with a woman for almost year and the first few months were great with no problems and we were able to see each other in real life multiple times and have good memories with each other We spoke a lot about the future and how we could close the distance to be with each other in person permanently However her personal life is very tumultuous in ways because of external circumstances Around the 4th month of our relationship she became extremely distant and we no longer called each other and hardly talked I try not to bombard people with messages if they don t respond or don t really try to keep conversation up and this foreshadowed what I now suspect is BPD symptoms inside me I felt very anxious every day obsessing over whether she was cheating on me didn t like me anymore was using me etc It would turn into bouts of rage which I could keep inside and not bring up until I couldn t anymore She would occasionally suddenly become active with me again and act like there were never these very long stretches of time without really talking in a meaningful way I m talking weeks while her social media posts were very worrying and came across as flirting with others or being disrespectful to me as well as distancing behavior in other ways telling me she had doubts about our relationship etc that did not line up with the way we interacted at all This would cause me to become very angry with her and unload all of my pent up anger and anxiety on her and start circular arguments Fight make up silence fight repeat I said many hurtful things to her or make accusations without solid evidence but posts that looked bad to me and caused me to fill in the blanks I also would have to block her on all social media delete our chatlogs and ignore her because it was so painful to see her pop up on my feed or phone I would instantly regret this because she would always find a way to contact me this will come into play later We saw each other one final time in real life and there were absolutely no issues Less than a month later she showed me depressed posts from a different account she had about her ex who had broken up with her two years ago They were all made during and after my visits to her and read as if they were just broken up why couldn t he love me among other posts that made me feel like she didn t see me in her future at all This caused multiple blowouts as I was upset and she asked for a break which I obviously knew was really a nice way of dumping me so I accepted it and tried to move on She started heavily flirting and acting very different rebounding but she basically found no one else after me while making depressed posts that were about me for about two months This irritated me but I generally tried to ignore it no contact but she would occasionally contact me and I would get angry again causing an argument until I simply realized it wasn t worth the emotional strain and I would act politely then move on She eventually contacted me regularly and we are more or less back in a relationship which was her idea but its obvious she s hesitant we are exclusive but not official according to her despite the fact shes back to treating me in the same sweet way during the start of the relationship I let this go even though this is contradictory she told me she d rather take things slow to decide if this can really work which I agree with but this also makes me anxious that this is an easy excuse to dump me if she gets bored and wants to abandon me I suspect she has some form of Avoidant attachment based on the obsession with ex distancing and other things The problem is I am still in the cycle of becoming obsessive ruminating and reading too much into things and we have had a few of the same arguments over and over each one preempted by me deciding that I am finally done with her Deleting all messages and blocking except for one or two lines of communication in which she d contact me As I kept researching into what the problem could be I realized a lot of my own behavior was congruent with Borderline I am about to seek therapy for these feelings because it is heavily effecting my mental and emotional health I don t know if this relationship is healthy however I ve never felt the way I ve felt until I ve been with her I ve been anxious and depressed in the face of uncertainty in a relationship or rejection but I can usually bounce back quick and accept the situation I apologize profusely to her but I feel a lot of guilt and shame in the way that I respond to the things that bother me She has worked on communicating with me regularly and sharing whats going on with her life as well as telling me if she needs time for herself and we have been working on establishing boundaries so that I know where I stand easier and she is more aware of what makes me feel devalued and disrespected I don t know how to reconcile my trust issues rumination and wanting to take the nuclear option at the first sign of trouble to save myself prolonged pain I become very obsessive about how she feels about me but also if she s using me only for emotional security and is running around behind my back I feel the distance is a factor because irl interactions are very different I am very afraid this can never work and won t get better but we re both attached to each other No matter how often she reassures me I find a reason to not believe it",

calls her my dad always was buying her WHATEVER she ever wanted giving her everything going in the middle of the night to MCDonalds because she wanted a big mac and a shake expensive clothes jewerly and she always been guilt tripping him 6 months ago she said so someone guy on facebook while drunk that she loves him too also been flirting with perfect english with some guy while she always said that she can t speak english she always been nice to me and we had long converations but she always was extremely sensitive about taking photos of her nobody can take photos of her even if she is completely blurred her whole body pretty close about herself and confirming most of the things that i say and extremely unresponsible reckless and forgetful just like my grandpa that died a few years ago from liver failure from alcohol and drug abuse she was talking about being kind when i talked with her about my inspiration Juice WRLD an extremely talented rapper she always was saying aww how cute how innocent he is like a child poor Juicy why his kindness was always abused he is such an innocent person and that s true and always smiling when i showed a photo of him to her and saying awww what a cutie donating to charity but NOW i can t compherend how she can be such a bad person also she is EXTREMELY lazy she can t even make herself food amp x200B i discovered they are divorcing because when she passed out and ambulance came and whole town saw her drunk and she could t form a sentence only mumbling and 3 5 promilles alcohol was in her blood deadly dose for a regular woman and opioids she says that s meds for her headache i guessed her PIN 7777 and I saw she has 4 accounts one of them has a picture of a young brunette girl looking like a random google image and her conversations about divorce at first she lied about what happened but then my dad told me she is an alcoholic examples of her manipulation and lies dad told me that like a month ago when they were in hotel i was home alone she showed him a rare photo found it on facebook just to show that where he is hugging or not even hugging at all a woman on a photo to prove him he isn t perfect too isn t a saint too and then she told me that after that he started offending her and i asked her how did he offend you what he said about you then she said he was like imitating angry sounds and then she stopped and said okay he didn t offend me he was just yelling at me my dad said he didn t even yell at her she said something about not speaking about something near a child i said to her that i am not a child anymore at all then she said that she meant a biological child and i said that doesn t make sense and she said i am being overanalytical just like my dad and THEN she said that she was really giving me complement that she said that she meant that that s good that i am being analytycal and i pay attention to details when i point out facts she said i am lying and offending her and constantly guilt trips me and my dad and al she does is she makes a victim that everyone hates her etc btw honestly she always seemed kinda sometimes fake and always my dad was doing everything for me she always was lazy but when i was saying that now i think i ts disrespectufl but now i think it s true he was yelling at me that she is not i said to her that my dad said that when the Ukrainian refugees prayed for her together when she was drunk at the hospital she said that they are fanatics zealots and my dad doesn t like fanatics like she didn t even care what happened to her and how they are so kind she just said that they are fanatics she said my dad said that too and i said to her that he didn t and she said that he calls every religious person that believes in God a fanatic and i said that no he didn t and then she said that he said that they are overly religious and culty and i said to her that it was literally a few months ago and about COMPLETELY different people she said that he calls all religious people fanatics when i focus on facts and point out her lies she blames everything on her poor memory when i pount out actual facts and i think logically she says i am overly logical and not everything is black and white but when i said that i feel from her energy that she is manipulating and gaslighting me because she is afraid of losing me she said it s energy bullshit now and i should focus on facts and think more logically when i point out her stressed body language and that she is constantly blinking and that she is gaslighting me and guilt tripping me and my dad she says that oh you are reading too much these stupid psychological books when i focus on facts i am being overly analytycal or offending her when we say she has a problem and we want to help her she is denying it and that we are offending and disrespecting her and that is she doesn t drink every day that doesn t mean she is an alcoholic and that everyone is against her that she is so poor that s because she lost her parents blah blah blah and more and constant guilt tripping and gaslighting I LITERALLY NEVER SAW HER FROM THE SIDE but i want to distance myself as far away i possibly can i feel like she cares about me but she wants to keep me on her side and there were many situations where she lacked empathy or morality she didn t try to correct her behavior when my dad said to her he doesn t feel it anymore she just said okay so divorce and i told her there is fakeness in her eyes then she said that s because she is just tired and that i am overanalyzing I LITERALLY buy NONE of her bullshit NONE i can instantly somehow recognize when i am being lied to and manipulated also when i said about her that she may have a romance she said that you can t have romance online that it s impossible because there is no physical connection it s possible and she knows that and she said but you may have a romance too and then she reminded me when she caught me watching pornographic photo literally EVERYONE my age watches porn",

    "input": "Hello I am writing here because I need some advice regarding toxic parents English is not my first language so excuse grammar mistakes I have always had issues my parents More with my mom than dad Dad kinda excluded me from his family they ve been separated since I was a baby I always hated on dad for excluding me but the further I get to see my mom act hectic the more I come to understanding why he distanced from me Now the problem starts here my mom I have always been living and siding with my mom She often changed her partners In the past she would blame me for being a problematic child and messing up her relationships Then I realized a pattern She keeps attracting those bad guys bad in a sense of actually abusive Her last husband was abusive would try to control what I eat when I eat when I drink he would lock me in my room punch me for not cleaning well enough mentally abuse me and right after we managed to get a restraining order against him she already met a new guy She actually helped him with getting out of prison He was in prison for attacking his wife and driving off with the children I won t really get into that because I know his wife also wasn t the nicest mother Anyway we moved into his really old house that is not at all ready for living We don t have a full kitchen barely working bathroom without a proper water heater My room has plenty of issues with mold it s not properly isolated I don t even have a proper door I have an extra exit through my room and they accidentally put in inside door instead of strong outside door Life with this guy was okay at start he was kind he tried his best to get him to accept me into the family hence my trust issues but then he became more and more careless he would yell all the time throw stuff around the house when he would have tantrums He also didn t finish the house so it would be suitable for living i have 4 other young siblings I ve moved away to a dorm last October so I ve only came to visit the house on the weekends I started to realize how messy the life actually is there They never clean the house was not once mopped or vacuumed in probably 6 months There are missing tiles there is no warm water for cleaning the dishes everything is falling apart My parents often had the opportunity to put more money and work in the house but instead they chose to get a new car get a dog for 2000 Ç that they aren t even properly caring about We ve been living here for 3 years and a half and the house is honestly horrible My mother rarely asks how I am she mostly uses me to babysit kids while she goes to shopping and drives around over the weekends All I hear when I come over for the weekend is yelling on my brothers mom always tells them to clean stuff she never cleans herself and if she is too weak to boss them around or tired she acts like a huge victim My stepdad then steps in like a brave white knight and starts throwing things around like a child having a tantrum Sometimes he even smacks my baby brother hard One of my brothers was really sick 39 degrees celcius fever and he didn t want to eat so my stepdad came to the table and punched the table so hard that his whole plate jumped and everything spilled My brother started histerically crying and he was visibly scared They seriously yell all the time There isn t one thing that they communicate without yelling and insults My parents don t have any friends They always blame people for being problematic They re hating on every neighbour we ever had My mood is very often ruined It got to the point where i said a silly joke in a car and my mom started saying i m not funny then my stepdad yelled at me how dare i make fun out of them and how dumb I am I crack everytime someone yells at me I burst into an anxious crying I want to move out I want to grab my dog and run I seriously don t want to live there anymore It has brought me such misery to go from a man to a man and continue the abuse I am wondering if anyone has any experience of running away from your parents or moving away Do I have any obligations to my parents Can I just grab my belongings tell them I am moving out I m 21 female and I have a best friend that could most likely offer me a place to stay I don t want to feel guilty for leaving my parents but I feel like I m at the last straw of handling their behaviour At this point I feel like I m their slave they put their frustration and anger on Any help is appreciated or advice Thank you",

    "input": "Some triggering topics will be mentioned here so read at your discretion I ve noticed that due to BPD being underdiagnosed in men we get very little recognition Beauase of this disorder being seen as purely emotional it makes a lot of guys feel ashamed Same with illnesses like depression and anxiety I am a 20 year old trans man and I want to share my story of how this horrific illness almost killed me and my recovery Childhood I was a happy kid for the most part I had speech and language delays due to my autism and severe anxiety which I don t remember much of which caused me to become selectively mute partially verbal I overcame this fear of speaking with the help of my amazing mother and those around me and my childhood psychologist I still remember you Lauren I was three at the time At around 5 my Dad had to leave his workplace as I believe the company moved elsewhere His demeaner completely changed and he became very angry Before this I think he still lost his temper often and when my Mum explained that he lost his job I remember saying good which is not normal It shows I had resentment towards him even at an early age He was very strict and put a lot of pressure on me He wanted me to be top of my class at mathematics and would make me sit with him at the computer for long periods of time which I struggled with I believe he tried his hardest but I have some hidden memories of him yelling at me and spanking me I absolutely hate saying this word out loud due to the embarassment It wasn t all bad and it would be unfair if I did not mention the fond memories I had at his computer playing those old browser Scooby Doo games This is the reason I have such a love for video games today Sadly he never saw it as a good thing When I misbehaved he would threaten to smash my Xbox which terrified me It was my favourite thing in the world and it felt like he wanted to take that away He would often compare me to my friend who he feared was smarter despite her being a year younger On a ridiculous occasion he made us BOTH do a maths test when we just wanted to hang out I mean I was 9 Traumatic memories I believe I blocked out some of these or just forgot I never told this to anyone not even my therapist or psychiatrist I might show this post to my therapist next time if I feel comfortable doing so It s the best thing about internet anonymity Due to my autism undiagnosed until I was 6 I had a sensory hair pulling thing I was on his shoulders and pulling his hair kinda like that scene in Ratatouille lol I had no idea it hurt him and I was only around 5 It was not my intention at all He went into a rage and threw me to the ground which caused an empty beer bottle to smash Thankfully the glass never hurt me but I was so confused scared and shocked Since I had angered him and it was not like he did it for the sake of it my Mum was not mad I was blamed and maybe it was my fault who knows Either way it shook me We were on the computer together and I was bobbing my head about which I believe may have angered him either because it hit his face or because I wasn t paying attention Anyway I blocked the memory of the entire event but I remember suddenly being on the ground with him screaming roll over so he could spank me I think Oddly I cannot look at the brand Rollover hotdog UK crappy brand without hearing those words I used to fight a lot with the neighbour kid We were friends but I admit I was a bit of a bully which I am ashamed of I had no concept of boundaries and I do not want to blame my autism ADHD for this but I think I got mad and shoved her and she had to go home crying My Dad was oddly more angry with me than the girl s parents were He didn t speak tome for days and one day threatened to punish me if I ever did it again I was cheeky back not sure why He must have carried to my room but I don t remember that part Next thing I know he enters my room with a belt I was fcking 6 YEARS OLD I must have known what it was for so I pleaded with him not to use it The dog was there too Luckily he didn t It scared the shit out of me I was never beaten or anything but he did hit me on a few other occasions Nothing sore but for stupid stuff like me not wanting to go to the park with him I think he once pushed me into a bush next to stingy nettles He would make frequent comments jokes or angry insults about me being chunky I was NEVER overweight which makes no sense He has hit me a few times but it was usually for me being rude to him Teen years now Mentally I was healthy until I became depressed at 13 I ended up going to CAMHS youth mental health service for kids up to 18 I began to self harm and had a lot of suicidal thoughts I HATED my Dad and I knew deep down it was because of how he used to treat me I never mentioned this to CAMHS because I was so embarrassed I am so embarrassed by spanking I ended up developing some kind of spanking fetish I will never ever mention this to anyone and I believe it was because of the occasions Oddly I know I WAS spanked but I don t remember the actual process or if it hurt or not or left any marks I was a perfect quiet student at school This probably stems from my Dad wanting me to be perfect CAMHS did not know why I had these mood swings The self harm usually happened after arguing with my Dad I would go nuts when he was there I even reached for a knife once I would never have used it but I had these awful dark fantasies every day at school At 14 I was diagnosed with OCD awful illness but unrelated to my BPD or childhood My Mum was heartbroken because me and my Dad used to get on well At 15 things settled for a bit until I reached 16 A younger girl in my school died by suicide It was never mentioned in order to protect us but we all knew I never knew her but for some reason this made me extremely unwell within a day At first I felt numb I didn t want to go to school I was terrified of the tragedy being mentioned and I became extremely anxious every morning incase another death would be mentioned I began to attempt suicide First was a heart hearted wrist cut Then I began trying to hang myself but I was young and it never seemed to work The worst occasion was when I locked myself in the bathroom trying to do it properly My Dad was furious I undid the noose and still refused to leave I was crazy and laughed in his face when he threatened to call the police on me I was 16 and thought that the police only came for crimes He kicked down the door hit me and my nose started bleeding everywhere Tried to run away after fighting with him went to the hospital with my Mum with my nightdress covered in blood could taste the metal in my mouth My Dad took away my games consoles as punishment I told the docs EXACTLY how my nose broke They checked my nose was not broken and discharged me after a crappy pscyh eval Social work was contacted but did nothing To this day I regret not calling the police on my Dad I think I have a slight scar on my nose but its not very visible Following this I had a few other visits like getting stiched up for sh CAMHS had no idea what was causing this and put it down to an unlabeled undiagnosed mood disorder I was put on fluoxotine which did not help one bit I went to university and then dropped out and had the worst mental breakdown of my life 4 hospital admissions in 2021 alone Doc took me off my fluoxotine and gave me nothing else Eventually I was tried on a pathetically low dose of quetiapine Came off it and went all paranoid thinking my house was haunted Took an OD and was in the hospital on a drip for days admitted to psych ward and put on a high dose of setraline for OCD and a small dose or risperidone From Dec 2021 to Nov 2022 I stayed out of hospital I was using other substances like weed edibles and psychedelics I had the worst psychotic experience from the weed but it was an addiction to me Normal people feel calm maybe a bit paranoid For me I heard screaming voices telling me to kms I quit all cold turkey as I was worried about my psychosis getting worse I had an assessment done with a private psych for ADHD and was prescribed concerta It helped a TON Issue is due to my BPD making me more prone to psychosis I ended up hallucinating I quit setraline as my OCD was becoming worse and started escitalopram only SSRI that has ever helped with my symptoms Within days I began talking really fast running around making insane FaceBook comments on a BPD form and accusing people of laughing at me just for reacting with the laugh emoji I was enraged and began to self harm and post with blood I reached out for help months before this as I began craving the urge to put blood all over myself I had homicidal thoughts which terrified me I knew that I would never act on them but I wanted to kill myself as I had the delusion that there was another person controlling me I was admitted to the psych ward and due to past experiences I was terrified I attempted to run away and strange myself but a lovely nurse calmed me down Was the 2 week stay perfect absolutely not But I am now the most stable I have ever been It saved my life I was prescribed a REASONABLE dose of seroquel quetiapine now on around 100mg 125mg may go higher I was paranoid about the nurses secretly wanting me to kill myself and everything they said I analysed as an attack on me The concerta gave me some kind of stimulant psychosis where I felt like I was in two different realities Even being on a lowish moderate dose has taken those hallucinations away The escitalopram lexapro still makes me energetic euphoric jumpy but the quetiapine calms it down a lot For the first time in ages I feel like I want to live I gave up hope My message is to NEVER give up hope If your doctor isn t listening keep trying and trying You deserve to be happy and healthy no med will help BPD is harmful and negative Yes therapy is amazing I used to think that BPD was the worst thing ever because no meds can help I can t engage in therapy because my brain chemicals are screwed up blah blah blah No All bad stories have a happy ending Whilst I blame my Dad for these struggles I have not let it ruin my life I am grateful my attempts on my life failed I hold no resentment to him anymore although I cannot be in the same room as him I just avoid him and do what I love doing amp x200B Peace and love",

    "input": "My therapist allowed email contact in between sessions as his sessions are not always regular due to disruptions in his my schedule I ve emailed him many times in the past and he always replies back within a few days We ve spoken about this in person about the boundaries regarding emailing etc I always start off my emails by telling him that he doesn t have to reply This is something I ve said to him in person as well that I don t need a proper response that all I m really asking when I email is are you still here and a one or two word reply is all I need The past few months have been extremely difficult due to several things that happened all at the same time He knows I ve been struggling I ve also been having exams during this period I m still in the midst of exams The things that have happened messed up my concentration massively and I ve been struggling with trying to study Anyway I didn t have therapy last week and I emailed my therapist as I was having a very difficult time I was basically having suicidal thoughts losing hope and feeling like a failure It was a difficult email to send as I struggle with opening up to people and the email included a lot of painful content It s been 9 days since I sent that email my therapist still has not replied to it I know that maybe it was because I told him he didn t need to reply He knows what I meant by that we have talked about this in person and he always replies to emails regardless But I figured maybe he had other reasons too I ve tried to rationalise it I ve told myself that there could be many reasons why he had not replied He could have been dealing with emergency situations and just didn t have the time He could have forgotten or just not seen it Or something else So I sent him another follow up email 2 days ago to express my distress at his lack of reply and to ask him if there s a reason he didn t reply I told him that all I needed was one short sentence to know that he had received my email He still has not replied Even if he had reasons for not replying to the first email I don t know how to rationalise why he ignored my second email as well All I was asking was one sentence That s all Even if he didn t want to discuss it he could ve told me that we should talk about in the therapy session Unless his email was hacked and he didn t receive the email I honestly cannot understand why he would ignore my second email as well I was very explicit about how distressing a lack of reply had been Being ignored is my biggest trigger there s nothing that causes me to go into meltdown mode faster than that Not only does my mind run wild it makes me feel like I don t exist like I ve been annihilated in some way I have a session with him tomorrow that I have now cancelled as I don t want to see him again He feels deeply punitive to me now I know I m splitting on him but I honestly cannot hold onto any image of him as a good therapist I m so disappointed and betrayed by what he did I only have a few more exams left I really needed to concentrate and my concentration has already been racked by the other things that have been happening but what he did it made me collapse completely I have not been able to focus at all and I m going to mess up my exams I resent him for this I know I shouldn t blame him but if I had known that he was going to be a source of pain I would have never emailed him especially in the midst of exams I think I m also withdrawing from him completely now because I feel like I lost all power all control with him Even if he did have a good reason for not replying I don t ever want to feel so vulnerable and pathetic ever again I don t know if anyone can relate to this but it felt like my life stopped while I was waiting for his email I would look at my phone over and over again willing for the email notification to pop up I didn t want to get out of bed I became even more depressed as the days passed and he didn t reply It was as though I needed a reply so I could breathe again and function again It became almost obsessive I was refreshing my email over and over again I couldn t focus on anything else My mind was going crazy from having panic attacks at the thought that maybe he had died to feeling hated and rejected and ashamed for the contents of the email to feeling resentful that he had robbed me of what little concentration I had left I don t want anyone to matter this way ever again I ve experienced this in my romantic relationships as well and I hated being so dependent on someone else in this manner Whenever I had arguments with boyfriends my world would collapse completely and I wouldn t be able to function at all This is one reason why I have to stop therapy I m just done I can t trust him anymore and I don t ever want anyone to have this sort of power over my life again Do therapists just not understand how it feels for patients clients when we email them I asked him once how he responds if a patient gets triggered and sends multiple emails or something he laughed and nonchalantly said that he just ignores them If he doesn t want to reply to emails he just ignores them His nonchalance bothered me even then Because somehow he didn t seem to understand how hurtful it can be especially if there is no warning",

    "input": "My bf mid 20s is breaking up with me same age He spent a year and a half telling I was his light and everything to him and we built this whole future And he really is the sweetest person I ever met I was diagonsed with bpd when I was around 17 but my psychologist at the time didnt want to tag me with it I had 2 more psychiatrist say the same thing so I for sure have the quiet type my mom has bpd too and Ive seen her break downs and splits and her violence and paranoia I would never lift a finger at another person much less yell much less say mean things It would make me cry and scare ME I just lived in a very chaotic household and learnt first hand what is like to be bpd with all the violence and clinging to what hurts you I have been terrified of relationships ever since I used to run around hiding scissors and knives and pills when I was 8 My mom would hold my face and say promise me to never fall in love She did worse things but I wont mention them I dont get angry I get extremely sad and desperate All in all I am pretty calm but if I feel uncared for Ill instantly sh Ive been doing it since I have memory honestly And cutting is the only coping mechanism I actually have since I was 12 Anxiety depression eating disorder and self harm Nice package Mix in my family always telling me my reality was wrong so I doubt everything and ohhh gosh I realise how hard it is for someone to be with me So I am really honest and cautious and dont expect them to know everything and honestly consoling me is soo easy if you hug me or stroke me Ill instantly start feeling better I started texting this boy long distance We lived together 3 months And now we re back to long distance Everything was so incredible And I told him everything from the start Throughout our relationship we were so in love and he was so thorough about loving me He made some pretty bad mistakes I didnt hold it against him but it did make me incredibly insecure and so I wanted to talk about things so I dont explode He told me this felt like a cycle like he did everything wrong whilst thinking he wasnt That I get sad and get him too sad I told him it WAS a cycle and I was trying to see how to cope with it and I re assured him mentioning all the things he did right I came to him with an insecurity and he didnt help at all He ended up breaking up with me Because he says he feels like a terrible person for what he did it was pretty bad but I thought talking about things from a place of love would help But at the same time saying I am bringing him down and just didnt feel like loving me right now Yet 4 weeks ago he was telling me he loves me and I am the happiest he has ever been and couldnt wait to watch anime and go on walks and do nice things together forever We got back together 2 weeks ago but it feels like we ve been breaking up for 4 weeks and it is killing me My brain is driving me to 10 differeny destinations all day Break up love him ask him to come ask him to go My splits are internal and I try so hard I swear I NEVER get angry I want people to have peace like I want i always tell them they can ask me anything that mistakes get solved or we learn and anything is talkable But apparently I am so sad he feels like he is walking around egg shells which really hurt because it is the opposite I always convey I have been trying to not get paranoid to not let this period in time make me make rash decisions or block him or anything I truly love him But he is killing me right now and gives absolutely no fucks about it I feel like I am so difficult no one will ever care or love me And I dont understand I really am not a bad person I am just sad And people keep hating me for it I dont understand anything I dont trust my reality or my thoughts I dont trust him wanting to break up either but I dont know what to do I dont like monetary love I love the sun and dogs and parks and walks To bring me down from being sad someone could just give me strokies I dont understand how people keep on having such a difficult time loving me I know there is something wrong with me yet I wonder if and what that even is I planned my suicide a long time ago If he breaks up with me I will do it in a year or so so he doesnt think it was because of him which Im not I wont do it because of him And it isnt because I cant live without relationships I knew that as a very obsessive person it was incredibly important for me to have lovely things beside my relationship and not to toot my own horn here but Iam very proud of myself for doing that I watched so many people fall like that into their relationships I am so in love and hurting yes but I am just really tired and really hurt I dont understand anything and I am just exhausted I have always been I have been told I am so fucked up all my life My family and now my boyfriend too I feel it too I dont feel like fighting my brain for the rest of my life I truly dont understand why I cant choose to not be here I know it wont end I am just very ready to go",

    "input": "THIS POST WOULD ALSO FIT UNDER THERAPY RANT TL DR bad coping habit would like some suggestions to stop or manage better and also suggestions to relieve or manage extreme boredom Somethings yes I completely understand why I would get frustrated over losing it I Äôve lost my iPad tonight I use my iPad as a therapeutic drawing tool Im a digital illustrator amp have a couple different apps I use amp have been having lots of ideas pop up in my head recently so I really need to just sketch a quick one I every once in a while However even losing this while I understand a couple of things one being illustrating amp drawing for me is more than just a hobby amp or stress reliever distraction it Äôs a passion of mine one I Äôd like to get better at Which actually turns out I Äôm improving So when I lose this iPad even for a split second amp end up finding it or the opposite losing it for the entire evening not being able find until the next day or even sometimes hours later in the early morning What happens is I quite literally flip out to the point of my head hurting sometimes even my stomach starts to hurt I have been diagnosed and still have IBS so this is never a good thing to stress out to this point If my head hurts from stress then stomach pains will follow after That is currently the state I m in sadly The pains aren t so bad that they re unbearable It s still annoying enough that I m stressed to this point For the rest of the time that I can t find it all I can do until then is watch YouTube vids until my head or any physical pain goes away Once the physical pain starts then I can t do anything The physical pain can reach to extreme cases of carrying the stress in my neck or even the more stranger things having gas pains reaching down to my lower leg I end up having to take my as needed pain medications for this Of course I find that part even more frustrating If any of you have an ongoing hard to fix chronic pain diagnosis or even IBS you know how this is for sure Having these two back to back is bad enough and it makes it even worse when your stressed Now I also have a skin condition ecamza and of course I got this from ALSO being stressed so much So all these physical medical conditions I m diagnosed with is a true pain in the ass almost not metaphorically as you can tell pun unintended lol Back to the coping stuff Yt is one of my more healthier coping mechanisms I ve been doing recently and this is of course good and improvement from the past However one thing that still continues from past coping mechanisms is if my extreme boredom is at an all time high to the point of stress or even no stress and if I don t find anything to do this a bad thing for me We all know or have come to know with BPD anything is always to the extreme and any negative things are always a bad thing and bad to get over of Keeping this in mind I have a habit of picking at my skin I even know this is bad and the dangers it can cause such as infections from small to severe sores and scabs can form depending on how bad the skin is peeled off it can hurt pretty bad and bleed for a few mins which actually has happened to me many a time In the past esp past couple years towards the end of HS this habit really ramped up with the stress of completing hw getting scores to at least past tests standardized testing and such and graduation which was very stressful which is why this habit got to its worse Every day I came into therapy talking about this because I would have band aids and blood sores on my fingers This would get way out of control if my anxiety was through the rough or if I went through MDD BPD episodes Currently what I m doing to stop or manage the boredom isn t working out so well Most of the time it Äôs gotten to the point of where being bored has gotten in the way Even if the boredom is coming from just losing something such as my ipad like this time around it gets me very frustrated I ve learned more to watch YouTube vids but on occasion it gets me into this habit and it almost happened this time It s very frustrating as I m sure you can imagine I ve at least figured out this using an exercise my therapist taught me last summer CHAIN ANALYSIS The frustration of course then leads a chain linking analysis of anxious thoughts gt gt extreme frustration gt gt physical pains if any gt gt then the action is to pick Even if there are no scabs on my skin to pick at Even if there are absolutely no scabs no flaky easy to peel nails I still find something to pick which of course everytime result ends up creating scabs It s great I at least know what the cause is even being aware when it s happening and how it all links up together However as with any habit I have now it seems I have so much difficulty stopping anything especially this one FINAL THOUGHTS If anyone has any other coping mechanisms or ideas of why habits are so hard to stop let me know please I will say this I ve tried the whole meditation thing but I feel like the silence in your head your supposed to have doesn t necessarily work for me my head is an ongoing never ending talking machine haha Of course I ve also tried putting band aids or gloves on but as said above these didn t work either As an FYI currently I m not in therapy I used to be for about 2 years straight but I ve decided I just need a break I m sure that s understandable Commitment is very hard for me right now and has been hard since the beginning of the year and I didn t want to have my therapist end up having to cancel or move other patients around which sadly would sometimes happen to her Of course this isn t her fault at all I completely understand I just need to figure out how to be more committed to that If any of you have any habits that are hard to stop please let me know this as well and please don t hesitate to comment if you ve figured out a way to stop them or at least manage them better also this as well I need all the help ideas or suggestions even validation comments I can get",

    "input": "Sabotaging my own relationships is my crowning glory Splitting is a psychological mechanism which allows the person to tolerate difficult and overwhelming emotions by seeing someone as either good or bad idealized or devalued This makes it easier to manage the emotions that they are feeling which on the surface seem to be contradictory Always right or always wrong Good or evil The gray area doesn Äôt exist It may have never been perceived by myself Recognizing borderline personality disorder You have to have 5 out of 9 symptoms to be diagnosed and I have all 9 Fear of abandonment People with BPD are often terrified of being abandoned or left alone Even something as innocuous as a loved one arriving home late from work or going away for the weekend may trigger intense fear This can prompt frantic efforts to keep the other person close You may beg cling start fights track your loved one Äôs movements or even physically block the person from leaving Unfortunately this behavior tends to have the opposite effect Äîdriving others away Unstable relationships People with BPD tend to have relationships that are intense and short lived You may fall in love quickly believing that each new person is the one who will make you feel whole only to be quickly disappointed Your relationships either seem perfect or horrible without any middle ground Your lovers friends or family members may feel like they have emotional whiplash as a result of your rapid swings from idealization to devaluation anger and hate Unclear or shifting self image When you have BPD your sense of self is typically unstable Sometimes you may feel good about yourself but other times you hate yourself or even view yourself as evil You probably don Äôt have a clear idea of who you are or what you want in life As a result you may frequently change jobs friends lovers religion values goals or even sexual identity Impulsive self destructive behaviors If you have BPD you may engage in harmful sensation seeking behaviors especially when you Äôre upset You may impulsively spend money you can Äôt afford binge eat drive recklessly shoplift engage in risky sex or overdo it with drugs or alcohol These risky behaviors may help you feel better in the moment but they hurt you and those around you over the long term Self harm Suicidal behavior and deliberate self harm is common in people with BPD Suicidal behavior includes thinking about suicide making suicidal gestures or threats or actually carrying out a suicide attempt Self harm encompasses all other attempts to hurt yourself without suicidal intent Common forms of self harm include cutting and burning Extreme emotional swings Unstable emotions and moods are common with BPD One moment you may feel happy and the next despondent Little things that other people brush off can send you into an emotional tailspin These mood swings are intense but they tend to pass fairly quickly unlike the emotional swings of depression or bipolar disorder usually lasting just a few minutes or hours Chronic feelings of emptiness People with BPD often talk about feeling empty as if there Äôs a hole or a void inside them At the extreme you may feel as if you Äôre Äúnothing Äù or Äúnobody Äù This feeling is uncomfortable so you may try to fill the void with things like drugs food or sex But nothing feels truly satisfying Explosive anger If you have BPD you may struggle with intense anger and a short temper You may also have trouble controlling yourself once the fuse is lit Äîyelling throwing things or becoming completely consumed by rage It Äôs important to note that this anger isn Äôt always directed outwards You may spend a lot of time feeling angry at yourself Feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality People with BPD often struggle with paranoia or suspicious thoughts about others Äô motives When under stress you may even lose touch with reality Äîan experience known as dissociation You may feel foggy spaced out or as if you Äôre outside your own body I know that these symptoms aren Äôt all splitting but they all connect together and have splitting involved in them a one point or another You can be scared of abandonment and split when a loved one is leaving You could have a whirlwind courtship and fall in love extremely fast as those with BPD myself included tend to do and if someone isn Äôt going the pace you want them to Well you can split and push them away before they can leave you which ties into abandonment issues When you have an unclear self image sometimes making a mistake can cause a split You didn Äôt buy the right dish soap You Äôre an evil no good idiot Impulsive behaviors often cause splits for me If I don Äôt know the exact outcome of something and then in my made up schedule of how it Äôs supposed to go gets broken that causes me stress and will inevitably cause me to lash out in frustration Also Self harm isn Äôt always cutting or burning yourself Sometimes self harm can be simply punishing yourself for things in a way that seems odd A self harm I do on myself is ask questions I know I don Äôt want the answer to take my showers way too hot and constantly sabotage things I know I shouldn Äôt like friendships relationships and working relationships I am constantly in a swing of intense emotions I Äôll touch on it more at some point but I have quiet BPD Most people would never be able to actually tell the turmoil that goes on inside of me everyday I am in a constant pool of sadness anger frustration irritation and dissociation By the end of my day I Äôm too exhausted to function a lot of the time This matches up with feelings of chronic emptiness and excessive anger Though I am not violent or aggressive thought Äôs have come into my head I have also scared a friend with these thoughts even though I had no intention of actually following through with my thoughts they did not know that and it almost ruined our friendship They felt as though I was a threat that put a lot into perspective for me Being out of touch with reality is a difficult symptom This is the one I struggle with the most I often find myself spacing out and forgetting what I Äôm doing where I am or even what I Äôm saying Stress just makes this worse I have experienced episodes of dissociative amnesia at points of extreme stress Mostly when someone is really yelling at me and my body has almost gone into a third form of fight or flight and has just chosen to float When everything is just too much and so my brain shuts off into auto pilot for a while until my emotions can regulate to a point where I can handle stimulation I love how Mollie touches on how splitting can feel like you Äôre a child again Before therapy that Äôs something I always thought when it happened I Äôd feel like a toddler throwing a tantrum I just couldn Äôt stop or perceive at the moment A friend would cancel lunch Äúwell they just aren Äôt my friend anymore I hate them Äù Someone at my job gives me constructive criticism Äúwell they Äôre just a horrible person and I hate them and I wish they Äôd die Äù These thoughts come and go and I never want to act on them but it is a light switch moment In an instant I want to react in the most dramatic attention seeking harsh way possible I Äôve said before as a joke that I Äôd literally do anything for attention but it Äôs honestly not a joke which makes me very sad if I think about it for too long There Äôs a quote from the podcast in the 3rd episode that really touched me This is really painful for us as people with BPD because all we want in the world is to feel wanted and connected but our own behaviors and tendencies and things like splitting prevent that very that very desire That very feeling to be connected And that is the part of the reason BPD is so painful Mollie Marriott At the end of the episode I felt very tired The realization that someone knew to know that someone knew exactly what I was going through and how I felt was so liberating I can Äôt wait to hear more about BPD from Mollies perspective I feel like we Äôre kindered spirts in a way because I relate to her stories and feelings so much Of course that Äôs a BPD symptom but I do feel like she just Ä gets me",

    "input": "Hey all I m not sure if I have BPD or not my psych had said that he wasn t going to diagnose me since hormones symptoms of BPD that may exist without BPD itself etc can muddle the diagnosis I m 16 male Still I think I exhibit a lot of the symptoms of BPD to a troubling extent and so am making this post to potentially help someone Out of respect though I ll be flairing my post as Person w o BPD As someone who oscillates between absolutely extreme emotions every time a problem occurs or is incapable of seeing the other side of any personal situation I find it hard to manage life I attach myself extremely strongly to people and daydream about a life ahead of course to varying degrees of attachment with different people and plan in detail of the amazing adventures we could undertake A few days later whenever that person slights me I immediately and almost involuntarily not sure if that s the perfect word begin to hate them or self sabotage and thus hate myself Usually an unfortunate combination of the two The thing is I know that people can be morally grey They can be good or bad It seems only logical to me that people can be a jumbled mix of pros and cons While my brain knows my heart does not understand I think clearly in spite of an overwhelming tidal wave of emotions until my brain succumbs and can no longer think I am then guided by my heart towards irrationality and an ever perpetuating vicious cycle of hate and remorse What s more is I feel guiltier because I m afraid of improving I resist taking steps I deem objectively better and moral at the moment than the other because in a way I want to satisfy my selfish desires I absolutely hate this deeply entrenched fear of moving forward that I have It makes me doubt myself I fall into obsessive patterns of self doubt and rumination where I constantly try to reassure myself that I m not bad but I find myself unable to reason with myself and so I end up worse than before Am I really that bad Am I some evil monster who s stuck in an illusion of superficial improvement for the appeasement of his ego all while remaining the same bastard at his core I absolutely hate feeling like this It s hard to manage especially because I end up belittling myself by wondering how it is truly pathetic that I am in this state because of the actions of a single person yes I think I do have a favourite person on whom my emotional state unfortunately rides I think I ve always dealt with intense attachment issues and separation anxiety since I was a child I cried everytime my abusive mother would drop me off at school because though I later grew to hate her I was strongly attached to her I cried when my best friend spoke to someone else more than he did to me I began to notice patterns that only seemed to substantiate my beliefs I still don t trust myself and wonder if these patterns were real or imagined I cried and was driven to a deeper suicidal state when history began to repeat itself consistently unhealthy attachment to someone who had their own issues and was a polar opposite of what I needed followed by heartbreaking loneliness It s been happening almost every cycle Now however the situation is slightly different I m growing to recognize that my FP this time is not as bad as the previous ones I think think think think that I can trust for once I opened up about my unhealthy issues and was met with a mature response not a harsh rebuke So even now when I am in 2 minds over whether I should simply cut her off and go no contact or apologize 1 billion times in hopes of external validation that never seems to fulfill my ever growing need for reassurance I choose to write this post and do neither I m trying to improve I m proud of myself for not avoiding my issues and burying myself in doomscrolling obsessive thinking or productive activities The last one isn t bad lol but I need to prioritize myself And that s what I ve realized it s important to have constant written reminders of the good to tilt the balance slightly away from a wholly evil built up persona in my head I write in a small diary the things that mean a lot to me or things that I believe I need to remind myself of on a daily basis to ensure I don t stray too far out from being rational Apologies for the incredibly long background I will now move onto some of the other tips I have based on my personal experience what I ve extrapolated form certain media what my therapist said I sincerely hope it can help someone out there I apologize if I sound presumptuous I know that BPD is something that quite literally pervades all spheres of your life However if even one person can benefit from what I write I will be grateful And it s okay if that person is me Firstly I think it s important to understand that it is extremely hard and foolish to attempt a complete elimination of all that is bad I know it sounds laughable and obvious but I feel like I hold myself to absolutely unrealistic standards at times I want to get rid of all feelings of jealousy all insecurities And that is a bad ideal to chase Because you end up exhausting yourself and putting yourself at a disadvantage in the hopes of chasing a nigh impossible dream If my problems are currently at a pace where they hit me with their 100 it s unreasonable to expect a landslide victory wherein I kill the problem entirely Just reducing this 100 to a 80 is enough because once it s at 80 I can maybe just maybe tolerate it to a decent extent Holding myself to a standard of 70 60 or 0 just leads to guilt when I can t achieve those targets which worsens everything There s a technique like this in debating too mitigation You mitigate your opponent s arguments and talk about why what they said isn t as good as they make it out to be Or why they re only slightly right The ideal is to call the opponent utter bullshit instantly but that leads to flawed arguments i e flailing efforts from your end and your opponent your various issues jealousy insecurity for me wins by virtue of you effectively sabotaging yourself Secondly Though I usually absolutely hate motivational quotes and the like they often just reek of condescension to me tbh I have found myself understanding a fairly popular one more and more as adversities worsen From Nelson Mandela Courage is not the absence of fear but the ability to triumph over it The brave man is not one who is fearless but one who conquers that fear I first saw this quote in grade 5 I think I dismissed it then but I think I am one step closer to not reading it but understanding it Everytime I hate myself for being afraid of moving ahead and improving I remind myself of the quote If Nelson Mandela an undoubtedly brave man based on what I know said this then why am I holding myself to a standard of perfection Granted he was going through obviously far more than what I can probably comprehend but why can t I apply the same principles to myself And it really helps me when I tell myself that as long as the sum total of my actions tend more towards improvement than regression it s okay Of course I don t understand philosophy or anything along those lines at a high enough level to lay out dynamic and logical principles but it truly truly helps me when I tell myself that it s okay to be afraid and to fear the future to fear uncertainty But running away more often and with more significant consequences than I stand against my fears is something that needs further analysis and improvement Thirdly It helps me to detach especially from my family problems I am academically quite strong but it s creating a burden of overachievement that is suffocating me The other day I got full marks in a test I was quite happy since it s a subject I really struggle with And I was proud because I systematically studied the chapter and enjoyed the entire process for the first time But my mother shot me down rather than congratulating me her instinct was to say that 4 other kids also got full yes the class is incredibly competitive perks of being Indian and that I should be wary She wasn t wrong but it hurt I once came top 10 in the world for a debating competition and a few relatives said I need to do better next time it s epic that I came top 10 but next time I need to aim higher because no one likes a one trick pony When stuff like this happens or I question my passions in life I continuously remind myself that I can always quit It ll be uncomfortable and I ll face a lot of hate from my family if I quit doing what they want But if my willpower is strong enough I don t need to force myself through anything No one s holding a gun to my head and forcing me to continue working like the other kids It doesn t matter if I quit debating tomorrow because no one will die if I do that And once I realize this it becomes a tiny bit easier just 2 3 easier for me to realize that hey maybe I don t want to quit after all I tend to overthink about the future excessively and this really helps me It s not that I m saying we should ignore our problems but it s nice to once in a while pick and choose which ones to ignore Selective ignorance in a way Fourthly Perspective taking metacognition Apologies if this is slightly irrelevant I find that this is something more relevant to my struggles linked with OCD than just anxiety and insecurity Still it might prove helpful First metacognition This is something my psychiatrist told me to practice I found it useless initially because well he was effectively just telling me to think about my thoughts And all I could think was well wtf do you think I ve been doing But as always it took me a bit longer to realize what he was getting at Thinking about my thoughts reasoning with them Reasoning with them is impossible It means being as obtuse and annoying as possible and simply shutting down my thoughts as fast as possible Some negative thoughts pop in Nope Out you go Shoo stop talkingstoptalking ad infinitum It s a game of cat and mouse that happens throughout the day throughout the year and possibly throughout my life It s hard it hurts it hurts a lot It s exhausting But it s worth it because I truly feel proud of myself for overcoming these tiny obstacles Thinking of my own thoughts and analysing a chain of events leading to a breakdown makes it easier to prevent it in the future by minimizing the trigger Second perspective taking My therapist told me to do this whenever I find myself infuriated at a lack of effort from my FP or my friends My 100 is often intense unhealthily so It again leads me to expect unrealistic reactions I will be honest with myself here I found expected unrealistic reactions especially when I was going through a hard time because I wanted someone else to go through the effort of saving me It s hard to admit but it is a bitter pill I need to swallow When I catch myself expecting perfection from someone I try to think from their perspective Hey maybe they re doing their best given the circumstances they re facing And it helps lower my expectations I don t want to get rid of them entirely because obviously that makes it impossible to sift through the sea of red flags in the world today Still just this lil bit helps It also helps me curb unrealistic expectations Remember the other kids I m sure there s absolute monsters out there who can study for 12 hours on end without a break and manage a good life on top of it I truly admire and envy them because they re essentially achieving what I ve wanted But whenever I find myself wishing that I was more like them I try to stop myself It would be arrogant of me to assume that I m good enough to stand shoulder to shoulder to literally the top 0 0001 I ll be borrowing a few ideas from my favourite series Haikyuu here but it s as if these people don t have a single errant thought apart from working for their future and for their dreams They don t care much for approval for adulation for victory they just do what s needed for themselves More importantly from someone s perspective I m sure I come across as one of the other kids And I question myself just how many of these other kids are like me That really cuts down the number of geniuses of hardwork I find myself facing And I m not like them And that s okay I don t need to be top 100 in life to succeed the goal is not to be the best but to be good enough for myself Everytime I remind myself of this I find myself slightly calmer than before Taking the perspective of others is one of the best things I ve ever learnt to try and do I m sure it seems like I m an arrogant and pompous guy who has finally got everything working and now is preaching like a higher moral authority I do apologize since I think I see how it could come across as that but using perspective taking I remind myself and whoever is reading this that I am not 100 okay I still hold unrealistic expectations and end up self harming when the going gets extremely tough or when my FP reacts slightly coldly I don t like those parts of me but I remind myself that I don t self harm daily now I can resist the urge at times And I still fall into obsessive cycles of self doubt Those times are harsh But during moments like these I like being relatively okay I like the knowledge that I ve improved enough to breakdown say 7 times rather than 10 Just like in debating victory is rarely found in demolishing the opponent Instead it s found in eking out a number of marginal minor victories at the points of clash The culmination of these small victories over a period of time makes a massive difference To contradict 14 year old u Feels_Bad_Man19 once again and use 2 quotes Rome was not built in a day and Little drops of water make the ocean Taking things step by step is more powerful than I realized it s hard but it s been worth it I only hope that no matter what difficulties I come across I find myself working towards improvement in some form or the other eventually Continual fresh starts are truly underrated To yet again quote someone from Haikyuu Today you are the defeated What will you be tomorrow",

everything slows and becomes sadder and duller I Äôm a chameleon I Äôve never been real Just a mannequin stuffed full of static I Äôm a disposable posable mouldable mass A joke and a clown with pre programmed sass Watching myself walk down the street I move to the beat like the main character in a movie I Äôm a chameleon Full of yearning and desire For something I continuously burn on the pyre Something I needed so long ago As a weird lonely child only ever told Äúso Äù Who learnt only I could be the fire That would keep myself warm and fed That I was the only person in my entire life Who cared about my pain and suffering and strife It Äôs heavy me leaning on you all the time I know and I Äôm sorry I Äôve been standing on both feet since I was thirteen And fully accepted that other

something to squash extinguish and repress Between the pages of apologies and endless regrets I paint over the walls covered in moss I erect supports for the groaning maggot eaten wood I change the

    "input": "I was friends with someone for 5 years best friends really Near the end of those 5 years she confessed to me that she had romantic feelings for me We were romantically involved extremely briefly after that around a month It was my first romantic experience and I was really overwhelmed and confused I didn t feel fully comfortable with everything that we were doing specifically the physical stuff I was scared of and didn t really know how to say no so I gave in because she kept saying things that indicated she really wanted it Stuff like I just always want sex it s so hard for me to control myself etc I told her I didn t want sex but the next day she initiated sexual stuff I was scared to reject her We had talked about sexual stuff in the past but I just wanted to take things slow It was my first experience at my old age of 25 and I felt embarrassed that I didn t know what I was doing We weren t in a relationship or anything really she just told me she wanted time to work on her OCD before committing to me But stuff was still going on between us and she was still pursuing me Near the end of that involvement she told me she still had feelings for her ex She had called him asking him if he still loved her They had gotten back in contact and I saw that she was always texting him even when physical stuff was happening between us immediately before and after she would be texting him I didn t want to act like some crazy jealous person so I didn t comment on it She also told me someone else was pursuing her for a relationship and another person for an FWB thing She had spent the night before flirting with these two people and being all over them sitting in their lap and stuff right in front of me Again I didn t comment I didn t want to act like some crazy jealous person I also didn t know yet what all was going on between her and all these people She didn t tell me any of this until after a lot of physical stuff happened between us that I didn Äôt feel fully ready for She didn t really put an official end to things She just told me she wanted to go see her ex and that she had feelings for both of us I didn t find out till later that she actually just wanted to get back with him This was the day after she told me she wanted to be with me and chose me I felt so sick when I found out I literally threw up the first time I heard her voice again after she told me her and her bf were back together The whole experience left me very hurt I felt very used cheap ashamed and discarded This was about 9 months ago and I haven t told anyone out loud about this experience except for once to my therapist In the months following that I tried really hard to be compassionate I tried to tell myself well she had BPD it makes romance hard I know because I have it also But the more time went on the more she kept telling me what happened between us didn t mean anything to her She told me she just pursued me because she was jealous that someone else would be my first experience and not her She told me she regretted that we were ever friends and that she only cares about her boyfriend She told me that I was the biggest mistake she ever made It was sad for me because our friendship meant a lot Some other fights happened and she ended our friendship I approached her a while later and asked her why she thought it was okay to take advantage of me for my lack of experience and she told me I just made that up on purpose to target her OCD Even though she told me herself on at least 5 occasions that she only pursued me out of jealousy that someone else would be my first kiss etc and not her Meaning if id had experience before none of this would ve happened My point with this long ramble is how much am I allowed to be angry at her and hurt over this It s been 9 months and I cant move on I feel so gross and dirty over this Like an object there to screw around with and throw out is what it all made me feel I have such a hard time focusing on what I need to which is school and my job right now It feels so silly to be hung up on something that lasted for such a short while I try to have compassion for her mental illness but it s so hard I don t know if her having BPD excuses doing this to me She was my best friend and her lack of honesty and her manipulation and the fact she led me on really was a huge blow to my already non existent self confidence She knew I was very insecure about my lack of experience she would even tease me in the past and say I m an incel She also knew I had a lot of religious anxiety and that going into my first gay romantic experience was hard mentally I just don t know how to move on I don t know what is okay to dismiss when someone has BPD I have BPD also which makes the emotions even more confusing I m lost and hurt and I dont know if I m allowed to be given she is mentally ill I don t know if her mental illness is even what caused this to happen or not but she did use it as an excuse I don t know if that is okay or if I am supposed to just forgive her and act like it was okay to be treated like this by my own former best friend",

    "input": "I love my wife to death and we just had a crazy past couple of days I highly suspect that she has untreated BPD So the other day she got upset at me over something very minor and did what she usually does which is physically leave and block all forms of communication She spent two nights in a hotel and barely talked to me Yesterday I reached out to her by email telling her I loved her cared about her when she was ready she could talk to me and that I wasn t going anywhere She has other mental health issues and is on medication for them After a little bit of arguing about whether I cared about her she unblocked me on messenger and told me to talk We actually talked and were having good conversation about her her emotions feelings etc Then I said something she didn t like and she started seeing me as the evil person I told her that I would talk to her later when was ready and then stopped answering A little while later I sent her a message to just reassure her that I loved her and cared about her Her response was that she was in the ER in extreme pain I rushed right there When I got there she looked awful and I could tell she was scared she reached out for my hand and I held it Her mom and daughter got there and only one person could be in the room so I asked if she wanted one of them to come back She told me no she wanted me to stay until they find out what s wrong I ended up staying with her throughout all of it Even though she was in a lot of pain she was on pain meds she was pretty happy with me we talked laughed discussed future plans etc After a couple hours they find out its her galbladder and it needs removed immediately They didn t do surgery where we were at so they had to find a place we could transfer to They finally found a place and allowed us to drive ourselves there So we drove there and had to go through admission and wait She continued being happy with me and pretty lovey After an hour or so she finally got taken to surgery I got sent to her room where she would be taken after and I waited for her It was about midnight by the time she got back into the room I stayed up until almost 3 with her making sure everything was okay and seeing if she needed anything she finally fell asleep and then I went to sleep So the hospital we were at is known for not being the best and it showed She ended up self discharging because it was a minor surgery we don t have insurance and the doctors still had not come by to look So since she self discharged we had to go back to the original hospital so she could get it checked out and get her meds Since I only slept about 3 hours she told me to stay home and get some rest and she would have her mom take her I took a nap and when I woke up I was messaging her to see how she was doing She seemed irritated at me I asked her if anyone was there with her and she said no I was about to ask if I could come be with her and she said she was getting discharged so I went to pick her up I had previously messaged her and asked her if she was okay other than being in pain she asked what I meant so I asked if she was sad angry etc She responded with yes so I asked are you sadd which she replied yeah So I asked her what was making her feel sad which she responded everything I then told her she could be more specific Her response was just why followed by I m in the ER why would you think that s appropriate right now So at this point i m completely thrown off because I was just trying to ask if she was okay So I dropped it and went and picked her up She got in the car and I could tell she was angry with me I drove to walmart for her meds and before we got out I just simply ask her what was wrong This set her off she freaked out at me got out of the car and ran off into walmart I followed her because she literally just had surgery and was still on drugs from the hospital I was following her asking her to please calm down and relax She just kept telling me it s basically my fault for her being angry and i m just making her worse So she went to the bathroom and I went back to the car to wait Next thing I know the door to the car flies open and she is ripping her suitcase out and running off with it I followed her begging her to calm down and set the suitcase down she just had surgery and I was worried she was going to hurt herself I kept asking her to just sit down outside walmart and try to calm down She just kept calling me the biggest piece of shit that this is all my fault and i m so awful She had called her mom and told her god knows what her mom flew up and I was trying to tell her mom that she had not taken her medication last night and she also needed her meds from walmart but her mom was just acting like I didn t exist then they flew out of there like I was some maniac or something who just threatened them with a gun Her mom lives across the street so when I got home I tried to go tell her mom what really happened and that she didn t take her medication and needed to get her pain meds and antibiotics from walmart Next thing I know shes on the phone wil 911 and then the police arrive I of course had to tell the police what really happened and that she also missed her medication last night They ended up having EMS come which i m glad they did I have never in my life seen her act this erratic over something so small",

    "input": "Disclaimer I writing this for myself in a place where people might be able to provide some perspective or not This is going to be stream of consciousness about me meeting one of the most marvellous persons I Äôve ever met and where we got to so far I don Äôt have bpd she does It does not define her it Äôs part of her and I love all of her We are both imperfect individuals like everyone else maybe more I know she is on reddit but i dont know her username I don Äôt know if she will read this but I dont mind if she does In case she does feel free to judge me be nice to her A couple of months ago I met a girl in a pretty unconventional way We are both over 30 with history and baggage and very good careers We ended up going for drinks one night i did not expect anything to come from it but I really liked the person I met She is gorgeous but that was just a footnote what drawn me to her was her personality her uncommon intelligence and wit her depth and that big loving hearth of hers that she desperately tries to hide from the world That night we ended up having sex it was forgettable what was not forgettable was the special person i had met by a strange chance of destiny I did not expect anything to follow but i was drawn to her and we started chatting lightly as friends Important context those days we were both in pretty bad places with our lives From my side i was in a dead relationship that had been dragging for years A woman I cared about but we grow progressively apart of the last decade and have little left in common besides our past and our pets From her side she had just gone through some pretty awful events in her personal and professional life and to overcome some of those she was putting herself through other painful experiences that were clearly taxing on her mind I am usually pretty withdrawn and have huge shields around me when it comes to sharing what i feel but for some reasons i have never had those with her While we were chatting to each other and getting to know each other we were very open and honest about what was weighting us down This way we slowly got to know each other over about a month Bit by bit leading to bigger things and we were genuinely there for each other I like to think my friendly listening ear helped her through a hard period and I know her presence helped me in a different way For a while it felt she was not really interested in my life and the help went only one way but then it changed Even during that first unilateral phase her presence and friendship were great help for me She told me about her BPD very early on I researched a lot about it spent time reading life experiences here read papers and testimonials I even stumbled into the hate sub and discounted it quite easily that was not and is not her Maybe im naive but the condition does not define her yes the mood swings and rage moments are there and visible but i see the person behind them even when they are at their worst and i know she can get better I tried to be there and hold her hand through some of them and welcome back when they were done trying to make sure she did not feel too bad about the minor things she might have said during those It Äôs not easy but she is worth it Guess what feelings developed on both sides And on both sides we tried really hard not to show them too much But after a while the ÄòI like you Äô turned into what they really were She was the first suggesting a meeting in the future and that gave me the confidence to try suggesting meetings in the short term we ended up meeting for a coffee next to her work It was cute both nervous like silly teenagers after texting for about a month Yes the wonderful person i had got to know texting was real and she was not different in person under the august sun Once you meet in person you kind of open the floodgates and we started meeting more often at least weekly This is were our respective issues made things more difficult She is unfortunately addicted to alcohol She is trying to fight it i see it but obviously it is not easy Alcohol can make her Äòbad splits Äô pretty unpleasant but i am still not judging or changing my views about her Addiction is a struggle and I know she has the strength to get out of it if she really wants to Hopefully it happens before it destroys the brilliant career she has in front of her On my side im not a saint either While my Äòprevious Äô relationship is dead and has been dead for years i still live with her And I do care in a way for that person given the long time we have been living together and our history I dont want to hurt her too much and the process of getting her out to allow me to be next to my new soulmate has been taking longer than it should have After a month there is still no clear date she will be out of the picture My fault i should have the balls to push it But life happens and things slip if i have to travel work hard be with my new friend etc Also not to justify but to provide perspective many times when i had gathered the strength to accelerate the exit process somehow my new potential gf had a bad day and spent a whole night telling me i had no chance with her how her exes were better or that i should leave her alone forever I know the next morning all those silly things were gone but they did leave a bad taste and dampen my decisiveness irrationally We are so different that we complete each other in a way And so similar in other ways no she is not mirroring me she is her own wel defined complex person with a past of toxic relationship and abuse Her past weights on her it is hard including dramatic events that happened just a few weeks ago But her past made her the gorgeous person she is today even if with some scars that still need healing Long story short i had an important 4day long weekend abroad i had been waiting for for months recently and i wanted her to come with me Spend full days and nights together for the first time She could not come pity but not a big deal so i left alone 3 days out of 4 were spent in a drinking bender that ended up into very black feelings towards me One day was very white and loving it also happened to be my birthday incidentally I spent those days talking to her trying to softly bring her back from the dark place she was in I think talking is soothing for her while she is having those bad moments I asked her if it is true she did not say if it is or it isn Äôt So i keep trying to help her the only way i can Now im back in town It is only been a month since we opened up to each other about our feelings but the fact my previous relationship still has my ex living with me still seems to be unbearable to her I was determined to act but I was late Ä she contacted my ex on social media and she was pretty awful to her I should be angry but im not I am disappointed and scared it might be indicative of things to come And i dont want to start something based on the result of an episode and blackmail Ä i want to talk to her while she is calm and positive work things out and see if we can build something important on healthy and stable foundations Unfortunately now is ashamed sad maybe angry with both me and herself I don Äôt know how things will progress I will try to give her all the space she needs hoping she does not decide to forget me while i give her space I know she is capable to do that but again it Äôs a risk i am willing to take Maybe my slow ish progress on my side made us lose the opportunity to have something good Patience is not one of her strong qualities and fast decision making is not one of mine Maybe we will find our own way to happiness together who knows What i know is that she is a special wonderful girl She only needs to find a way to beat alcohol and maybe accept that therapy can help her while at the moment she is utterly convinced it does not work on her Sorry for the long ramblings I love this woman People are imperfect and relationships are difficult BPD is only one of the things that can make them difficult but it is not an insurmountable problem All situation is different but everyone can find a way to be happy Darlingbabe you probably wont read this but if you do and recognise yourself remember one thing I do love you and whatever happens in the future at the very least you have a friend who will always be on your side",

this information together Another thing almost everything I mention might be hard to take seriously and I am pretty embarrassed about that üíÄ My schedule was recently changed My hours this upcoming week have been reduced to 25 hours throughout the entire week I only have four days Each shift is about 5 6 hours and I should be working full time I ve noticed that I have absolutely no days at all where I work with one coworker in particular Me and this coworker tend to clash He however has a history of being problematic so I m not just some problem myself I was told that the reasoning behind my hours being changed was that I m being transitioned into day shifts instead of night shifts because some coworker I do not know wants to do night shifts so they decided to go ahead and put her on night shifts and me at day shifts I have a hard time believing this Anyways about this coworker I clash with He teases people to such an extreme extent and claims that it s just his way of being friendly He will insult you and your interests argue with you be condescending criticize your work and self project onto you If you tell him to stop and assert yourself he will not take you seriously and he will continue He never admits to being wrong As a result with my impulsivity and poor sense of self I developed a personality around him that is extremely hyper immature and is basically his personality but on steroids to cope with how he treats me We are a problematic mix and it s obvious to people but it seems people saw it as fun and games I still don t trust that people will get the wrong idea though especially since I am open about myself because I can never just stfu Him being known to be problematic doesn t stop me from getting paranoid though since he has contacted HR about another coworker who went too far joking around with him This other coworker is toxic as well He is overly blunt and tells people really messed up dark jokes Sometimes they are even directed towards people in a way that is insulting The two of them got into conflict and he went too far so the coworker who often teases others went to HR about it They both got into a bit of trouble I do not see why he wouldn t go to HR about me considering the fact that we tease eachother to death and horse around I also want to mention that there s also a lot of s3x jokes that are spewed out of all of our mouths Sometimes they are directed towards other coworkers and of course you can get in trouble for s3xual harassment this way My stupid impulsive dumbass can t help but to partake in their inappropriate humor Then there is one of the assistant managers Unfortunately I have a stupid crush on him and he s my FP I hate BPD all I do is make a fool out of myself I try to act normal around him but that becomes hard when he too partakes in the teasing and the s3xual jokes with me and the two other coworkers I mentioned What I m mostly concerned about right now is that they all started to target me as the main person to tease and roast and it really hurts especially coming from the assistant manager It s all starting to feel more and more personal especially when he says stuff like you re too short for me if we were a thing people would ask if you re my son and laughing about it He s tall and I m very short and these jokes really sting but I guess I m supposed to just not take them personally since literally him me and the other two coworkers act like a bunch of immature people I really hate it though This isn t me I m LITERALLY just impulsively mirroring them and I don t know how to control myself I want to be myself but I have no idea who tf I am and I have little to no self control and I hate it so much The other day at work I was just casually teasing that one coworker as per usual and I guess I went too far I commented that his breath basically stank and he took offense to that Apparently me saying this was a lot worse than the times he has called me oh I don t know a d ck asshole dumbass serial killer p3do glasses Dahmer stupid degenerate and more along with my work constantly being criticized him insulting my interests and hobbies him trying to find ways to disagree with me on everything laughing at my personal problems and my feelings generally being invalidated As a result he became angsty and sad and started to play his edgy little sappy music through his phone I tried apologizing to deescalate the bullshit and he told me to stop talking for the rest of his shift so I did That was like my last shift with him This upcoming week there is no shift I have with him and it s even to the point where I have no one who can help me We are supposed to have an extra coworker working with us I will be alone on Thursday I remember my first couple weeks working here there was this one coworker who sucked at the job and everyone hated him as a result I d observe how they d treat him They would gossip about him to death when he wasn t around but when he was he was teased A lot He was treated like an equal but it was all fake Nobody liked him He is gone now because he quit So here is my paranoia I am targeted as prey to laugh at for entertainment because I m the mentally unstable homosexual freak who wears all black and has the iconic serial killer glasses so why wouldn t I be a target to bully Everyone hates me They gossip about me tbh this just makes sense since everyone at work gossips so there s no reason I d be excluded from that This coworker is going to go to HR or the higher ups to make complaints about me The assistant manager I like is betraying me and I am being set up for termination I need reassurance that I am being paranoid and irrational or I stg I can t handle this anxiety",

    "input": "Context I had a one sided falling out with a friend group some time ago and it was mostly me distancing myself because whenever with them I would become overwhelmed with a lot of anger and jealousy Tried to rationalize my anger best I could when by myself but ended up feeling lots of guilt and shame I was also just paranoid about them leaving me so I unconsciously tried leaving them first Told them about BPD and some things I go through seemed pretty understanding but nothing changed Haven Äôt spoken to anyone in weeks Some weeks ago my friend 20F confessed she liked me 20F romantically I liked her too Before everything went down we grew close and comfortable with each other And it Äôs the first time someone has openly reciprocated their feelings towards me It seemed like she wanted to start a romantic relationship with me because she told me she Äôd Äúwait for me Äù I told her about how I wanted to work on getting better before going into any relationship or at least learn to manage my friendships before anything else She told me I could tell her to stop waiting if I ever felt overwhelmed After our initial confessions we kept close contact for like a week We lived in the same city but a lot of things happened to her at home so she left for awhile I sent her messages asking her how she was hoping she was doing well when she went days without responding to me So we hadn Äôt been in the same city in a while We made plans prior to meet up and hang out but with everything that happened I understood it Äôd be awhile before we see each other again When she confessed she told me she hoped she could be there for me when times were hard So I tried really hard to be open with her about good and bad things But when we texted it was pretty one sided I Äôd excitedly tell her about something and she Äôd responding repeating what I said essentially She never spoke about herself when I asked about her only giving vague answers It started feeling like she was responding to me out of obligation often times apologizing if her not responding Äúmade me think Äù her words And it did but in the end I always understood she was busy with many things so I didn Äôt feel any anger or thought about it too much but her unwarranted apology did make me a bit irritated because it felt like she really was just responding to me out of obligation And recently after like a month of not seeing her she came back to the city we live in She hasn Äôt told me directly that she came back but we share each other Äôs location It Äôs been a week and I haven Äôt seen her We Äôve texted once this week I had a feeling she had a reason for not telling me like maybe she wanted space after everything that happened at home And I know she has her own priorities But last night I saw that one of our other friends stayed over at her place and this morning I saw that they went out together I know she isn Äôt obligated to tell me anything but still I think it would have been nice for her to at least tell me she was back Last night I texted her she could stop Äúwaiting for me Äù I thought about this for awhile but a part of me wanted to be hopeful but I think seeing them together last night just pushed me over the edge And we haven t revisited this conversation in a long time Ultimately I didn Äôt feel important to her or at least as important as our other friends I couldn Äôt understand why she didn Äôt at least tell me she was back I won Äôt deny I have faults in this I should have communicated my feelings properly but she once told me she liked me because she felt I didn Äôt expect anything from her like everyone else I guess that always stopped me from saying anything because I didn t want her to feel pressured to act a certain way But I always initiated everything Äîplans heartfelt conversations Äîif she had just told me she was back I would have reminded her about our plans to hang out Because of all of this I doubt she has any feelings left for me I don t think I m important to her I don t really know how to go on from here I told her it would be great if we can still be friends but I don t know how to even face her after all of this tldr had falling out with friend group one friend 20F confessed to me 20F I liked them too Talked for awhile her responses became less infrequent due to family issues I understood all of this and was never angry with her or anything We lived in the same city but she left home to deal with family issues She came back recently and didn t tell me but hangs out with other friends despite our prior plans Made me pretty annoyed despite trying to understand So I told her we can stop hoping for anything more than a friendship Now questioning if she even liked me or if I was even important to her",

    "input": "I want to go back to therapy I want to be totally honest After some self reflection and being in denial about my diagnosis I chalked up my symptoms to anxiety and depression as well as the PTSD and was comparing myself to extreme presentations of BPD I want to explain here so as to not trigger or make anyone feel demonized I was once friends with another pwBPD that wasn t in treatment like I was claiming as I have that the meds didn t work they made me feel worse made us zombies etc the general disillusionment when receiving treatment I guess I wasn t getting better but I was trying to be more open but just like them I was bitter and felt like I was just being placated and treated like a child They did some extreme things for example defacing someone else s property when they felt like their FP was taking care of someone else I understand what they felt but it scared me I didn t act out that way but I acted out in other ways no judgment But now after examining myself How I could empathize with the desire to hurt them back I am no longer in denial but I am afraid of myself and have been for years Afraid of what I might do if something hurts me bad enough Does anyone else share this fear And I m afraid to open up to a therapist I realize I ve blamed others for years for my mental health Not my family I m with now but I blamed my mother my foster mother and after a series of limerence issues and feeling like I needed a backup plan after coming out to my husband not wanting to be honest about who I was because I was afraid he d abandon us because I heard him distinctly say things that led me to believe he wouldn t accept me üòî I m not the victim here I ve struggled to keep my irritability in check and not seep how I feel about things into my family I worry that I am a narcissist I retreated from everyone emotionally pushed them away got to where all I wanted to do was smoke pot and stay home and treated everything else like an inconvenience and I m extremely ashamed and feel so guilty about it all And remorse I wish I could go back in time and change it despite knowing I can t change the past I m crumbling underneath the weight of it I try to hold it together and do what I need to do but when I m alone I spend the majority of my time trying to shut up the thoughts in my head I forget to do things sometimes like last night I went out into the kitchen to get my dog his food and my husband asked me to grab him a towel because I had forgotten to replace it after doing laundry I felt so shitty that I had forgotten something so important so quickly I used to be so frustrated that I d snap at others I ve silenced myself and suppressed it all lately and now I m in this place where all I feel is negative When my husband touches me all I can think about is how I have failed to support him in the past I m afraid I can t change That I don t feel love That i have no empathy And I cannot stop it I have tried so hard and it feels like nothing is working When insurance kicks in I m planning to not let myself give up on therapy Starting out fresh with a new therapist everything on the table My triggers the rage when I was a teenager I fought with my foster mom and was extremely defensive and so scared all the time I wouldn t be treated the same as the blood daughters but I got over it over time I am terrified that my therapist will look at me and say I m a hopeless case even though I desperately want to make sure both that I heal and can have decent relationships stop the splitting I m struggling to keep hope alive but I m struggling and say at least I m fighting it I have an amazing support system and worry so much about inflicting the unintentional narcissistic abuse I endured as a result of a narcissistic faith system I even made sure I got confirmation from five other ex cult folks who have had to go through the same process but didn t have as many mental issues as I do for perspective because I know mine is not to be trusted I just hug my teddy bear and try to ride it out but also work in the mornings so as not to neglect my responsibilities I struggle with driving and staying focused and feeling like I m just doing all this stuff for my family out of guilt and ill snap back into my old habits once I get overwhelmed again though i feel overwhelmed at everything I journal I haven t been meditating because it feels like even when I try to focus on that my thoughts still pierce through you re faking this you re not really trying to recover you re just trying not to be alone you re a piece of shit user and that s all you ll ever be and I don t want that to be true but my memories they assault me daily I want to go through my memories with my therapist But I m scared I m terrified I ve told my brother about all this stuff but can t help feeling like he s trying to make me feel better I know he wouldn t lie to me But I feel like I ve made them walk on eggshells around me I dont want that for us my brothers and I got separated and I just got them back a few years ago My worries about everything caused me to be controlling micromanaging I ve tried to be mindful of those triggers and I m working on it But if anyone has some insight some advice anything I ve written these same worries my memories everything down in my journal when I can t get them to stop Can anyone please just anything",

have the faintest idea what it was and honestly don Äôt think I had ever heard the term before Before she told me I already cared about her a lot and we seemed to be like 2 peas in a pod A quick intense attraction and love for each other After she told me she had BPD I knew that no matter what it was I would do as much as I could to support her and stay with her and help her be happy I was an amazing guy understanding patient giving loving supportive but I Äôm not who I think I am Over time she started splitting she would have very intense reactions she would drink a lot which would make her reactions even worse So much yelling we had the cops called to my apartment at least 4 or 5 times and they told us if they get called back again that they Äôll arrest us both for wasting resources She would stay at my apartment and sometimes not say a single word to me and not want me anywhere near her for days and sometimes she would stay at my apartment and we Äôd be connected by some type of skin on skin contact at every moment of the day for days She was so happy and she would tell me how our relationship felt like ÄúChristmas Äù and I felt the exact same way She was so sad and angry and she would tell me how our relationship was the worse one she had ever been in and I would tell her we Äôll get through it I even found a book on loving someone with BPD with good reviews and started reading it to learn more She said I was a manipulator a liar a gaslighter she said I probably had Narcissist Personality Disorder after knowing me for a very short amount of time We would argue about these things and so many more We lost time that could have been so much happier ÄúNot wasted Äù as she would say I was an amazing guy understanding patient giving loving supportive but I Äôm not who I think I am She didn Äôt split just for the hell of it she didn Äôt get angry for nothing she didn Äôt call me a narcissist for no reason she didn Äôt break up with me multiple times on a whim I wasn Äôt an amazing guy I wasn Äôt understanding I wasn Äôt patient I wasn Äôt giving I wasn Äôt loving I wasn Äôt supportive I didn Äôt show empathy I raised my voice I yelled I kicked her out and I called her over I stepped over her boundaries and I wasn Äôt even aware even when I was told I invalidated her I didn Äôt take enough time to try to understand what she was going through I wasn Äôt patient when she had her highs and her lows I wasn Äôt loving when I should have stopped and listened instead of just reacting I wasn Äôt supportive when she loved me and needed me I wasn Äôt supportive when she hated me and needed me I yelled at her when she showed up in my time of need I loved her so much but I didn Äôt have the faintest idea on how to actually love her and I definitely didn Äôt know who I was Every time I made a mistake toxic behavior towards supporting her listening to her loving her I would tell her I am going to change and reflect and do my best I did what I though was the best but I should have done so much more she deserved so much more One day she held up two stuffed lambs one brand new clean no holes The other old and dirty and tattered and ripped up and losing its stuffing She said ÄúIm this one the dirty one the one that Äôs broken and can Äôt be loved and trying to love her would end up with me being hurt Äù I told her ÄúShe Äôs this one the old one the one that has struggled through life the one that fought countless battles alone the one that deserves to be loved the one that is no less deserving of support and love than the other Äù Almost the whole time I knew her she claimed I was a Narcissist overtime her opinion changed to maybe I had BPD I never made a conscious decision to react strongly to her when I was mad I never made a conscious decision to not support her to not listen I never made a conscious decision to yell I never made a conscious decision to not give her space I never made a conscious decision to be so afraid of abandonment or to make such reckless impulsive decisions I did make conscious decisions to stop this behavior from me and only make her happy I tried so hard but my unhealthy behavior was still there I don Äôt believe in God too much but I would I lay awake and pray that he would give me the strength to stop reacting and to just love and be patient and don Äôt get angry and to just listen and understand but I couldn Äôt change because I couldn Äôt even open my eyes enough to see the source of my behavior because I Äôm not who I think I am After knowing her and learning about BPD and going through the traits with her Im almost certain that I have BPD as well Chronic feelings of emptiness Self destructive Impulsive decisions intense unstable relationships with Highs and Lows identity issues abandonment issues problem with anger and extreme emotions recently dissociation anxiety and only very occasionally thoughts of suicide I loved her more than I could really describe and wanted nothing but a very long future and family with her but I didn Äôt know how unhealthy I was I never wanted to cause her sadness or to be sad I think now that she might have been a Favorite Person as we spent practically every day all day together and we loved it We were toxic and we were intoxicating We were in love and we were in hate We couldn Äôt bear be apart even a second and we couldn Äôt bear be together even a second She Äôs gone and I will probably never see her again or hug her again or massage her feet or rub her butt as she liked me to rub it or hear her my name spoken through her beautiful voice or even just get a chance to tell her all these words in person She Äôs gone but she is all around me and I imagine that I Äôm all around her ENDING CONTINUED IN

    "input": "I want to talk about this in the least selfish way I can It s hard because I know it s not her fault and I adore her but if I m not honest about it somewhere i will spiral MAJOR TW talk of SH and su cid3 I will not go into any detail ofc but it will come up One of my best friends of nearly 3 years lives with BPD Recently as in only in the last 2 weeks she disclosed to me that I have become her favourite person I didn t think much of it at first I knew it wasnt something to be taken lightly but I never could have thought it would have had the impact that it has and I don t know how much longer I can cope I will try and explain A day or two after she told me I had become her FP she told me that she was going to buy blades to S H I spent hours trying to convince her not to do it but ultimately i couldnt stop her We spoke after she did and she seemed like she was feeling a bit better by the end of the night so I went to bed because I had work early the next day I woke up to a text she d sent me at 3am telling me she was going to end it all I tried and tried but I couldn t get a hold of her so very long story short I called a crisis line and they sent someone to her house to check she was alright Turns out she was asleep and they woke her up afer which she called me and the first thing she said was what is wrong with you she started laughing saying I was doing too much and I should have known she wasn t going to do it first thing in the morning that I woke her up from her sleep and it wasn t that serious I was distraught I hadn t felt fear like I did when I saw that text in a long time I was on my way to work on the brink of tears thinking I would never see her again We had a fight about it because I was trying to make her understand just how much her response had hurt me I wasnt angry at her for feeling suicidal or even for telling me about it I was upset at how she made me feel like I was exaggerating and had ruined her morning But that in turn made her upset because she felt like she was a bad friend and I was going to leave her She had a complete breakdown that went on for id say about 2 days and I had to just pretend that it didnt affect me and I over it because from the way she was talking she was going to attempt again if I stayed upset with her I actually found the blades she bought the other day when I went to her house she started picking up the box and playing with it so I took it from her and she kept trying to grab me and go in my pockets to get it back saying it was hers and SH was the same as smoking so if I was allowed to have cigarettes she should have a right to harm herself It went on for forever And she knows I m recovering from self harm myself but she doesn t seem to even consider me at all anymore Despite just how upset it made me she s brought it up again in a joking context Joking that her suicidal ideation affected me more than it did her still joking that I was doing too much and I should have known she wasn t that serious But I can t express to her any time shes doing anything that s had a remotely negative impact on me because it sends her into a breakdown Recently I tried to tell her to just give me a warning if she s going to talk about SH which she often will do spontaneously in graphic detail because I myself am in recovery and she got so upset that she stopped talking to me for almost the entire day She constantly asks me if I like my other friends more than her She can t accept that I have other friends that I love as much as her She has said that if i really loved her i would drop everything and everyone around me for her If i talk about other plans with other people if i talk about how much i love other people around me or anything positive that they ve done she makes me tell her that I feel the same about her She makes me say i love her over and over and over again and asks me if I really mean it because she doesn t think I do If i text her the wrong way she makes me change what I said and promise her i didn t mean it the way she interpreted it but the thing it sometimes it will be as simple as a letter in the wrong place or that I didn t capitalise something I talked about how the person I m seeing right now has given me a boost of self confidence and she said do i not make you feel confident am i not doing enough that s another thing She excessively hates the person I m seeing right now We haven t had the perfect start to the relationship and they ve made a couple mistakes but have redeemed themselves in my eyes the mistakes were nothing serious in the slightest But she has literally banned me from talking about him Like I m not exaggerating she won t let bring them up unless it s negative talk or she just ignores me If i even mention their name she gets angry I understand being a bit funny towards them because of some of the mistakes they ve made but the severity at which she despises this person it scares me sometimes And maybe it s worth mentioning I really do not think it s a case of her having feelings for me because she s gay and I m a guy If we re on the phone she won t let me hang up She tells me if i go then I m leaving her and i dont love her even if I have things to do she just tells me to stay on the phone and she ll mute herself If I go to her house she basically doesn t let me leave She ll beg me to stay longer even if I have work the next day or if it s really late and i need to get the last train And I mean she ll be on the verge of tears I m starting to get really scared if i am honest Yesterday she told me she needs to give me something of hers to remember her by and then when i told her that im really worried about her she just told me i dont need to be worried and it s fine My emotions feel like they re being shaken every time I am with her As someone who was a victim of nearly 2 decades of domestic and child abuse i am in no way trying to say that my abuser is comparable to her but sometimes some of the things she says and does scare me in the same way that he did The feeling on edge the not being able to leave the worrying about if I m saying and doing the wrong thing all the time I think she s trying to isolate me from the people around me She keeps telling me about how all the people who are no longer in her life are horrible people and she is never the problem Some of them she says they just felt wrong or felt like they didn t care about her enough This includes ex FPs And I know this is a bit mean to say but i am starting to wonder if that s really the case and if I will become one of those so called horrible people at some point I don t know what to do I miss what our friendship was like before all this If I m honest I am still so so so upset with her about the su cid3 call incident that happened last week amongst some other things but I can t tell her that And on top of that the other day at work we work together she just switched on me for seemingly no reason later she told me it s because she thought she was being a bad friend to me and felt guilty about it and stopped talking to me completely and was actively doing things to make the job harder And then when i tried to tell her how that made me feel she told me she was in the bathroom looking for something poisonous to drink It was just me and her in the store I can t cope with this anymore I feel so so guilty saying it but i feel like there is a weight on me It s barely even been 2 weeks and I feel so heavy Since becoming her FP we ve barely had a normal conversation She just talks to me all the time about how she wants to end it all how she s SHing how she doesn t believe I love her etc etc etc I want to save our friendship but I fear if i even suggest something like we should have some space even if i promise her i will come back and this isn t me ending the friendship either she will never talk to me again or something worse But the way she s made me feel these past 2 weeks I don t even really want to talk to her sometimes Any advice would be more than welcome There are more things that have happened but I feel like I ve given enough detail and this is already much longer than I intended it to me",

    "input": "I don Äôt really know what I mean to accomplish here but I saw some helpful venting posts and figured hey let Äôs give this a shot it Äôs been a while I learned I had several BPD symptoms about 10 years ago and college and ever since it Äôs been a work in progress When I first read about the disorder it was like reading a case study on myself Lots of things made sense in that moment and I Äôve grown to understand BPD quite well I Äôve learned extensively about the disorder read anecdotes for over a decade discussed it with a few therapists mostly receiving derision or dismissive as a response I Äôve meta analyzed my own thinking patterns methods of regulation and behaviors in detail I always faced strife with relationships and identity beforehand but figuring out these were symptoms almost made it easier to approach I Äôve always been a very rational logical person In a way I Äôve come to see this as a coping mechanism to counteract the splitting and emotional responses I have to stimuli In my eyes it Äôs easier to react appropriately if you are always establishing a firm factual foundation go alliteration of events that occur instead of relying on in the moment emotional stimuli Learning about the nature of bpd and affect instability it may cause further lead me to lean onto self awareness and logic to dictate my actions While this has remained a challenge especially with family it has become more my norm and an unconscious habit despite high emotionally volatility internally However having come to a point where I Äôm in control far more often than not I feel like I Äôm constantly going through extra steps to self regulate and modify my behavior to norms or hide what I Äôm actually feeling in that process I feel like I Äôm a way I Äòsolved Äô my bpd symptoms to function well high accolades at work stable friendships and family dynamics intrinsic self worth and identify formation but inside I always know I Äôm different broken and the moment I slip up it will shock the people around me This puts SO much pressure to be perfect and hide my symptoms and past to avoid it all crumbling down I Äôve come to terms with people leaving and I Äôve come to terms that sometimes friendships are not genuine or sustainable I Äôve only told 4 people outside of my family about my BPD 2 were good Äòfriends Äô around the time learned about it I told them about what I go through how I perceive and feel the world and how sometimes that makes me want to end it I had been suicidal in the past for many tangible and abstract reasons Both those people ghosted me pretty fast and I can Äôt say I was surprised I felt Inherently unlovable and broken and did not expect acceptance in any form I spent the next half decade or so in several stages of life that included addiction homelessness and ptsd all while being so aware of my surroundings and feelings Anhedonia may have put me in a deep hole but it keep me on this earth Fortunately I was able to come out of this horrible phase of life on my own Since I Äôve always had a strong sense of resilience and inner Strength I truly believed I managed many symptoms that had plagued me and felt whole for the first time In a sense I Äôve never lost that feeling for wholeness About 2 years about I met a new fp out of nowhere It had been over 5 years since my last which ended with me crying desperately on the phone begging them not to leave This hit me so hard I felt so many emotions A lot of dormant triggers popped back up I felt like over the next year I had to relearn how to work on my BPD symptoms She had avpd and we both hurt each other a lot before we both abandoned each other I spiraled so hard and it felt like literal death but I knew that I could do it A while ago I stopped viewing my BPD as a curse and instead as a superpower My intuition physiology and emotions are assets that can lead to amazing outcomes if it utilized properly The way we feel as a person bpd can lead to real and unconditional love with the right people We have the agency and urgency to really care about others even if the approach is a work in progress I tried to reconnect with the person and we had a falling out again before we even talked about our issues the first time around I split hard and let the bpd win that round At first I felt intense shame that I was not perfect and let the symptoms beat out my awareness because that Äôs the crazy thing about bpd you may be 100 percent aware and still make the wrong decisions actions This doesn Äôt make us bad or fake it is our symptoms and we must be kind and patient with our inner child who is hurting Since then I Äôve made an amazing friend who makes me feel heard safe and understood I recently told her about my bpd and she said that won Äôt ever change anything between us and has consistently been there and shown up for me when she knows I Äôm struggling internally She checks up on me when I don Äôt check in because she doesn Äôt want me to feel abandoned Despite this I Äôm scared that it will be another failed friendship this really matters to me that my splitting which I Äôm experiencing more frequently lately will destroy it again and that I don Äôt deserve such a good friend And it feels like the closer I get to people and the closer they are to becoming my fp that Äôs when the dormant Neurosis emerge the ones I Äôve worked on for years but can suddenly ruin my relationships and life in a moment This rant was entirely too long and much longer than expected I used to journal a lot to understand but I pretty much stopped when I found out about my bpd It Äôs been a While since I Äôve truly connected with others about my diagnosis and experiences and reading experiences of others compelled me to overshare mine Hope everyone struggling with bpd knows that they are worthy of love caring and consistency and that your emotions don Äôt define who you are I can relate to your heart hurt and stand with all of you ù Ô è",

    "input": "This is my first time posting in this subreddit so I apologize if this isn t organized or anything I recently learned 2021 that I struggle with BPD I struggled admitting to myself any of the pain or the true debilitating nature of my BPD and especially the ways it affects me about romance I am not ready for romantic love which is not to say I don t deserve it hard to think I do after this but I am not ready and I m willing to admit that now which I wasn t before I don t think there was a way for me to ever be ready for a relationship I am 22 years old and I recognize I have full responsibilities for my actions even if my intentions are different from my actions but I do not have any of the emotional skills a 22 year old should have I feel like a child emotionally developmentally speaking I don t know if that is common but it s the way I feel However this conclusion only came to me after a time of crisis I cheated on this person we were not officially dating however we were committed to each other and it was completely my idea to do so and I spent a lot of effort to break down their walls because I genuinely thought and had the intention that I could be the best person possible for them but I could not be that without helping myself My childhood wasn t great my dad used to be addicted to drugs before I was born and was is an active alcoholic I recognize the ways me and my dad are similar but he refused to get help for himself at any point He s now 60 yo my mother has put up with my dad s abuse the entire time they ve been married it took me until this week to realize the way my dad treats my mom isn t how any person deserves to be treated However my view of love is poisoned because I never got love or felt it from people it was supposed to come from My dad abused me when I was younger and still continues to emotionally abuse me and did not have any skills to pass onto me to cope with any traumas or illnesses or anything Besides that though I was SA d multiple times when I was a child from a really early age between 8 11 I literally cannot remember when it occurred to me at all which I think was a survival response from my brain I wish my brain could ve just completely blanked out that that happened but I can t Every time that I should ve gotten love from my family I wasn t met with love and I don t think it s out of genuine want to hurt me or anything just I recognize I don t think my parents should have had me because the conditions I was raised in weren t conductive to me having a healthy mental state unless I was getting support from a young age which I didn t I also was groomed on the internet many many times from childhood all the way throughout all of highschool I fed off the attention of disgusting people because I felt like that is what I deserved and talking to those people was some of the only forms of attention I was getting as a child My intention in telling the above information is not to ask for pity regardless of how I was treated I shouldn t have treated this person this way if I truly loved them because you do not cheat on a person you love But I couldn t even love them they were the first person to provide me true genuine love and I couldn t do anything but reject it Almost every romantic situation beyond this one went bad for me I have terrible taste in people and I ve continually met people who met me with more trauma I was always the second option in every situation and I ve been cheated on in every situation which would make me think since it happened to me I would never do it to someone else but I did it to them They have expressed that they want to be with me like it is a genuine want in their brain however they cannot be with me and I understand that now during a 3 hour phone conversation last night I didn t understand this at all and was just begging for them to stay over and over They want to be with me that s what their brain wants however the conclusion they ve come to every time is that they cannot be with me because their paranoia won t allow them to I am willing to put in all of the work that is required to help them heal from that because I am not capable of hurting them in that way anymore I know some may not believe me but I can only admit that now knowing I was capable of hurting them before because I had terrible coping mechanisms to deal with that They told me to move on they told me I needed space from them so I could move on but my brain feels a genuine need to fix this relationship if it s possible and I am just wondering if it s able to be fixed I want to love them and think I can be a genuine loving and healthy partner for them I just needed therapy in order to process all of my traumas I don t think I am saying something wrong in saying that but regardless of how I feel now and my desire to be a better person the overwhelming thought in their brain is me hurting them and I just don t know if I can ever fix that So I am asking for perspective I apologize for this being really really long but for anyone who reads all of this even if you don t offer advice thank you",

    "input": "So I 21 M know this girl 21 F I ve known her for a very long time went to school together we ve been good friends for fairly long Now she has been in a 3 year relationship with this guy they cheated on each other more than once yet somehow always stayed together She always wanted to leave him but couldn t Eventually I told her that I was attracted to her and knew that she was too but I wouldn t want to start anything with her til she was still with this guy After some weeks she tells me that they re breaking up and after a bit more we start seeing each other regularly and having sex The relationship went good for about five months and I could tell she was into me and was having a good time too Then one day she tells me that she s going to visit her cousins for the weekend and when she returns she starts acting suspicious so I ask her what s going on but she wouldn t tell me After a long on and off she finally tells me that she didn t go see her cousins but her ex Now it s been three weeks since we haven t heard from each other anymore I m still surprised that she did what she did and why Now I know that this might seem like me trying to give myself an answer to that and me just being delusional but lately I started to inform myself on BPD and although I ve just scratched the surface I recognized a lot of patterns and behaviors that match up to hers Especially regarding relationships As soon as I started mentioning the idea of us being a couple she started to freak out yet she was the one who had always been more attached and seeming to want commitment The fact that she can t get out of the relationship with her ex the fact of her pushing away me one of her few friends that she has left A lot of thing add up And I guarantee that there is a bunch of other stuff that matches up too Now what she did is unforgivable but I feel like if she actually has BPD things would be different and I d still want her to be part of my life cause I wouldn t want to be another person that she pushes away from herself I know that she went in the past to a psychologist but for a short time It could even be that she was diagnosed but didn t tell anyone I don t know if I should tell her about it or just let it be Again I am not 100 certain The thing is I don t even know if it would be good for her to know that she has it But I kinda want to intervene because I know that she s suffering now and she doesn t want to lose me either What would you do Assuming she has BPD do you think she needs to know or is it better to just let things be I hope I didn t offend anyone I m new to all this",
