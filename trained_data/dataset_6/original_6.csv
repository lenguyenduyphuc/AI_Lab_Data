25 March 2006 UTC The opinions Tisthammer is insisting on adding are NOT about Josephson OR about Natasha Demkina They re about Profs Hyman Wiseman and me Josephson has nothing really to say about Natasha Instead he argues that we re a bunch of unethical crooks That appears to be why Tisthammer wants the link added And he doesn t care that it violates Wiki guidelines He says he s willing to compromise by allowing me to add a statement or two denying that we re a bunch of unethical crooks He calls that a compromise This is Tisthammer s idea of mediation Immediately take a side and argue for it by misrepresenting Wikipedia guidelines and the meaning of words like primary source Josephson is no primary source He s never met Natasha never tested her never spoke with her and his only personal knowledge of the Discovery Channel program comes from watching it like millions of other TV viewers He s no more a primary source than is Tisthammer himself If Tishammer wants to create a new Wiki article on Josephson s fights with skeptics he should do so and stop pretending he s a mediator There s much too much bilge in this discussion page already 13 39,Attacking Behavior

you have consistantly provoked the other side with your endless efforts in censorship of anything that even remotely disagrees with your view of events that occured during this tragic part of history By not accepting the immense suffering of Turks under the hand of the Armenians and the foreign occupiers you are in fact insluting the memory of these people This unfortunately has very much been the position of Armenians and their western supporters the fact that the value attached to the lives of non christians is far less important This sickening attitude goes on today you just have to look at dysfunctional Iraq where hundreds of thousands of civilians have been massacred in what conveniantly known as collateral damage If you had a more open mind and respect for others maybe this topic would look much better today If you are going to go back to your whining arguments of how the poor innocent armenians without provocation were massacred please refrain from doing so because we have danced to the tune so many times already,Attacking Behavior

Again I disagree with you if you were a bit more attentive you would have noticed that I put this issue into the talk page see PKEand non of the instigators bothered even to respond they were busy with a revert war This 3rr is highly unfair in this case because the other side is ganging up so you have several contributors reverting thereby avoiding a violation of the 3rr I strongly suggest that you reconsider the highly POV revert,Attacking Behavior
You re not helping me User Zora Right now I don t want to hear anything other than an explanation for why it s okay for User Khoikhoi to just go up there and remove the dispute tags placed in by others but it s not okay for me to replace a dispute tag with a one that better reflects the situation we re having,Attacking Behavior
I ask you again to reconsider your revert this point was submitted to the talk page but the vandals decided to ignore it and go into a revert war instead Unless you give me a valid reason for your revert followed by the block I cannot consider you as a neutral participant in this matter Do you really believe that your are going to resolve this issue with this attitude of yours Think again,Attacking Behavior
Watch out for the hijackers Fadix THOTH Latinus Khoikhoi nikosilver Hectorian etc They are ganging up against topics related to Turks and take turns in a revert war in order to avoid violating the 3rr These not so cunning group of Armenians Greeks and their friends are racist Turk haters and are keen to sully any topic that is even remotely related to Turks Please be vigilent on these serial hijackers they operate in tandem,Attacking Behavior
it seems you have not even bothered to read the contents of my posting above Let me repeat myself I RAISED THE ISSUE ON THE TALK PAGE before this became a revert war If you wish to ignore that point thats your perogative but if you decide to revert and then block the site I am afraid thats far from being considered a neutral stance I dont know if you realize this but with your arrogant attitude and actions you have succeeded in making this matter a whole lot worse If you were truly neutral on this matter you would have raised the issue with me and warned me regarding blocking the site You did none of that a bit like shooting the prisoner and then asking questions In light of the above I again ask you to reconsider,Attacking Behavior

Short response I have to say I haven t read all the discussions here but I can tell you re talking about race No one is talking about race here Read the article Where s race being discussed We re not talking about a Jewish race We re talking about an ethnic group Hopefully you know the difference between a race and an ethnic group An ethnic group is a group of people who closely identify with one another sometimes through having common ancestors but not necessarily so and share a unique culture and language Persian Jews definitely fall in this category They identify closely with one another for most of their history Persian Jews have been living in secluded Jewish ghettos and they most certainly share a unique culture and language Questioning the ethnicity of Persian Jews is simply absurd Let me also re quote this sentence from Britannica Encyclopedia The Jews trace their heritage in Iran to the Babylonian Exile of the 6th century BC and like the Armenians have retained their ethnic linguistic and religious identity Discussing race might not be appropriate here but discussing ethnicity definitely is,Attacking Behavior

Thanks for the comment I think has made this a little too personal and I m not even sure why This is part of a broader content dispute and he has made some statements that can only be interpreted as taking sides due to clear misunderstandings the users initiating that page are not Iranians but on the contrary are minority groups so he s reading the whole thing completely backward I m not sure what I might have done to deserve this but he tried to warn me against attacking the same user before but I did not think of it as an attack and gave a full explanation as to why No matter what happens here I m going to be filing an RfC demanding an investigation into this It looks to me like this user has a history of blocking people for unnecessary reasons Like I said this is unacceptable I called that person a troll because he was indeed using provocative language pointing me out by name and then asking me to review WP CIVIL for making an edit he doesn t like and I did not threaten him with a block I was referring to his block on Iranian peoples for violating 3RR This is unacceptable,Attacking Behavior

Care to google for at least 5 minutes before throwing tags Within 3 minutes I found the citation is quoted from I Nistor Basarabia 10 1990 p 159 Ion Nistor was a chief ideologue of Greater Romanian nationalism in the early 20th century and in the interbellum and a fierce Ukrainophobe You can read more on him in the Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine as well as here in Chernivtsi University and Rumanization articles The info in the statement is indeed dubious but the quote itself is taken from a historian s work Please stop abusing tags Nistor while biased in interpretations is an academic sholar and can be reasonably trusted on facts themselves This is a too easy and lazy approach At least care to look for the info before disrupting the articles and the other people s work with your tags,Attacking Behavior

One guy seemingly some sort of administrator deleted my contribution of fifty minutes worth of edits I went to his user page The guy is blind Blind How ridiculous that my carefully set out text with bolds and italics gets deleted by a blind person But Wikipedia gives people that power Another administrator repeatedly deleted a link I added to a page I have already added that link to three other pages without difficulty When I asked him to justify it the request was ignored When I reinstated the link I got banned by him Arbitrary I am in the hands of fools in this place Wikipedia works on the principle that He who comes early does the hard work but he who comes along later gets to dictate the form of a page What a stupid system Arbitrary wasteful silly,Attacking Behavior

Thank you very much for your encouraging words However I made my dicsion after doing a thorough checking of Arbustoos s footprints on the Wiki I notice that he has been systematically deleting information related to conservative Christians and conservative Christian organizations He mutiliates where he cannot delete And he adds information in such a clever manner that even what is right leads to humiliation An apology can be more humiliating than an insult What is more I notice that none repeat NONE has been able to stop his adventures He is freely doing what he wants to and none of you has been able to stop him from his anarchy Else show me one example where any of you has stopped him in his tracks Why is it that he has always got to be right His POVs are NPOVs while researched stuff by us is POV or simply garbage because there is no arbitrator between him and me Just show me one example of arbitration in my case I also notice that others who contributed to this article on Johnson C Philip are not raising their voice I know one of them my junior who also did research on Philip He told me he would never come back to Wiki so disappointed was he also to see Arbustoo having his way and none of you coming to arbitration We both have meaningful occupation in life and cannot fight against a person who can do anything without us having an arbitrator Thanks for being nice to me,Emotional Distress

SC Info Im almost positive that this is not the place I m supposed to be responding but there is no reply link at your message Part of the reason for my offense is that I think your being unfair in referring to it as spam If I was just posting Hey Come visit my site without any contribution that would be one thing But when I posted anything from my own site I had news attached to it You didn t have a problem when I posted the news of the departure of the producers and writers of the movie and linked to RopesOfSilicon com and you also didn t have a problem when I posted the purchase of Dreamworks by Paramount and linked to Yahoo News but when the news happened to come from my site even if it is legitimate news it s spam I happen to be in a position that I have connections and can make alot more news than other sites But that shouldn t make the news any less relivant in getting it to people When I take the time and care enough to try to make sure the info is correct only to have it removed and replaced by the same wrong information it s very frustrating and it does come back to us at Ubisoft For example someone came to the official forums and said they saw on Wikipedia that Tom Cruise had accept the role of Sam Fisher in the movie Well that is not true So I had to correct him and that has happened a few times with a few wrong pieces of information Which is why I went to the extent to find the correct info But if you are not in control of the other pages and judging by the fact that the incorrect info that I removed has been replaced it seems those who are in charge seem to perfer having incorrect information posted so my hands are tied Frankly I m getting tired of trying to help and getting railed back for what I see as petty reasons everytime Also the back and forth with you removing my fan page from the list and the two other sites to the bottom only to have me move them back was something I did because I have problems with an owner of another fansite following me around and well not being nice I was thinking it was him that was removing the info,Emotional Distress

Lists that combine categories On the AfD for List of Jewish American criminals and victims you wrote Comment Does anyone think that this sort of list is substantially different from List of Jewish actors and actresses If so I d like to understand exactly why I don t know if you re aware that in January 06 there was extensive discussion of the issue of lists that try and combine a person s ethnic or religious affiliation with something completely unrelated to that The extreme example discussed at some length there was List of Methodist dentists I missed that discussion but having looked through it recently as I ve watch the AfD comments I m really disappointed that the community did not come to an acceptable consensus on the question I see a difference between the list you cite and the list under discussion primarily because the criminals and victims is so contentious and potentially offensive We ve seen the comments from While I can see some way in which a list of people who were victims because they were Jewish gay missionaries could have merit but I m not sure it warrants inclusion on Wikipedia I cannot see how a list of criminals could have the same merit To act in a manner that is criminal is effectively a declaration that the faith into which you were born or claim by conversion is effectively a sham So I am against the list of criminals and victims remaining not only because it not doing anything of value in the context of an encyclopedia but because it is potentially offensive As for the list of actors I am against their creation since they do not seem to have encyclopedic value Such a list combines two aspects of a person s life that do not inherently have value A list of Jewish scholars of Christianity for example might be a very interesting list There is a category combination that i see has genuine value It was said that a List of Islamicist athletes has values because such athletes choose to recognise aspects of the Koran in the way that they compete women wearing a burka spelling for example So I ve come to the position that both lists you mention are unencyclopedic but was willing to accept the view of a majority that a List of Jewish actors and actresses was something I can put up with A List of Jewish American criminals and victims is too contentious to remain,Safe/Neutral

Well the Americans ignored the UN and went to War with iraq the War is still illegal whether Britain and the states want to admit it or not So when the states say you can call yourself whatever you want it does not mean much just the Americans rewardin a small nation for supporting an illegal war with an illegal name i am no greek lover but this site has made a big dicision to back this small slav state over the UN and EU So let me get this straight if Iran tomorrow renames itself death to all americans and most the inhabitants back this name as does lets say another few countries even if the UN do not recognise it this site will that is hilarious stop this insanity and give the page the title FYROM the legal name If tomorrow the UN and EU says they recognise the name republic of macedonia whether it offends all of Greece tough that should be the name But as it stands that has not happened so why pick sides The agreed name is FYROM for a reason if everyone thought Greece did not have a point they would be laughed out of the negotiations however that is not the case the UN and EU does not recognise the name Macedonia for a reason this page does not recognise the UN cool for America for the rest of us an insult to our intelligence,Safe/Neutral

Hello I noticed that you have wrote on my talk page I do know the user McFly85 personally We both were in a computer lab checking out wikipedia one time and we talked about how the quality of certain areas of articles were a little lacking He also told me about his tattered history on wikipedia where he had his user page edited without consent by SWD316 Moe Epsilon Then someone else vandalized SWD316 s user page and put the blame on mcfly which I m fairly sure he would not do Mcfly did make a few other accounts during a RFA as he was worried that if SWD316 would be given moderator powers that he would be unfairly banned And if you look at Mcfly85 s edit history he has made a wealth of good edits mainly proofreading issues but also a lot with NPOV stub sorting and even creating an article every once in awhile In my opinion even with all the alleged sockpuppet abuse mcfly85 has been a strong asset to wikipedia If it wasn t for this user as lot of previous errors and formatting mistakes would have gone unnoticed and would harm the quality of this site He had no intention of becoming a moderator but always intended to improve even if only slightly any article that was lacking quality I feel bad that the actions of Moe Elipson have pretty much caused mcfly my friend to lose trust in this site and he has since retired his name He did come back under another name and made some great edits but then was unfairly IMO banned for being a sockpuppet used abusively There is a difference between being a sockpuppet and trying to use a new name to get a fresh start But I am not mcfly85 I am fairly new to being a serious editor on wikipedia and I was just checking some various parts of the site I then noticed on the RFAs section that this familiar name came up and I saw mcfly s screenname in the questions answered by Moe Elpison I really didn t want other users have what happened to mcfly happen to them so I voted opposed which I am allowed to do as a user I do not feel that I unfairly influenced the voters I think the voting results would have been the same weather I had voted or not And I have never heard of Araxen and I did not create or am involved with that user That vote should not have counted I just wanted to explain my case to you I also question that Moe Elipson s user page may be in violation of the no personal attacks policy He calls McFly85 some very harsh names such as a stalker I think that content that bashes other users should be removed there is no place for that anywhere But thanks for asking I hope to keep making solid contibutions to the encyclopedia it s a fun hobby,Safe/Neutral

Response Sorry I never got to reply to to the message you left me on my talk page You can explain your comments all you want but the fact remains that wikipedia policy dictates that we discuss articles not users Make sure you stick to that in the future Additionally adding the unsourced tag to Iranian peoples is quite innapropriate A simple look at the page shows at least 12 sources not 0 as the tag implys Well what I was trying to explain is that I never make any personal statements about him with the exception of to promote a positive image of Iran and Iranians which as I explained later in the same section any person assuming good faith would take as an insult You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one personally pointing me out by name I never did anything comparable to this Is this in accordance with your policy of we discuss articles not users As for the unsourced tag it s been discussed in the talk page The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page The article is on Iranian peoples so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are Such a source has yet to be provided I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group that of Iranian peoples see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this I m not sure what s the best way to move on from here The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind but a lot of users are not being cooperative I d consider any advice or mediation Thanks,Safe/Neutral

Maybe the topic would be better placed under conversation though or some other word Wikipedians might find value in a tool called QuickTopic It is a free preposterously easy instant discussion space It might fill a gap between this page and the Wikipedia mailing list That is if any gaps are found between those two existing mechanisms Gaps What gaps But should this go under conversation instead I don t know I m not a linguist or communications expert Not all talking is conversation either in the general sense of talking to another person or in the stricter sense of talking to another person and listening to that other person also Perhaps this page should be strictly for the physical phenomenon of human talking Or should that be under speech Speech is the saying of the words i e a transmitter but in no way implies that the listener reciever has actually gotten anything out of it That is how UDP protocol is structured I think that talking to an active reviever TCP is really what conversation is about but communication of ideas requiring understanding on the part of the reciever is very far beyond the scope of talk If I talk to a duck that is a speech for while the duck may hear not much else is happening Somebody send us a linguist Ask Any decision made on this yet Seems like the article could be considered redundant with other articles and hard to define based on what I ve seen here Should we keep it If you create this page geeks will come If you delete this page geeks will want to create it again Some people will travel thousands of miles to see the Worlds Largest Rubber Band Ball I went to Talk just so I could come in here and see Talk Talk see recursion The experience was less frustraiting than Talk Sex but not as good as I have removed this paragraph because I thought it didn t really add something to the article and sounds like a joke to me Talk is also used when talking to other people in Standard English you would say i am talking to someone However this varies when we look at Australian South African or Estuary English This is due to changes in dialect In Standard Australian English one would say I m talkin to someone darl and in South African one would say I m talking to someone yis and in Estuary English one would say Can t yoow see im talkin to someone love Just give me a minute Chavs completely mangle the word talk and would instead say Your chattin sh t And thus the history of the english language is clearer for another day sleep tight kids Perhaps this is my noobieness showing but could one somehow make a disambiguation page for the subject I made a disambiguation page last week but after reading this discussion I think it would be for the best if I act unilaterally and move Talk to Talk Unix and move Talk disambiguation to Talk And therefore that is what I am going to do Ta Ra Teehee there really is a Talk Talk I feel special now If I were to slit my wrists right now I would die a happy man,Suicidal Reference

82 43 210 155 Hope you don t mind but I extended your block of 82 43 210 155 to one week It was the second time and the vandalism was pretty bad First 24 hour block didn t seem to do the trick so I felt one week may No problems if you want to use your time I just wanted to notify you of the change Thanks for reverting vandalism to my user page â Seen this already I know two of your brothers e Moline 2 A few days ago I asked you why you reverted my efforts on the Moline Illinois page and either I didn t get a response from you or I didn t receive it In your initial message to me given at the time when you reverted all of the work I had done you called my efforts vandalism and nonsense I realize this is probably a auto generated message sent in response to a flagged accidental event but given that I ve made several attempts to communicate to you via this page as well as four or five times thru the original vandalism nonsense to which to you responded once with I might add a tone that was less than in keeping with the tone I see when I read the messages on this page Nevertheless what I was trying to accomplish with the Moline page was to take a wikipedia entry that was woefully lacking and add some real value to it I had added the the Moline page a location air travel major interstate highways sports gambling and landmarks and notable bridges sections Additionally I completely revamped the schools section into an education section that provided internal and external links to every school mentioned You removed all of that BTW I tried to document all of my efforts in the Discussion page so anyone could see what I was trying to do make the Moline page better Before I found it it was little more than a glorified rundown of which neighborhood has more Mexicans than the next and I found it simply too racist to let stand Yes I also was trying to edit the Neighborhood section to remove the racism but also better demonstrate the real flavor and history of the town Thanks to you the history and flavor is gone and the racism is back Congratulations A final request if you see fit to keep my efforts out of the wiki then please be so kind as to be consistent for I still see the results of my writing on the Moline page IF you are going to remove my work and have the Moline page reflect the rants of one racist hick please be consistent and completely remove all of my work either keep all of my work in or none of it Thanks and kind regards 07 March 2006 UTC â The preceding unsigned comment was added by â UTC,Attacking Behavior

Dear Resid I am sorry you disagree with my actions I did not prevent you from being able to edit your talk page in any way your block allowed you to edit your talk page and I did not protect the page please verify this from the logs of my protections for yourself and indeed I cannot see any evidence that another admin did so I have not deleted any page you created to date I am afraid I am not aware of the report on vandalism page you are referring to You can likewise inspect the log of my deletion actions to confirm that I have not deleted any pages that you created As for editing after discussing I agree but there is no rule that states all edits must be discussed first on the talk page and indeed although I would agree on such a course of action where multiple users disagreed with a particular change it seems clear in this case it was merely you disapproved of any changes being made to the Wikiethics page whatsoever Although blanking pages is indeed vandalism the removal of text in the manner of editorial modification is certainly not vandalism You cannot simply revert changes you dislike I am afraid Wikipedia does not work like that Please take this as a lesson as I will be forced to block you again if you continue such behaviour and considering that many other admins apart from myself have blocked you on numerous occasions eventually you may find yourself indefinitely banned by community decision I would sincerely hope an intelligent individual such as yourself would modify your behaviour to prevent such a course of action being necessary Regards,Attacking Behavior
Hey glad to hear from you This is Jazzy Admittedly I am extremely frustrated with user dcandeto and my actions have been less than perfect but I wrote an article for a journalism class on a well known guy named Cody Hedman and Dcandeto hounded on it until it was deleted I felt I did not get ample time to discuss the article before it was taken down I admit I made several accounts trying to get around dcandeto Firstly I created Cdub1985 a run off of the guy I wrote about and then jazzy 006 jazzy 007 and I got my friends to try and keep it on Honestly my attacks against dcandeto have been stupid and anger motivated and attempting to delete his article was an act of frustration but I do not feel he asserted the importance of the writer he wrote about Honestly what I wrote was not a vanity article and I just thought it would be cool to have an article on wiki but the way I was so quickly attacked and had nothing explained to me was unreasonable and I retaliated You know I treated dcandeto bad but I feel he should be more understanding and helpful towards newcomers instead of trying to delete work ASAP Thanks Jazzy,Attacking Behavior

And nobody has PROVED the accuracy of the article The part about Gwen not being able to pass was culled from many people that knew Gwen well and stated that Gwen could not pass In the Rolling Stone article it was mentioned that Gwen could not get a job because of her visible transgendered status in other words that she was clearly a biological male Most Photos of Gwen look to be a biological male made up as a female You can insist over and over that this is not the case but it clearly is Gwen was also attacked weeks before by people who clearly recognized her tyransgendered status Yet we are supposed to believe that almost everyone Gwen came into contact with knew she was transgendered until she met up with these three men and their group of friends Somehow they were magically oblivious to what most others can clearly see QUOTE That doesn t make her dangerous behavior a way to wink and say well she got what she deserved QUOTE I NEVER implied that Gwen deseved to be murdered and that is a sick contention of your part Gwen clearly engaged in behavior that put her at great risk of someone raping killing or beating her When the Transgendered do not have a support system in place and by that I mean qualified professionals as well as understanding friends and family they are at great risk Gwen s family as well as friends were no doubt sympathetic and loving but Gwen had no other support or therapy Gwen should have been in a support group at the very least and perhaps been transitioning after therapy before attempting to passing in public which is very dangerous in most places no matter how passable the person is or believes themselves to be Yes these guys are scum and thats even more reason to take any motivation they claim with a grain of salt But the bottom line is Gwen should have been more cautious And lets honsetly answer the question once and for all Was Gwen wrong in not revealing her gender status before having anal sex with some of these men And it has been widely reported that it was anal not oral sex I find it impossible to believe that if it was indeed oral sex that not one of these purported hetrosexual males made a boob grab This whole situation does not pass the smell test,Attacking Behavior

Yopie your edits are huge pro Czech POV First you are citing really bad book about Czech history and second there wasn t so much people in the area as you pointed it out Majority were Polish with notable and fairly sizeable German and Czech communities not to mention lively Jewish community which you do not even mention There are plenty of documents about situation in Zaolzie in archives Article about ÄŒT is NPOV now vandals like you are trying to rewrite history and confuse readers,Attacking Behavior
Where are you from man You can find many documents about it in local Cieszyn Silesia and TÄ Å Ã n Silesia archives both Czech and Polish Statements in that oxford book are false there were much more Germans here more Poles and less Czechs It not even mention Jews Erik Goldstein s book which is cited here tells about Polish majority here that s why the Polish Army annexed this territory most of the people were Poles deal with it Also author of that oxford crappy simplyfying book tells about Zaolzie area so I don t know why you added it to ÄŒeskÃ½ TÄ Å Ã n article There is nothing pro Polish in this article liberation would be pro Polish there is an annexation term here etc This is perfectly npov article Btw I am Czech but hate that nationalist pov pushers like you,Attacking Behavior

Serbian casualties again Just one link more to the already existing ones numbered above http www aimpress ch dyn trae archive data 199711 71128 026 trae beo htm It is perfectly understandable for Serbian apologists to try to minimize the Serbian death toll in battles civilian Serbian casualties are as usual inflated beyond beyond The reason High military casualties figure speaks of Serbian military incompetence as contrasted to their self image of a Ramboid nation also it is a sign of heavy Yugoslav involvement in agression on Croatia Anyone s national sensibilities aside it is clear that all realiable and available sources put the Serbian military death toll at the lowest level of 8 000 The article is signed by Stipe Sikavica a typical Croatian name so it again represents a Croatian press POV Here s another nice example of nationalist logic What you re basically saying is that this journalist cannot possibly be objective because he is Croatian is that it Infact you are drawing this conclusion solely out of the man s NAME What if he changed his name maybe he would be more neutral then what do you think Even in that link you could not see that anyone from serbian side states something like 10 000 According to Serbian sources regarding the number of Serbian soldiers who died or went missing during all the wars in Slovenia Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina the number often mentioned is 2 300 and most of them around a half are believed to have died in the battle for Vukovar The cited article states also that most experts agree with the figure There are no reason to put 8 000 or 10 000 as official data These data are contraversial Croatian sources ie general Anton Tus put the Serbian military casualties figure around 10 000 Other sources like brigadier general Mile DedakoviÄ in his book Bitka za Vukovar put the highest limit around 12 000 Therefore chief Croatian estimates revolve around 10 k Serbian military casualties This page is not about what Serbian sources say exclusively Without going into details of questionable veracity of Serbian sources re this battle the most correct approach is to state what both sides have to say And in the cited article by a journalist named Sikavica it is clear for anyone who is not deaf blind and mute that some Serbian military figures agree with general Tus s estimates It is explicit Therefore reverted I ve seen this later It s not just the number of Serbian military casualties after all these were mainly puzzled conscripts sent to the slaughterhouse It s this sick worldview prevalent in some Serbian circles Croatian paramilitaries secession liberation of Vukovar then liberation of Srebrenica faked Markala lies about everything and everyone for those conversant with Croatian just a slice http www hic hr books jugoistocna europa dedijer htm kraj 20mita,Attacking Behavior

13 April 2006 UTC Hi Heah Thanks for your reply First I wrongly assumed that Jossi had started the deletions He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting I didn t know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward I still maintain however that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism They weren t corroborative edits that s for sure They were as I said wholesale repeated deletions of original text You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but in this case I can assure you that s not the problem Jossi s full aware of the fact that both Geaves comments and Rawat s own contradictory words in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival are proven and accurate Here s a link to the Geaves article Footnote 5 is the one where Geaves relieves Rawat of any knowledge or responsibility for the Millenium hype And here s a link to the letter Rawat himself wrote which clearly puts the lie to Geaves revisionism The Wiki rule about vandalism states that most is dealt with by fast reversions However it doesn t say that persistent efforts in this regard may nonetheless violate the three reversion rule and trigger blocking It does seem a little Kafak esque don t you think Finally on the more general complaint I have about Jossi Fresco I do invite you to take some time if you would and review his editing of the Rawat articles He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader a man who still has many many followers who believe that he is God in human form Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man The fact that he s a Wikipedia administrator is worrying in my opinion 18 13,Attacking Behavior
Don t worry it was just a typo with brackets omitted a frequent case with the longer sentences or those involving a few disparate concepts Also the quotation marks were intentional because ustaÅ e were not negative nor positive it was a historical reaction of the part of the Croatian nationalist movemnent to the years of the Serbian oppression To define it as negative would be as absurd to define Soviet Communism the most murderous regime on earth as negative or positive Those Croats and Bosnian Muslims who volunteered to take part in the UstaÅ ka vojnica more than 40 000 people in 1943 cannot be labelled as war criminals nor as traitors as anti Croat propaganda would have it in the Communist Yugoslavia period The pathological murderers like Maks LuburiÄ or totalitarian dictators like Ante PaveliÄ cannot cast the shadow on all the participants in the UstaÅ a military forces any more than Joseph Mengele or Adolf Hitler can contaminate the memory of German soldiers particularly Waffen SS who fought in the WW2 This is even more true about ordinary people or intellectuals who participated in the NDH regime for instance Adolfo Bratoljub KlaiÄ the author of famous dictionary of foreign words or the sculptor AugustinÄ iÄ who made a bust of PaveliÄ but later switched sides Do I have to repeat The NDH was a quisling state The vast majority of people involved with it and working for it were neither quislings nor criminals And this is just the NDH talk Let s not forget that as far as resistance movement goes the Croats were the majority both in leadership and in fighting forces who were not forced to join the resistance like the Serbs in the NDH but did it out of ideals And in the percentage of participation heavily outnumbering other nations in ex Yugoslavia except pehaps Montenegrins http www hercegbosna org engleski ww2 html Hmmm I haven t seen anything that would refute the claim that Serbian propagandists are vandalizing not a few wikipedia pages solely with the aim of spreading anti Croat chauvinist hatred,Attacking Behavior

What would you do Xerox pages of a book I unlike you read 2 years ago And which proves what That in StarÄ eviÄ s political career the term Slavosrb was used exclusively for enemies as he saw them of Croatian independence The main Slavosrbs were Strossmayer Germans Hapsburg monarchy and the so called Khuen Serbs the Serbs living in Croatia and affilliated with the hated political regime of oppression How come that vast majority of political representatives of Serbs in Croatia more than 98 had been during the most oppressive period in the 19th century collaborators of Khuen regime Truly these Serbs or Orthodox Vlachs who nationally awoke as Serbs in mid and 2nd half of the 19th century had fully deserved the Slavosrbs tag in StarÄ eviÄ s lingo unlike the descendandts of Orthodox Vlachs who were StarÄ eviÄ s followers Stjepan MiletiÄ August HarambaÅ iÄ DuÅ an Kotur DuÅ an VlaisavljeviÄ Milan OgrizoviÄ No one can rationally deny anyone s ethnic affiliation this is certain The fact that StarÄ eviÄ did this to the descendands of the Orthodox Vlachs is not a sign of political wisdom or even ordinary logic But it must be underscored that he reacted to the denial of Croatian ethnic affiliation promulgated by Vuk KaradÅ¾iÄ s pan Serbian ideology And this must not be forgotten who had begun with this game of denial Who wanted another people s extirpation Whose idenmtity was forged among other things upon cultural theft and misappropriations Who spoiled the well http www hic hr books greatserbia,Attacking Behavior

Dealing with Geaves trustworthiness as a Rawat scholar Rather than get into another reversion war I ll do it this way I propose posting the same paragraph I put up the other day Obviously you premies don t like it but the fact is it s apparent beyond question that Geaves has misrepresented the truth about Rawat s role in the Millenium hype Geaves said In November 1973 Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90 000 The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U S with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji s appearance at the stadium as a second coming complete with angelic and alien visitors Only 20 000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers expectations He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises Whereas in a broadly disseminated letter to all his followers Rawat described the upcoming program as the most Holy and significant event in human history intimated that the festival wasn t just for him and his followers but the whole world and maybe the whole universe and suggested that it was time for his followers to help him bring peace to this Earth Any fair reader can clearly see the serious discrepancy between Geaves account and the documentary evidence,Attacking Behavior

the real discussion is not about m z or m q but it is about wether the mass to charge ratio is a physical unit of dimension mass charge or wether it is a dimensionless unit As someone who is interested in physics you may understand that I have real problems seeing a dimensionless m z on the mass to charge ratio page It is the equivalent to have for example the electronic charge in the article of the electric current This is the problem that I think you re either misunderstanding or too stubborn about your POV to accept Whether or not you want to discuss the usage of m z it still is accepted by IUPAC which btw is not in any way a minority but reflects majority opinion amongst chemists The wiki entries on notations standards units and the like should reflect nothing other than what bodies like IUPAP IUPAC and ISO etc deicide I think you ll at least concede that your particular view about m z is far more of a minority position than that of IUPAC s Because I agree with you I said that you should be allowed the opportunity to add a brief explanation of why there may be confusion along with a discussion of other units and to add an external link to any reputable journal where there has been a discussion of the problems of m z The most recent edit still looks like an attempt to completely discredit the concept of m z altogether which is still your POV Please keep the rest of the discussion about this mediation on the mediation page,Attacking Behavior

Follow up You reduce false rape claims to people women changing their minds But if rape is sex without consent it does not require anyone changing his mind It can be people feeling ambivalent or curious beforehand Ambivalence or curiousity do not imply consent Cooperation does not imply consent And you cannot prove consent unless you have maybe signed a consent form into which you could have been tricked coerced to sign Don t you see the huge plunge into plain old fashioned insanity the legal system takes when rape is sex without consent I am aware that it is hard for women to get rape claims heard etc I am aware of that What I am trying to explain to you is this is exactly the result of exaggerated rape claims If rape was just a special form of assault there would not be little misunderstanding to what constitutes a rape and what not This would serve the potential victims as well as everybody else especially the legal system and the police I am not familiar enough with the example of South Africa that you bring up From experience if a statisticly huge drop like 60 in a short time for something that is greatly influenced by social mores which usually take 50 to 150 years to change then this is most likely caused by a change in the way the figures are obtained You bring up the example of date rape not being covered by the definition of sex by force You have some pretty messed up ideas Drugs are force For example the police tries to use knock out gas to remedy certain hostile situations and they refer to these gases as non lethal force Similiar to another example where people are just holding you down not hurting you to rape you holding someone down by force is force Locking someone up in a basement only to offer food and water in exchange for sexual service is also using force if you have thought about bringing that example up The second half of your post mostly rambles about how expensive guns are Yes they are way too expensive but the reason for them being expensive has a lot to do with government regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of firearms As for an unsightly bulge when carrying a weapon I ve got some more unsightly bulges than that and women tend carry purses perfect for concealed carry So women have an easier time to carry guns God I want it to be socially acceptable for men to carry a purse But then again it looks like total ass Every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times Because violence is the very foundation of a state The state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people and instead claims a monopoly on violence and resolves disputes with a legal system and enforces the laws with an armed police force But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse totalitarian laws dictatorships Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose that is the well being of the citizens and replace it with a new government preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line As such any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly,Attacking Behavior

Braille the world s first binary character encoding When I first found the article alleging this I altered it simply because the writer appears not to have heard of geomantic figures I wake up this morning to find that in the space of my few hours of sleep a contributor called Petri Kohn has submitted a discussion article entitled occult nonsense and the article has reverted to its original inaccuracy Whatever we think of occult practices the fact remains that the geomantic figures are a binary code just as much as Braille This is therefore skulduggery and POV gone mad but I have merely placed a factually disputed notice for the time being,Attacking Behavior

Alright First to your analysis Information darwinism is the opposition to pig headedness Bring me the right arguments and I will be convinced as anyone should be But failing to do so you cannot convince me You cannot convince me by begging threats bullying bribing and whatever else you can think of Only the argument is what counts What s right is not defined by the mainstream opinion If 2000 years ago people largely figured slavery was the right thing or that the earth was flat or that violent computer games turn people into mass murderers that doesn t make it anyhow right The truth is not found by a demoscopic process but instead by an organic darwinistic process that Information darwinism tries to understand and act in accordance with I do consider your thoughts on the subject flawed on a deeper level Part of our problem to communicate is certainly because of the limitations of language When we use words and you understand certain words to have a different meaning than how I understand them e g Force then we can not engage in a proper dialogue without first sorting out the terminology required So if you do find that I use a word in a different way than how you would use it or anything else weird request from me a definition of the term This is purely the linguistic barrier that must be overcome Now to some items that I seem to have brushed over The data suggest rape victims suffer more psychological trauma than other victims of assault What data By what standards Someone beaten into a bloody pulp robbed or whatever may well suffer more severe psychological trauma than someone who is victim to rape by lax standards These are problems rooted in terminology If you want us to waste literally weeks to figure out the truthfulness of the statement rape victims are off worse than regular assault victims then I have to say no thanks Because as a categorical statement I can tell you right away that is false You claim to want rape treated simply as assault in one instance and then go and suggest it should be a special form of assault which it is It is a special form of assault That does not mean it needs to be treated with different standards than other specicific better terminology forms of assault Assault with a gardening rake is also a special form of assault that doesn t mean it has to be treated fundamentally different from assault with a pitchfork Again terminology appears to be the problem Having rape as a separate category of crime allows for special systems to be in place for victims and court systems This is not something that I have brushed over That is what you appear to be in favor of I disagree strongly If someone s victim of a criminal offense he should not be treated specially that is not like other victims of criminal offenses Otherwise you are just asking for rape victims being ridiculed by society police legal system while non sexual assault victims get treated fairly I claim that only if there is no legal difference between sexual assault and non sexual assault that sexual assault victims and perpetrators can be treated fairly as everyone would wish Who do you actually propose giving these weapons to How exactly is it my job to decide who should get weapons I would assume similiar standards to car ownership and gun ownership should be applied Both cars and guns are extremely dangerous in the wrong hands lethal weapons you might say but both serve an useful purpose Security and Transportation I do not think that anyone should be denied the right to own a handgun And I certainly do not credit a state institution with the rights to decide who gets to own one and who doesnt But what exactly are you asking me for Elaborate the legislature of my dreams I don t see sense in asking me that Well there you have it Basically all of the issues I have brushed over in your mind come down to linguistic issues terminology and the such The answers are irrelevant as they can never be given without a ludicrous amount of detail given to the questions I ve known this This is one of the underlying problems that you have You fail to identify different uses of terminology and resolve them accordingly But I would suspect that we have even deeper still disagreements on very many things than just the attitude of resolving conflicts of terminology This is why I suspect your methodology of thinking is deeply flawed rather than my own And that is why I tried to tell you You first need to get your shit straight before we can argue on actual subjects like rape legislature and social consequences thereof in a productive manner I assume you will misunderstand many of the things I said in this post right,Attacking Behavior

Right Well here s what I ve done just now Changed section heading modern philosophy to philosophical topics to move the article more in line with Lac s proposal The text there still reads in a historical sort of way but that shouldn t distract the presentation of the broader themes and ideas presented A single paragraph in the philosophical topics section was transferred a section up into the historical section under the subheading modern western philosophy A bit of text in the rationalism empiricism subsection misleadingly implied that Locke was a naturalist and Hume the first empiricist This is obviously wrong so I changed it Something problematic the sentence During this era religious philosophy did not play a large role in the struggles that occupied secular philosophy is either misleading assuming secular philosophy to mean not on the face of it pertaining to issues of God etc or trivially true assuming the same to mean completely non religious philosophy Assuming the former and assuming we take this era to mean the Modern era it counts as a counter example that Descartes was completely religious that God was his one of his clear and distinct solutions to the dilemmas in the Meditations Locke s generally secular outlook on politics had great stake in religion the man thought atheists were not to be trusted and was at pains to advocate religious toleration on grounds that did not have to admit the fallibility of religion The more stark example of Berkeley already mentioned in the text is an understatement it is not just his disputes with Newton but rather absolutely anything that Berkeley said which could not be divorced from his religious views including his theory of vision Malebranche is another example It s my impression that there wasn t a genuine cooling off from appeals to religion until the late modern period So I recommend the sentence be scrapped,Safe/Neutral

links Dharmabum420 and others seem to enjoy removing links from the article I am not a webmaster or even know one I found the site outside the wall on my space and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites I think it deserves a link here with the others I must admit I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin but since then have fixed that Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion well I simply just copied the title of the page it is not self promotion Since then I have written what features the site holds but it continues to be removed Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia so stop treating it as one Thank you please keep the link I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here I ll assume that it s not self promotion despite the earlier greatest site ever type description but regardless I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site for a variety of reasons Wikipedia is not a link repository and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article and we already have far more than that No Google hit within the first 100 links in a pink floyd search and no Alexa rating while not a set policy on Wikipedia such rankings are often used to determine a site s notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well stocked with other high rated sites The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people s tattoos While mildly interesting it s hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos Much content on the site is commerical marketing T shirts and the like This is clear in the discography which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums available on Wikipedia itself anyway with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account The site in question is very low quality compared to the rest of the resource links confusing messy and difficult to navigate intrusive music with no way of turning it off and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1 5 and Safari perhaps others that s what I ve got to try That s my 2Â on this particular site a I ll double s 2Â and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel It s a very sub par site and doesn t contribute anything to this article I will disagree with both of you while you claim only one fan site is appropriate it clearly states Note fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details For example this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd Visit the other sites none of them have this info and this is just one instance You are wrong about it being the normal material Also after paying attention to this site for sometime it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying many fans love this I am one of them I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page just like fleeting glimpses bar Also every site has a discography but very few have a videography this alon makes this site better then most So it has some comercial availability so what It still is a great source of info Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos probably far more then you think because I for one know of no other site that has this and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself This site deserves a link and I disagree with both of you Also now that I think about it show me another site that streams Davids mermaid gig or has each of his promo videos for tracks of the new album Not even DG com has those avaialable anymore Also how about the interview on the Roger waters tour page Link the other fansite that has this None do This site was also the first that had Rogers complete touring band lineu,Safe/Neutral

result will be a stronger article 1 I do not want to hide Darwin but give him is place where he belongs as a historical figure and definition 2 What I have seen in the old talk before I arrived and during the time that I have been here is that all specialists try it work on this and leave disillustioned I agree with Slrubenstein above I have long argued that my position Endler s position position 1 high up in this discussion page is a current scientific one and very closely linked with Darwin s Excatly it is A current one Not THE current one making that THE definition is WP NOR I agree with Slrubenstein and think Darwin belongs at top Kim I still can t see the prob with top containing 1 a darwin defn 2 a statement that darwin s thinking changed like a good scientist 3 current defn On readability the tortured remnants of a previous editor s prose needs to go It confuses because the old definitions are incorrect Kim I do not see how you can say this unless you agree with Henry Ford that history is bunk Most people are interested in history and there are even scientists who are interested in the history of their science That it confuses you does not mean as I think is now evident that it will confuse most readers of this encyclopedia They understand that things change They also understand that trends have beginnings It is simply meaningless to say the old definition is incorrect If you do not understand why I urge you to read up on the philosophy of science definitions are more or less useful It was that old definition that led to a line of inquiry that has led evolutionary scientists to more precise and more useful understandings of the process If anything as educators we should show readers how scientists start with one formulation of natural selection and then refine it You know the fact that you reject Darwin s definition of natural selection does not mean natural selection and the theory of evolution are wrong On the contrary it simply means that science has a history that scientists debate and refine concepts which necessarily change over time Do you think this is a trivial point In the United States at least you are dead wrong If you are not from the US let me tell you there is a huge creationist movement which has on numerous ocassions had the theory of evolution banned from high schools And you should know that one argument they make is that Darwin was well as you say incorrect See they exclaim even scientists say Darwin was wrong We should no longer teach evolution Obviously they misunderstand the way science works They do not understand that scientists refine and develop theories without necessarily rejecting them I think scientists have an obligation to educate people about this Showing how scientists accept an idea and then change its definition or conceptualization by refining it without repudiating it is the best way to accomplish this You confuse hiding Darwin versus focusses on current usage first and add darwin s definitions in the history section Okay but with all due respect you confuse starting with Darwin for focussing on Darwin They aren t the same There are two reasons for starting with Darwin one it is a reasonable starting point two whatever differences there are between you Axel Marco and others or among different scientists who have published on natural selection all can agree that Darwin introduced the idea Why not just say Natural selection as first introduced by Darwin refered to Since Darwin evolutionary scientists have revised his definition based on new findings in genetics and molecular biology The lead should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it could stand on its own as a concise version of the article I just do not think starting with an out of data definition does the job Lets agree to disagree and I will work on a,Safe/Neutral

Amerindianarts if you are referring to synthetic a priori knowledge such as mathematical principles you are absolutely correct â today such principles are continually honed and developed and work side by side with empirical investigation of the natural world Best it should be avoided in the introductory paragraph then Pls see my remarks below The distinction between empirical knowledge and a priori knowledge is quite basic and can be found in any of a large number of standard philosophy textbooks Nonetheless if it is to be controversial in this article it whould be avoided in the introductory paragraph of the article at least until the article is cleaned up and contains reasonable explanations of these various empirical slants sampled further down in the article Since this article requires cleanup anyway I may as well start in bit by bit with some info and references to several such standard textbooks To begin the historical background if it is to be included at all is needed going all the way back to the debate between Plato and Aristotle yes innate vs empirical knowledge derived from sense perception It is a debate that continues even today except that in the context of accepted scientific investigation self evident a priori principles are no longer regarded as acceptable for at least the past hundred to two hundred years with the notable exception of what are known as synthetic a priori statements generally mathematical in nature Please be patient with the process and I will do my best to provide sourcing at least on this page and where needed in the article itself as well,Safe/Neutral

A warning by another editor But who polices Blocking Is it like grafitti Anyone can do it Can it be done on a whim Can someone block another because Gamaliel with the back of his hand to his forhead claims harassment Look before you leap Here is some examples of Gamaliel s editing work Perhaps Bishonen should block Gamaliel 2 26 2006 Gamaliel said an editor was pushing disproved chin nonsense AGAIN 2 24 2006 Gamaliel said oh lord not the mauser and the big chin nonsense again 2 17 2006 Gamaliel said another editor was being quite obnoxious 2 16 2006 Gamaliel said an editor was making an absurd claim 1 30 2006 Gamaliel said an editor wanted to insert conspiracy nonsense into the article 1 24 2006 Gamaliel called an editor s information rambling barely coherent rants 1 19 2006 Gamaliel refered to an editor s position as your ridiculous objections 1 12 2006 Gamaliel said he was going to remove this Mauser nonsense 1 2 2006 Gamaliel said that a contribution is nuts 12 31 2006 Gamaliel decided someone s edits were a mess 9 21 2006 Gamaliel accused an editor of offensive amateur analysis,Attacking Behavior
How not to vandalize Recently Timothy Usher has made repeated attempts to unilaterally remove content without consensus I ve reverted these and will continue to do so within the limits of 3RR If Tim wants to make major changes such as these mass deletions he s going to need to get a consensus here first If he does I will honor it,Attacking Behavior
Since he has refused to justify his deletions and obtain consensus approval I ll be reverting at will Sorry if other people s changes get wiped out in the process but this sort of collateral damage is typical when people like Tim decide to edit war to support their vandalism,Attacking Behavior
As I explained immediately above and you failed to respond to my reversion is based on content and consensus not cabalhood You are removing large blocks of text on your whim This is unacceptable Obtain consensus approval BEFORE making the changes or I will revert them repeatedly just as I would any other vandalism This is not a content dispute because you ve made no comments about the content,Attacking Behavior
Anthony Bonafe Nlu Do you ever read defense magazines Or perhaps watch the news You probably never heard about this person since the news that provided coverage about him was in Washington State on KOMO News 4 and on top of that he was interviewed in Defense Weekly so please stop messing with my content on Mr Bonafe,Attacking Behavior
Someone please totally copyedit this Scientists occasionally invent hypothetical entities with special abilities as part of a thought experiment These demons have abilities that are nearly limitless but they are still subject to the physical laws being theorized about For example in Descartes Second Meditation it is argued as a thought experiment that it is at least possible that there is an all powerful evil demon who is deceiving me such that this demon causes me to have false beliefs including the belief that there is an object before me and the belief that two plus three equals five Note that the power of such a demon would be two fold both empirical and rational thinking can be completely compromised This leads to a worrisome argument 1 One knows some fact or other only when one can rule out that there is such a demon 2 But one can never be in a position rule out that there is such a being since we can never be sure that the demon isn t merely toying with our epistemic situation 3 Thus we can never know any facts at all I hate it when people need to be slammed in the face WIKIPEDIA IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA NOT A COLUMN I was too lazy to understand what it reads there so please someone if that is a joke or something too lazy to think right now then remove it I guess,Attacking Behavior
National Security Your recent reversion violates national security It is in your best interests to stop because I am George W Bush and I will not allow anybody to spread information about the military We need to win this war on terror and you are trying to harm the war effort I have half a mind to charge you with treason or the Patriot Act A K A George W Bush president of the US,Attacking Behavior
National Security I m George W Bush and this article violates national security Failure to eliminate it will result in criminal charges and the shutting down of Wikipedia A K A George W Bush president of the US,Attacking Behavior

Unethical actions by an admin named The context of the supposed WP NPA violation is highly relevant My comment was made in response to an ideologically motived 3RR violation report filed against me Since that wasn t working for him Nandesuka figured I needed to be silenced which is why he dug through the history and found this excuse after the fact Note that Nandesuka shouldn t even be involved in this in any official capacity since he s an admin who has had many content disputes with me over his unalloyed support for cirumcising all penises As a member of the Snippies he is too biased to participate in this case and his actions show that he s a sore loser who is abusing his newly gained admin rights to silence me so that I can t defend myself from the charges of 3RR violation I request that this block be removed so that I can correct false statements being made in my 3RR report and clear my good name Thank you for your prompt response,Attacking Behavior
His edits do suck which is why I reverted them over and over again Not one edit contributed positively to the article and most served the needs of the Crusaders In any case I ve pointed out that my comment about him sucking was reverted by me immediately It is my practice to write honestly then go back and edit myself before submitting In this I missed one spot and had to edit it after submitting as I mentioned in my edit comment Since nobody saw the original unless they dug through the history and since nobody ever needed to warn me about it your excuses are nonsense You just wanted to silence me so I couldn t defend myself from the ideologically motivated 3RR violation report Even before you got a badge you have made it a practice to litter my user page with spurious warnings which has earned you the honor of being the only person whose text I erase on sight from my Talk page You are a stalker Since you are the guilty party your response here is not sufficient I would like an objective third party to respond regarding this abusive block by you,Attacking Behavior
I was not being active that is a lie Someone else has been using the account Don t know how buit they have You really are pathetic Youraskin for unprotection holds up as little as your defence that your weren t the vanbdal to my userpage I do hope your RfA fails you are a truly dishonest and disreputable little boy,Attacking Behavior
No becauise while you re busily self nominating yourself for admin you don t want the truth about your vandalising your abuisve and bulying editing and your lies and libel to be highlighted Maybe you shoudl be civil rather than vandalsiing user pages making false and libellous accustaios of sockp puppetry and generally acting like a silly little boy Haven t you got some bread to go and cut and leave imporetant things to grown ups,Attacking Behavior
You ve just libelled me one of many you have done by claiming I have used socvk puppets and claiming I have done again You are a liar You are peddling the personal attacks This is exactly why you shouldn t be allowed to edit WP let alone be an admin SHameful behaviour Why not come back in ten years or so when you ve grown up,Attacking Behavior
I agree but then it was quite annoying to be informed that a known vandal to my user page YOU had asked for the page to be unprotected for no good reason I wonder what you were planning I wonder whether you were the person misuing the account,Attacking Behavior
Significant numbers being about 5 If you re interested in anything other than disruption you ll drop this,Attacking Behavior
The rules against incivility and personal attacks are great in principle but it only takes a little bit of misinterpretation for them to be twisted into a weapon against all disagreement Witness this case where you are penalizing me for saying that Deskana would be an incompetent admin I stand by this assertion he lacks the skills necessary to do the admin job I also stand by the assertion that there are others out there who became admins but are likewise incompetent To penalize me for even expressing my views is to stifle all debate and turn Wikipedia into a censored environment In short your reasoning is suspect as is your competency You were required to rule on an existing block not search my Talk page for unrelated material that you can use to justify it Calling someone actually or potentially incompetent is a reasoned conclusion not a personal attack In contrast your thin skinned response is in violation of the spirit of free inquiry that drives Wikipedia Since you did not attempt to do your job I will once again raise the flag in hopes of a more competent admin noticing Your services however will no longer be required Jareth You can join Nandesuka on my short list of admins who have proven their incompetence,Attacking Behavior
As I mentioned your spurious warnings were worthless and I erased them on sight Like this block they were an attempt to intimidate me so that I wouldn t keep correcting the gross distortions on the circumcision articles that you Snippies think you own In short you are incapable of legitimately warning me and unqualified to block me This is because as I have pointed out and will gladly repeat you act in bad faith Remember when you reverted that edit about coagulation for no other reason than to help your Snippy budies win an edit war Remember how you were unable to come up with a justification for this even after the fact Since that day I have known that you are not to be trusted Your bias is a simple matter of fact If stating facts is in violation of WP CIVIL and WP NPA then it s time for that RfC to ban me for good because I m not ever going to stop until you make me,Attacking Behavior

Some of these things I have already changed or deleted A province really does not have a monetary policy though it can do some things e g about the availability of cash and the phrase was too general to begin with so that s gone I changed did nothing to stop to did not work to stop though your criticism is valid Note however that when De la RÃºa took office Argentina was already in recession or on the brink of it and the government concentrated on contractive measures from the start Then came the corralito etc On the whole the measures were intended to stop the collapse of the economy and all the economic analysts and the IMF were recommending them I don t remember any major economist recommending an alternative course of action Note also that economic collapse doesn t refer only to the critical period November 2001 February 2002 but to the whole recessive period 1999 2002 and some time before and after We should agree on a phrase that links De la RÃºa s measures with the crisis without falling into any of did not work to stop the economic collapse ended up precipitating the economic collapse ultimately caused the economic collapse were intended to cause the economic collapse had nothing to do with the economic collapse Then the import dependent thing Consider this right after the devaluation neighboring countries had to help us get medicine The public hospital where I worked initially could not get X ray film from the providers and then only by paying in cash and in dollars Argentina then and still now is incapable of sustaining economic growth without importing certain forms of technology I d say that s rather import dependent though we may be speaking of different things What do you propose What s the problem with the religious aspects of the Supreme Justices The previous justices were all old male and ideologically conservative and in addition some had ties to the right wing of the Catholic Church And now two of them are women one is the president of the Court and the other is a militant atheist in her own words The clarification is intended to show the reader that the changes introduced in the Supreme Court were really important Argibay s atheism in particular was even reported as a salient fact in international media In a country where the Church attacks anyone who dares speak of women s rights having these two women at the top of one of the country s government branches is extremely significant The qualification historical for the payment to the IMF is that correct me if I m wrong Argentina had never decided to pay so much to the IMF or anyone else not only at the same time but also ahead of schedule and this payment has re defined the relationship of Argentina with the IMF and swept with many assumptions about the economic future of the country that were valid before the payment I m glad we re discussing this here civilly Understand that no one here is that I know affiliated with a party or a person if someone is it doesn t show and that we don t have an ideological police or a bureaucracy that you have to go through before correcting what you believe is wrong in an article but when an article is not very new and deals with an important topic you have to consider that most of the content is settled already and should be treated carefully to avoid being or being seen as disruptive It s perfectly OK for us to discuss over the tiniest details here Please sign after your comments and replies here using four tildes When you save the page they ll be converted to your username and current date time It s easier to keep track that way,Safe/Neutral

It depends how you define World The war which commenced in 1939 was only between European states while the two most industrially powerful countries on the globe USA and Soviet Union were not at war It only becomes an actual world war in 1941 It could be rationally argued that if the war had ended before 1941 before the USA and SU got involved then it would just have been called the European War or the Great Nazi War or the Anglo Franco German War or something similar It is difficult to see why a war which leaves out the two most powerful countries on Earth could in any real sense be called a world war And I am writing this as a European Still the war has to be called something and once it became a world war in 1941 then the name could retrospectively be applied to the fighting which preceded it,Safe/Neutral

Omg my periods used to be a nightmare I was an angry anxious emotional mess Until I got the Mirena IUD It took about 6 months and then my periods stopped and I only have a little spotting sometimes it s works by keeping the blood from lining in your uterus The best part is it only releases hormones into your uterus and not thru your bloodstream I used to become suicidal on any other birth control I also tried the copper IUD but it made me bleed so bad they had to take it out at the ER,Suicidal Reference

Thanks Curtis that was very supportive and encouraging I m glad I m not as alone as I thought I was I ve had many failed attempts as well I don t know how I ve survived this long either I think about suicide a lot to and I think about how I will end my life I would say I would probelly fantasize it as well at times when I think about it I get jealous of ppl who succeed in committing suicide becuz that could be me I to can t wait for the day I can Rest In Peace and I doubt it will be in this lifetime that s why I feel like suicide is my only option at times Sad but true yes I totally agree I can t wait till I don t have to hurt the way I hurt or feel the terrible deep intense dark feelings that I feel It s a nightmare I also get jealous of those who don t suffer with mental health issues cuz I agree I definitely think it s totally unfair its hard to accept it though I just started working with a new therapist once a week for a hour she s been very nice and is helping me not hold in my feelings and emotions as much and working on my negative thinking and self hate issues I hope it continues to be a helpful and productive therapy for me cuz it s going well so far but I ve only been seeing her for maybe three weeks or so but she s been great and very supportive and she understands my struggles with depression and anxiety I m trying to change my thinking when I get suicidal which is very often my therapist wants to make a pact with her I guess before I hurt myself or attempt suicide I have to reach out but thanks again for the nice message it really made my night and I m feeling better for now It s great to know maybe a few ppl still understand and care about what I m going thru I appreciate it,Suicidal Reference

Suicide is very real for me as well I am a suicidal person I ve had many failed attempts some I don t know how I survived I idealize it on a daily basis I ll run through my head how I m going to do it so that next time it works I fantasize about death and dying When I hear of someone making a attempt and succeeding I get envious and jealous I just long for the day when I ll actually be able to Rest In Peace and not hurt the way I hurt or feel the feelings that I do I also get envious and jealous of people who don t have the struggles of being suicidal because sometimes I think it s not fair but I try and accept it for what it is and I work super close with my therapist once a week to try and change my thinking when I start to go down the suicide road But for the time being I made a pact that I have to be here for my girls dogs because nobody will take care of them the way I do Keep your head up beautiful and know that you are not alone and we are warriors who battle wars most people couldn t fathom fighting and we make it one day at a time It s not a good feeling to be suicidal but it is real and there is support out there we re not alone Keep your chin up hug,Suicidal Reference
Ah ok We didn t have access to music cords can be used for asphyxiation I missed having a support system after I got out I had to fend for myself again in the hospital I just showed up to meals I missed having people that got it we would be genuine in our laughter about our inappropriate jokes about where we were having very frank discussions about what brought us there etc I didn t have to hide anything everything was on the table out in the open Suicide attempts mania hearing voices sex addiction drug abuse Things that were taboo in normal society were normal for us And I still miss that I miss being able to be myself even if it was depressed and scared and ashamed I never put on good graces there I miss being safe It took me about 3 weeks before I felt comfortable being on the outside talking to people And I still wasn t completely assimilated I definitely had to put on the happy face and say that I was doing ok even though I definitely wasn t one week in a hospital doesn t cure you it just gives you a safe place to start to heal I dreaded going out to the mall I just didn t going grocery shopping had to do it running into friends haven t heard from you in a while That s because I was in a psych ward I physically felt like I needed to duck to avoid something I was off work for 6 weeks and it would have been longer but I teach and it was the end of the year and all anyone knew was that I was sick My staff was terrific and only 2 people knew where I was it was the best kept secret EVER in that building 2 people out of 120 I will never be able to re pay that debt But getting back into the regular world was HARD It takes time But it doesn t happen For me 3 days was just scratching the surface of my return into society,Suicidal Reference

Slow down a little Breathe don t panic Understand that your fights effect your mental status Talk yell cry to your therapist Don t jump back in to the frying pan At least for awhile Are you on meds With bipolar and anxiety disorders sounds like you are If not you might want to consider it with your Dr Now some meds can make you feel numb Did for me anyway I too have bipolar and anxiety disorders along with others Been on many many different med combos and have had the numbness Talk with your Dr therapist Let them guide you Have also been in abusive relationships whether it be physical emotional or being abused mentally They all mess with your disorders Clear your head before making any major decision in regards to hooking back up with him Is it worth it You need to take care of YOU Talk to yourself ask yourself questions Answer yourself Yes there will always be good times comforting times but keep in mind the rocky times and again ask yourself if it s worth all that How much can you take But like I suggested talk with your Dr and therapist It helps to get as much input as you can so you can choose what works for you I finally came to the point of saving myself from breakdown And that was after a plan of suicide Good luck to you I hope you get alot of feedback here also You re in my prayers GOD BLESS,Suicidal Reference

My first thought is get to your Dr ASAP and let them know what you are feeling it has been reported that infusions of ketamine will eliminate suicidal thoughts for up to a week dont know if that will work for you but I would ask your obsession is sort of like a seisure not likely to get better on its own wont pretend to know what you are going through but some ssri s can cause these thoughts known in people under 20 yrs old might ask to switch to another ssri my symptom is fear not suicide,Suicidal Reference

Unfortunately there are some idiot therapists Took me years to find the right fit You mustn t give up If you are feeling severe anxiety please go to the emergency ward at the closest hospital Tell that you have had suicidal thoughts and feel overwhelmed and unsafe They will admit you even if it s overnight Usually a psychiatric nurse or doctor will assess you and give you out patient information Stay safe Hugs,Suicidal Reference
Ethan do you have a close friend a relative or a counselor that you can turn to in times of trouble You should likely have a personal safety plan prepared meaning you have someone to go be with when you feel especially depressed vulnerable or suicidal You definitely need to be seeing a doctor for your bipolar disorder if you aren t already It s an illness that needs to be medically treated You definitely can t change that by yourself It s like thinking that if you had cancer or diabetes you could just change it by wanting to or thinking hard enough about it That s not how it works You probably know that bipolar disorder is usually caused by chemical imbalances in the brain You need medications to help with getting your brain chemistry back on a healthy midline for you Your depression is probably causing you to have pervasive thoughts and thought loops just in case you don t know what that is as many people wouldn t that s when you get the same awful negative thoughts and memories playing over and over in your mind You try to get away from them but they often are intrusive and disturbing Depression is BAD about causing those You sound like you might also have a bit of PTSD from being bullied All of those things can be treated well and effectively You need to see a doctor If you are really thinking of running away or doing anything damaging to yourself please seek out help at a hospital There are people who can help you and who will care for you And Ethan I know this may be hard for you to believe right now but you NEVER deserved to be bullied You didn t ask for it The bullies were the ones who were 100 in the wrong and NOT you Please do not take to heart anything they may ve said about you Bullies deliberately try to find something to hurt their victims with Quite often they seem to know exactly where our vulnerabilities and insecurities lie and attack us there Here s the thing they re in the wrong and I m sure the things they said about you were cruel awful and negative I don t know you personally but I do know that no one and I mean this NO ONE deserves to be treated like that Please don t let them keep bullying you even now in your mind Whenever those thoughts and memories come back into your mind try to confront them Try to explain to yourself why those things were incorrect or why those people were wrong about you Rebuild your inner strength by focusing on all the GOOD that I m sure exists in you and all the good you ve done in your life Those bullies didn t know the real you the one deep inside Only you and those closest to you really know you So don t let these bullies and their stupid hatefulness steal another moment of your life from you Please get yourself some help for your bipolar and depression Those can be treated and you might find all those negative thoughts and memories eventually fade with treatment You have only my very best wishes for a better future,Suicidal Reference
I am a recovering self harmer I see it as being like an alcoholic You are never really over it First of all I strongly encourage you to seek out a crisis hotline in your area Please therapy can really help For more immediate relief I used this method and it will sound weird squeeze ice cubes They give a burning sensation which gives you that pain feeling but doesn t have a lasting injury And the actual physical force of squeezing them released tension and stress for me I hope this helps I would also draw what I wanted to cut instead of actually cutting,Suicidal Reference
Hugs I also struggle with self harm and suicidal thoughts I wish I knew how old you are so I could try to help,Suicidal Reference
First off you need to report your boss Nobody and I mean NOBODY in the authoritive position should be using words of profanity much less belittle any employee Go as high up the chain of command until you find someone who will listen and investigate it Record it and send it via email if you have to As for you re seeing a therapist GO I can t stress that enough It s not anyone around you whose life is at jeopardy It s YOURS You need professional help There should be some kind of hotline for crisis you can call on yourself If not go to the emergency room Please do this for yourself Your life matters and you matter Get some help now I am not a cutter but I do understand as I know people who have cut on themselves The feeling of trying to escape from the pain inside only to project that pain on the outside as a means of escape You can message me any time you need to Just get that help you are desperately crying out for before it s too late,Suicidal Reference

I ve dealt with self harming too in more ways than one I purposely bruise myself to relief anger and hate yet at the same time how much hurt I feel for even existing I also deal with more suicidal thoughts more frequently and hell I m only 17 My mum wasn t supportive at first she constantly yelled at me for even the smallest things and my doctor and psychiatrists say that it s just a way of attention seeking and is greedy because it s causing more pain for others than myself I personally feel that no one understand the amount of emotional pain the smallest things effect me My mum only noticed how bad my mental state had gotten when I attempted suicide and kept telling her how much I wanted to die At first she just told me it was teen thing as did the doctors But then I was diagnosed with clinical depression however I feel as if it s more than depression because I have traits of bipolar too I didn t self diagnose myself I know others that are bipolar and they say some of my symptoms are like theirs too Now dear I know it s hard and I m sure many of us have been in your situation before but just know you re not alone in any of this yes people will judge but that shouldn t determine who you really are No one knows you better than yourself Don t let others drag you down and I think your mother should come to some sort of understanding that you re suffering with some mental issues sorry if that comes along rude or anything like that but instead of yelling at you she should comfort you reassure you and so on and not yell In my personal experience after cutting my wrists and thighs I felt terrible guilt and I wanted to stop so badly but didn t want to feel nothing because cutting myself made me feel something I still wanted to stop so what I did was I d get an elastic band or hair band and keep it around my wrist and just ping the hair band elastic band onto my wrist or arm as hard as I could and it may leave a red mark but it won t scar or anything Take deep breathes too 5 seconds inhaling 7 seconds exhaling and continue until you feel okay Crying is also okay to do you re human so it s okay to cry If you feel alone remember you re not alone There are people out there who are just like you whether you know them or not It ll all get better eventually I assure you sweetheart I hope my words have some sort of help for you And I m sorry also if I made it seem all about me I just wanted to show you that you re not alone,Suicidal Reference
Mental illness is so misunderstood by the average person who does not have it or knows anyone close to them who is dealing with it I hope you are talking with a psychatrist or therapist They can put u in touch with the right kind of therapy Sometimes you are the kind of person that can not hold down a job where other ppl are involved with your daily activities If your mental health is taking over all your work time and home time I would suggest you should seek out ssdi or ssi benefits You need more counseling and therapy for yourself You need to work on yourself right now The stress of work is maybe to much right now The psycharist will help explain why u cut and how to get another outlet instead of harming yourself If your work is making you turn to doing this you need to stop going there I know it s easier said then done Try to work on what i said earlier in this post The less stress for you would help alot You cannot change how other ppl perceive you or what they think And thats ok You have to take care of yourself right now You can though remove yourself from these situations where you won t be mocked or where they just don t understand it If u are living with your mom Go to a psycharist at the states financial help Every state has a program for low income If u leave your job I know it will be hard but seems like you need to start with a psycharist Doing what you are doing everyday is not getting u anywhere Try something different by the suggestions i would take Sorry your mother is not more supportive Some ppl are incapable of understanding it sorry to say Even family Hope this helps God Bless,Suicidal Reference

I stopped because I had children and was worried if anyone told it would be possible I might get my babies taken away I have 3 nieces and I have seen the marks on all of them and I feel guilty like I was a bad influence on them I have scars and it is embarrassing for me The best advice I can give is to talk to someone you trust who won t be all judgemental on you Someone who will let you het your emotions out so you don t feel the need to take it out on yourself Therapy really helps too but it seems that may be an issue for you financially Maybe look up a support group for help then Also in therapy they teach you coping methods of things to help you keep from harming yourself Exp journaling listen to music go for a walk do some art work or call a friend Whatever helps you personally Every one is different Good luck to you,Suicidal Reference
I currently struggle with this and have for over 20 years I also think DBT is a great way to go as far as learning new coping skills when you can get the help Personally I have found that drawing on myself with red markers or squeezing ice helps a bit Sometimes if I have old clothes I don t wear anymore I slash or rip them I used to pick up henna kits because it s kind of like making scabs I hope you can get the therapy that will help you There are people who understand though I know it doesn t feel that way right now Depression lies to us that way Oh and a lot of people are posting the hotline which is great but if you re like me and uncomfortable talking in the phone there is a text line 741741 Big hugs and thank you for speaking up and advocating for yourself,Suicidal Reference

NOT everyone has depression Your boss is a twit Depression is an illness That s like saying that everyone has heart disease or diabetes He s an idiot About self harm Quite often self harm is caused by a need to have control in one s own life a feeling of helplessness that combines with depression for a very nasty mix It s time you got some control back 1 This is of the utmost importance Get a new job There s absolutely NO reason to put up with verbal abuse from an employer He should show more professionalism You shouldn t have to put up with it I know it s scary but you ll feel more in control of your life if you start looking for a new job I ve worked a lot in my life and I ve only ever had ONE boss who thought it was okay to cuss her employees First time she did it to me I quit that moment Please don t put up with that crap It s apparent the job doesn t give you insurance so there s no reason for you to be there when you can find something better Maybe your next job shouldn t be as a customer service rep It doesn t seem to be a good fit for you personally especially at this point in your life Look into doing things you d love instead 2 FRIENDS don t just run away when things get rough TRUE friends will do what they can to help you Maybe it s time you assessed the people you have been hanging around You need to find new friends real ones but you can t do that until you get your depression under control 3 Go back to church There has to be like the little volunteer lady or the Pastor or his wife or someone who is known for being compassionate Talk to them If nothing else ask to talk to your pastor for spiritual counseling It s free and it might help you somewhat if nothing else you d have someone to talk to for a bit about what you re feeling 4 Check into local mental health resources that might be available for cheap or free in your area There may be a support group you can join You don t have to be alone Depression is an ILLNESS It is systemic It starts in the mind but it s not long before it takes control of the entire body You need to have it treated like you would if you had pneumonia or diabetes or any other serious illness You d go to the doctor for it If you must go to an ER If there s a charity hospital in your town go to their ER You desperately need to be treated for your depression You might need medications Depression is often caused by chemical imbalances in a person s brain You can t sleep it off It doesn t work that way That d be like telling the person with diabetes a chemical imbalance dealing with the pancreas that they can just sleep it away That s not how any of this works If you take nothing else from my post please remember this Depression is a LIAR It lies to you about your worth your own abilities your life and the people who love you It tells you that no one cares It says that everyone hates you or that they d be better off without you It whispers that you will never be good enough or that you ll never amount to anything or your dreams for your life will never be fulfilled These are LIES It says the same type of things to every sufferer Those lies play like a broken record in your mind You need to get away from them Medication and therapy would do a lot for you If you re cutting a LOT you may need some hospital time It would definitely make people in your life take you more seriously when you say that you re sick Don t kill yourself or anything like that please Keep reaching out There are people who will respond who are willing to be there for you The world is a big place with a lot of wonderful people in it who would help you care for you and be there for you Just keep trying,Suicidal Reference

First of all if your boss is using offensive words you need to go higher Is there a human resources department or a union rep or someone you can confide in That should not ever be something an employee goes through whether you re dealing with your own personal issues or not Do not believe what he said about venting That was entirely uncalled for If you have close friends or a family member or sibling you trust please PLEASE reach out People will surprise you That s one issue I struggle with my partner surprised me when I told him I had an episode this weekend he was genuinely worried and told me to call him next time he s away for work Do you draw or have any extra curriculars artistic talents or other hobbies What about something like ripping paper when you get the urge to cut Have you seen a doctor or psychiatrist counsellor I encourage you to add that to your list it won t solve your problems but having that unbiased person you can talk to may help you make the changes you need Please find the emergency numbers for your area there s several online resources you can even do online counselling if you re worried or not up for face to face I hope you know you are not insignificant You re someone s child friend and so much more The negative thoughts are one voice right now they re just much louder than the positive voice Take care and hugs,Suicidal Reference
