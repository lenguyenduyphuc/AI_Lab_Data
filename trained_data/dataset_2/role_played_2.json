    "input": "Ofc yall can t diagnose me but I m just wondering if this should be something I look into more TW illness possible BPD episodes mental illness I do have childhood trauma My dad suffered from cancer for five years and the last six months were really traumatizing for my family in terms of his illness He did eventually die Also the rest of my family couldn t be emotionally there for me the entire time he was sick So I felt really alone while and even after he died I had really awful episodes of full blown screaming and crying and there were even times I threatened suicide Keep in mind I was only 10 I ve suppressed and depersonalized a lot from my trauma and my therapist is helping me dig it all out I m also working on accepting that it was trauma and that it was bad Well anyways symptoms My therapist says I do have some traits of borderline personality disorder such as impulsively rapidly shifting moods and self harm and suicidal ideation And when I mean fast shifting moods I MEAN FAST Someone could say one thing and doesn t even mean it insultingly and it will cause me to downward spiral into obsessive thoughts and self destructive behavior If it gets bad enough I can also get a panic attack which will cause me to demand my family members to get away from me while I contemplate on self destructive behavior I can also trigger sort of manic episodes if there s just a lot of chaos good chaos going around or if I m just feeling good Lots of sugar and caffeine can also cause this In terms of abandonment issues they re pretty mild if even there at all Like if I have a fight with my friends which can get pretty out of control on my end I can get paranoid that they ll never want to talk to me again Or even if I say something I can start this I ll just become convinced that they hate me and don t want to talk to me anymore Mainly because I feel bad but I don t know I guess this could also fall under the category of unstable relationships which was a big problem after my dad died I also have kind of an unstable view of myself Like one day I could like myself and the next hate myself and fall into feelings of self loathing I also have ongoing feelings of emptiness but I feel like that could be more from emotional suppression to dissassociation I think my therapist doesn t really know if I ll develop borderline because I m only 15 and not an adult and I think she said that we ll just see how my personality continues to develop But I wanted to ask you all anyways Not if I have it just if I should look into it more",

    "input": "Trigger warnings for mentions of rape suicide miscarriage drug and alcohol Ive tried to keep it as brief and vague as pos This post is going to be rambly and a bit all over the place so sorry in advance Also sorry for the grammar and spelling errors I Äôm looking for advice and guidance please Hi I was diagnosed with bpd 3 years ago Theres been a lot of trauma in throughout my life and the past year or so I finally started to feel more stable which was ace Until recently i cant pinpoint when things started slipping up again but today theres been a kind of explosion of all my built up emotions and I took it out on someone who didn Äôt deserve it at all I Äôm not trying to justify my actions but i think a bit of background would be useful Growing up i was an awful child i was always angry and i never knew why but used to have physical outburst at my parents It was only towards them and I don Äôt know why it was at them and why i was Äògood Äô around others I never wanted to hurt them but i couldn Äôt stop This lead to me eventually going into foster care as my parents couldn Äôt cope but it also wasn Äôt a healthy environment for my siblings I don Äôt blame them for that decision It still hurt Now looking back i can see how incredibly damaging i was to their mental health but i still cant help but feel hurt A lot of their time was taken up with my outbursts and i never got any quality time with them as a result the rest of their time was spent with my siblings Rationally i know they spent time with me because of my outburst but it annoys me because i didn Äôt get that quality time like my siblings Its frustrating as i know rationally that was okay but the other part of my brain has always told me they don Äôt like you they didn Äôt want you thats why you got sent away they only speak to you cause they feel bad The rational side of my brain is constantly at battle with the other side of my brain and its draining How do you get it to stop In foster care i got in with the wrong crowd drugs alcohol unhealthy relationships ect I was also moved foster placements over 15 times as i was too much for people to handle I had Äòfriends Äô use me and steal from me and then death threats when i called them out on it I was raped by another foster kid who at the time i was in a relationship with Has a miscarriage I had episodes of psychosis from drug abuse I ended up in and out of psych wards too for attempts In one of the hospitals a close friend committed on the ward In one of my foster placements i was neglected and there was an investigation into ss which found multiple failings This isnt for sympathy I have felt so done over by people I blame myself alot like if i could control my anger i would have still been at home and none of that would have happened or if i kept my head down and stayed away from the drugs and alcohol alot could have been avoided ect But i also see the bad in everyone I think everyone is out to get me Or how long before that friend wants to hurt me Or how long before that family member decided to cut me me off I have such a fear of being hurt by people that I struggle to go out alone I go on walks by myself to areas where theres not people but everywhere else i have a carer which is usually my mum I moved county to get away from all the stuff from where i used to live and to be close to my mum for support For a while that was going great But then she started to take a step back because she couldn Äôt commit to helping anymore It annoyed me as i moved the the county she was in aa she said shed support me and it seemed to have all been for nothing I could Äôve moved to a few other county Äôs where other friends and family had offered to support It took me back to the feelings i had when i was a child of being too much and unwanted I kept it to myself for a while but we were arguing more and more over the smallest of things Until today when we had another argument and she said she wasn Äôt going to the concert i brought us tickets for and to ask my dad I was so hurt the kind of hurt where u can feel it in every fibre of your body I went to hers to try and talk and i know I shouldn Äôt of She asked me to leave and thats she didn Äôt want to talk Every rejection felt like another knife pushed into me and twisted I wanted her to know how i felt and i knew shed be annoyed if i didn Äôt leave and thats the closest shed get to hurting like i was She said if i didn Äôt leave we were done As i was sat refusing to leave i was thinking to myself just go home this is going to make things worse why do you want her to hurt Your sick But i couldn Äôt I can Äôt explain why She said if i go we will talk on Friday as i said if i leave theres no point as you wont speak to me anyway She drives me home but then I Äôm thinking she just said that to lake me leave Its like im a shell and im being controlled like a puppet Im refusing to leave the car again Eventually i leave but again i don Äôt know why i left just like i don Äôt know why i refused to leave I remember everything but its like it wasn Äôt me My anger my distrust my feelings of rejection are starting to rule my life again I had this under control for so long but its like a screw has come loose and now everything is back to how it was when i was younger I don Äôt want to be like this So i guess I Äôm asking for help on how to stop all of this again I currently have a referral for the mh team in place but i need something sort term for now",

    "input": "I know this is long and no one will read this but I really need to write about it somewhere I ve never been active on this sub but i ve been struggling with BPD for a while diagnosed for around two years as well as eating disorders my whole life and anxiety and depression for the last five I F24 broke up with my FP M25 last Monday I didn Äôt realize he was my FP until after I broke it off The truth is that for the past three months since i met him he was the focus of my entire life Everything I did was around him and 100 of my emotions depended on him going from euphoric to extremely depressed in a mater of seconds depending or not in wether i got a text from him or wether or not he wanted to see me There was never a problem when we were physically together but once we were apart my anxiety kicked in and I became super paranoid and jealous and obsessive I never showed any of these traits towards him I would never double text or call him twice or express jealousy etc I would only ask for constant validation for example Äútell me i Äôm pretty do you like me do you like spending time with me etc especially during sex which i knew he thought was weird I never told him anything about my anxiety or my extreme emotions so instead I would just let my life fall apart and cry myself to sleep He wasn Äôt my boyfriend it was a romantic situation initiated by him after meeting him during a weekend getaway with a group of mutual friends He was all in at the start but eventually the situation transitioned into FWB because he couldn Äôt Äúoffer me a relationship Äù i think that was the exact moment I started obsessing I pretended to be fine with it cause I wasn t willing to let go however for me at least it never stopped being romantic It wasn Äôt just about sex we would go on dates and talk every day and hang out to do other stuff We talked about everything and never stopped being exclusive A lot of the things he said and did made me think he wanted more but looking back i was probably overly attached and delusional or just confused He wasn t a bad person He always told me exactly what he wanted on a verbal level i just believe he started to like me too at some point and started doing and saying things not deemed casual which was confusing to me Obviously it ended badly because his emotional unavailability led to him being inconsistent somedays he would be the nicest most into me person treat me amazing and then the next day he would take ten hours to respond a text and bail on me last minute for his friends or family The highs were AMAZING but the lows were unbearable and they were becoming more and more frequent I decided to end it because it was clear to me that i wanted more and he wasn t sure and it was really triggering for my BPD My anxiety and depression were and still are worse than ever i had to increase my dosage of antidepressants and i got back into old ED habits these past months becoming severely underweight I Äôm usually emotionally dependent on my romantic relationships but they tend to be way more short lived and not as deep as this I think it Äôs the first time I develop a romantic FP i m actually not sure i ve ever had an FP though looking back i ve had some very toxic and dependent friendships in the past I went to the psychiatrist last Wednesday and he upped my dose of SRRIs and told me he thinks my BPD is worse than ever Him and my friends and family are really worried about my weight and I am now being constantly observed and pressured towards eating The thought of eating makes me sick and the thought of gaining back the weight i put off scares me to death Everyone thinks that anorexia is the biggest of my problems because it s physically dangerous but no one was worried when I used to binge eat and was a couple of pounds overweight All that worries me is how depressed I am I see no way out of this I broke it off kind of abruptly because i thought it would be better to feel sad for a while than perpetually anxious On the day it happened I acted impulsively and just lashed out on him after sex i didn t want to have sex in the first place and felt no pressure on his behalf just kind of felt this impulse i said some horrible things I told him i didn t want him in my life anyway because he s a drug addict with daddy issues and no ambitions whatsoever in life and then i told him the only reason i ever liked him was because he was fucked up in the head and that was just my type I made it seem like I wasn t interested in anything serious a lie just tired of the way he was treating me but I acted very aggressively and used intimate things he had told me to actually hurt him I was fine the day after i really hated him and never wanted to see him again I obviously then regretted everything i said and this past week i ve been feeling like dying I think about him all the time from the minute i get up to the moment I go to bed I m constantly checking on him on social media and creating fake scenarios in my head that he ll suddenly call me and tell me he misses me and wants to be with me romantically Even if this happened I know that no amount of attention will ever be enough for me not to feel anxious and insecure extremely fearful of anyone walking out on me It s all I think about I can t work I can t sleep I can t lead conversations with others I keep thinking of things I could ve done differently to get him to love me maybe if I hadn t said this or that or acted differently this one time or been skinnier I keep imagining how he hates me based on that last encounter and never wants to see me again What scares me the most is that I felt so much for him and I m scared that he had absolutely no feelings towards me ever and was just using me for his ego This is going to sound horrible but I d rather know that I really hurt him and have him hate me because it s the only way i d know that he cared at some point I know it was stupid to put myself in a situation like this considering my history of mental health I m a really social person and have a LOT of friends and not in the superficial way I actually feel a close connection to a lot of people I know people with BPD don t tend to have long lasting stable relationships and even though for me it s always been true romantically and family wise I make friends really easily and for the most part develop healthy long lasting relationships Lately I ve been receiving so much love All my friends knew about my FP situation most of them met him and saw us together Even though most of them don t know I have BPD just my family it s not because i m embarrassed or anything I just don t want people labeling me and acting differently they know i m extremely emotional and impulsive and know about my underlying mental health disorders They know how hard this break up was on me and are all constantly checking in on me texting me sending me memes and playlists asking me to hang out They listen to me give me feedback my male friends tell me the nicest things to lift my ego not in a creepy way I even feel overwhelmed because knowing about my ED my friends are constantly buying me food because they believe this situation will trigger me already did I know I should feel so loved my family has been the same Super supportive even though we ve been going through rough patches lately Still I can t help but isolate because it seems to me like none of this matters if I don t have FP I feel like no one understands like my friends all think they get it but no one feels heartbreak like people with this mental disorder were you literally feel like your mind is playing tricks on you and you just go through life floating around trying to get over someone I feel like a could trade fifty people who are giving me unconditional love just for the slightest attention from this one person I don t think i ll ever be able to have a relationship with anyone I can t let any relationship develop naturally because I always need more than ANYONE can offer I always bail before I get really hurt but then end up regretting it and more hurt than before I also always tend to go for people who are emotionally unavailable and have never been capable of liking anyone who is actually interested in me I don t know what the point of posting this was i just really needed to write it all down even if no one reads this If anyone does please give me advice on how you ve gotten over past FPs without necessarily finding a new one I d really like to heal by myself and not be emotionally dependent on anyone like this ever again",

    "input": "Lately I ve been feeling like my bf doesn t love me anymore But I don t know if it s rational or if it s my BPD and I m just feeling things more intensely I m worried it could be my BPD getting worse again because I was doing really well right apart from social anxiety but then I stopped taking Topiramate for my migraines which I d been taking for 6months ish and I also got my contraceptive implant removed So I m worried that either of those things could be fucking my emotions and making me feel things more intensely Why I ve been feeling like he doesn t love me anymore sometimes we just sit in silence next to eachother on the sofa but not really with eachother I ll try and talk to him but he ll just give me short answers and not try and carry on the conversation I ve asked him if he s ok when this happens and he always says he s fine or just tired we haven t been having sex very regularly for a while It s been at least 3 months since we had a regular sex life and since I ve orgasmed please kmn This was partially down to me because my hormones were fucked from the contraception and I had 0 sex drive But it s been back to normal for a few weeks now and our sex life hasn t really gotten any better I ve initiated a few times and a couple times we have had sex but it hasn t really gone great but he barely initiates at all so I m worried he doesn t really want to have sex with me this probably sounds silly but often we ll be sat on the sofa together and he will just randomly say he s going up to bed and give me a kiss and then go upstairs It really makes me feel like he doesn t care because he doesn t ask if I m coming to bed with him or encourage me not to stay up too late I always do this when I decide I want to go to bed first It makes me think he doesn t want to sleep next to me I m worried this is irrational but it really really bothers me even though I know it sounds silly I don t feel like we re excited to see eachother or do thing with eachother any more For context we ve been living together for 2 years now and we both work from home Any advice would be really appreciated here I just don t know if I m feeling things too intensely or if my hormones are fucking with me head üôÉ",

effect it had on me and my relationship with family and friends I stuck with her because I loved her and knew that it wasn Äôt her fault And when she got off it eight months ago it also took me some time to adjust Anyways after we broke up we decided to take a break but stay committed to one another because we knew that the thing that could hurt us the most was seeing one of us being with someone else In all honesty things went pretty well after we broke up We started communicating and seeing each other often again We were happier Her and I were both recovering from the depressive states from BC During these times though she didn Äôt want her friends knowing about us continuing to talk because of her friends judgements I know how her sister gets on her often so I understood and was just committed to improving our relationship from the BC fallout we had At the same time though she wanted me to take her out on dates post her and buy her flowers which confused me a bit In all honesty I always wanted to do those things but I was a broke college student on the verge of graduation with an amazing job opportunity lined up Anyways as we get closer to graduation I start asking if we could become official again because I wanted to have her around my family at graduation She even admitted that she didn Äôt understand why were weren Äôt together since we were so much better and happier This was only a day before the event About four months ago a day before my graduation I went through one of the most traumatic experiences of my life One of my partners friends was graduating so they had been celebrating and drinking throughout the weekend Usually I would be invited to go out with her but since it wasn Äôt my celebration and just the girls I understood Plus her friends and sister still didn Äôt know the extent of us still together and talking The only thing I had ask for was her letting me know when she got home safely like we Äôve always done with one another That night I woke up at 3 4am randomly and realized I never got a text so I called and ask if she was okay She sounded different and extremely drunk so I came over to check on her She seemed completely different another person and the drunkest I Äôve seen her in our 3 year relationship I asked what happened and as she taking off her makeup she says ÄúI hung out with another guy Äù My heart dropped I asked her what she meant and she cold heartedly repeated it I then asked if she slept with him to which she replied yes I broke down I couldn Äôt believe it and just asked why To which she responded ÄúHe made me feel wanted Äù She started blaming me saying that this random guy took videos of her posted her and made her feel wanted This messed with me so badly because she told me that she didn Äôt want her friends knowing about us It didn Äôt made sense to me she had also started her period as well and I know how uncomfortable she is about that Out of confusion I called her sister and asked about it to which she responded by bashing me and saying that she could do whatever she wants because she Äôs single Her sister and friend didn Äôt know how her and I were on the verge on getting back together and it took me a second to realize I only traumatized myself more by seeing the bloody condoms in the bathroom and on her bed sheets I felt like I was in a nightmare like I was going mad I really felt my sanity mental state break And as I Äôm broken she drunkenly starts falling asleep and calming down She grabs me tells me to hold her and tell me she loves me That Äôs the girl I fell in love with I laid there awake for the next couple of hours in the bed where it all happened thinking about how it happened with a shattered mind she told me she doesn Äôt remember any of it It never felt like I graduated and I was depressed for the next 2 weeks I stayed in bed almost all day and rarely ate Since then I Äôve been waking up or have panic attacks around 3am experience episodes of amnesia depersonalization derealization and suicidal thoughts I loved her so we tried to work things out and I invited her to move in with me while I work She moved in with me shortly afterwards for the summer and for the most part I was okay with her there with me But as soon as she left to go back to school the symptoms got worse The evening after work I came back to my apartment and realized she wasn Äôt there anymore I immediately broke down and almost went through a 3 day period of derealization The 2nd evening I had downloaded tinder but didn Äôt create a profile The following morning when I was having a panic attack related to that night I had actually created a profile that was the first time I had experienced a depersonalization episode so vividly I didn Äôt remember making it I just remember feeling insecure lonely and sad as I watched myself on the phone for a couple of seconds It felt like a dream and I don Äôt even remember falling back to sleep afterwards I just woke up for work and it wasn Äôt until later in the day I realized I created an active profile when I got a notification that someone liked my profile I was so embarrassed and deleted it right after work since I was busy leading work that day Of course one of her friends found out and told her about it It was only active for a couple of hours and I wasn Äôt active on it so I thought nothing could Äôve happened I explained to her what I had experienced and that I didn Äôt remember making it but she didn Äôt believe me It was the first time I thought to myself that I wasn Äôt mentally right She broke up with me afterwards but we kept talking for the next 2 weeks and I thought she started believing me It wasn Äôt until the day when we had made plans to go out for dinner that she cancelled on me and suddenly told me to stop talking to her This triggered an episode where I tried to OD on my ADHD medicine I don Äôt even remember taking them or how much Thankfully I was okay since it was a lower dosage just stayed up until the next morning At that time I didn Äôt know what I had until I called my best friend after the suicidal episode and told him about my experiences that he said that I should get checked out for BPD as he had it 2 years earlier and he said it sounded similar It makes sense to me since I thought I was going crazy I had never done this before in my entire life I haven Äôt been the same since that night thoughts",

    "input": "Hello everyone I want to talk about my ex who is diagnosed with BPD We have broken up and they ve discarded me for 8 times now but they usually come back in a few days It have been very emotionally taxing for me so the last time they discarded me I told them that I dont want this relationship anymore and they cant come back to me again like they used to They said they wouldn t and that was the end of our conversation One month later now I saw that they hit a new milestone in their career and I was really proud of them for achieving it so I reached out and congratulated them I ve been warm but distant They talked about how much they missed me Ngl I did too Losing them was like losing your lover and bestfriend at the same time So I told them that I did too Am I leading them on If yes then how can i not do it and still be warm towards them We always had a natural ease at conversation which still exists and I think they like talking to me and I dont mind a platonic relationship either but they are usually an all or nothing kind of person Also I m getting the feeling that they want this relationship back How can i politely set boundaries I know if I say I want to be friends they ll say no and not talk to me and then come back to me after harming themselves or indulging in alcohol one night stands I know I m good at comforting them when needed and they genuinely don t have any real friends I dont mind being that for them if only they let me We haven t talked about the last discard and how much they hurt my feelings that day I think I ll avoid talking about it because I ve forgiven them and moved on I would have tried a relationship but I m going through emotional trauma of losing a loved one myself and I m not very stable to be a favourite person It s extremely hard to deal with constant push and pull and listen to their bitter words They have recently started therapy so hopefully things will get better but I cant be in a relationship with them for now at least How to make them understand all this Whenever I say just friends they run away and self sabotage I dont want that to happen So I take them back again It s a bad cycle I don t want to repeat it",

    "input": "hello sorry for the length so for non triggering context my father used to hit my brother older and i when we were kids sometimes it Äôd be just spanking but more times it was with a belt i don Äôt remember a lot about it but i do remember hearing my brother scream and cry and i still have nightmares about it to this day im 18 now this probably happened from 3 7 idk for sure so when i got diagnosed borderline last year and read up on it i obviously saw that the causes are generally genetics brain chemistry and environment so i kind of just assumed that my bpd is because of how he treated us but in my last two therapy sessions we talked about the trauma in detail for the first time in a few years and i stated that i must have been a terrible child to make him want to hurt me so bad my therapist also pointed out that my splitting is likely a result of my fathers inconsistency because some days i Äôd come home to tea parties and other days i Äôd come home to bruises however like two days after the session my father told me that he was proud of me and that i am a good kid and i always have been and how he doesn Äôt get to say it to me much because i Äôm not usually home the spiral that this caused was impressively horrible because he pretty much just confirmed that he hit us for no reason and therefore took away any chance i had at growing up normal and he recently started going back to therapy he Äôs been sober and clean for 27 years and is trying to work on himself but i don Äôt know how to process this anger while living in the same house with him i know i should give him the same patience and understanding that everyone deserves when you start therapy because we are all a work in progress but at the same time i want to curse him out and make him suffer as much as i have over the years to avenge little me what i really want is to make peace with the fact that i am not the reason i turned out this way and that i didn Äôt do anything to deserve what i got but my brain keeps on focusing on the fact that my life could have been so much less painful if i didn Äôt turn out borderline because of how he treated me i know this community is fairly traumatized unfortunately so i guess i just want to hear what others have done if they Äôve been in a similar situation or just any advice because i do not know how to handle anger without SH and i do not want to throw away my 9 months clean",

pressure on me He wanted me to be top of my class at mathematics and would make me sit with him at the computer for long periods of time which I struggled with I believe he tried his hardest but I have some hidden memories of him yelling at me and spanking me I absolutely hate saying this word out loud due to the embarassment It wasn t all bad and it would be unfair if I did not mention the fond memories I had at his computer playing those old browser Scooby Doo games This is the reason I have such a love for video games today Sadly he never saw it as a good thing When I misbehaved he would threaten to smash my Xbox which terrified me It was my favourite thing in the world and it felt like he wanted to take that away He would often compare me to my friend who he feared was smarter despite her being a year younger On a ridiculous occasion he made us BOTH do a maths test when we just wanted to hang out I mean I was 9 Traumatic memories I believe I blocked out some of these or just forgot I never told this to anyone not even my therapist or psychiatrist I might show this post to my therapist next time if I feel comfortable doing so It s the best thing about internet anonymity Due to my autism undiagnosed until I was 6 I had a sensory hair pulling thing I was on his shoulders and pulling his hair kinda like that scene in Ratatouille lol I had no idea it hurt him and I was only around 5 It was not my intention at all He went into a rage and threw me to the ground which caused an empty beer bottle to smash Thankfully the glass never hurt me but I was so confused scared and shocked Since I had angered him and it was not like he did it for the sake of it my Mum was not mad I was blamed and maybe it was my fault who knows Either way it shook me We were on the computer together and I was bobbing my head about which I believe may have angered him either because it hit his face or because I wasn t paying attention Anyway I blocked the memory of the entire event but I remember suddenly being on the ground with him screaming roll over so he could spank me I think Oddly I cannot look at the brand Rollover hotdog UK crappy brand without hearing those words I used to fight a lot with the neighbour kid We were friends but I admit I was a bit of a bully which I am ashamed of I had no concept of boundaries and I do not want to blame my autism ADHD for this but I think I got mad and shoved her and she had to go home crying My Dad was oddly more angry with me than the girl s parents were He didn t speak tome for days and one day threatened to punish me if I ever did it again I was cheeky back not sure why He must have carried to my room but I don t remember that part Next thing I know he enters my room with a belt I was fcking 6 YEARS OLD I must have known what it was for so I pleaded with him not to use it The dog was there too Luckily he didn t It scared the shit out of me I was never beaten or anything but he did hit me on a few other occasions Nothing sore but for stupid stuff like me not wanting to go to the park with him I think he once pushed me into a bush next to stingy nettles He would make frequent comments jokes or angry insults about me being chunky I was NEVER overweight which makes no sense He has hit me a few times but it was usually for me being rude to him Teen years now Mentally I was healthy until I became depressed at 13 I ended up going to CAMHS youth mental health service for kids up to 18 I began to self harm and had a lot of suicidal thoughts I HATED my Dad and I knew deep down it was because of how he used to treat me I never mentioned this to CAMHS because I was so embarrassed I am so embarrassed by spanking I ended up developing some kind of spanking fetish I will never ever mention this to anyone and I believe it was because of the occasions Oddly I know I WAS spanked but I don t remember the actual process or if it hurt or not or left any marks I was a perfect quiet student at school This probably stems from my Dad wanting me to be perfect CAMHS did not know why I had these mood swings The self harm usually happened after arguing with my Dad I would go nuts when he was there I even reached for a knife once I would never have used it but I had these awful dark fantasies every day at school At 14 I was diagnosed with OCD awful illness but unrelated to my BPD or childhood My Mum was heartbroken because me and my Dad used to get on well At 15 things settled for a bit until I reached 16 A younger girl in my school died by suicide It was never mentioned in order to protect us but we all knew I never knew her but for some reason this made me extremely unwell within a day At first I felt numb I didn t want to go to school I was terrified of the tragedy being mentioned and I became extremely anxious every morning incase another death would be mentioned I began to attempt suicide First was a heart hearted wrist cut Then I began trying to hang myself but I was young and it never seemed to work The worst occasion was when I locked myself in the bathroom trying to do it properly My Dad was furious I undid the noose and still refused to leave I was crazy and laughed in his face when he threatened to call the police on me I was 16 and thought that the police only came for crimes He kicked down the door hit me and my nose started bleeding everywhere Tried to run away after fighting with him went to the hospital with my Mum with my nightdress covered in blood could taste the metal in my mouth My Dad took away my games consoles as punishment I told the docs EXACTLY how my nose broke They checked my nose was not broken and discharged me after a crappy pscyh eval Social work was contacted but did nothing To this day I regret not calling the police on my Dad I think I have a slight scar on my nose but its not very visible Following this I had a few other visits like getting stiched up for sh CAMHS had no idea what was causing this and put it down to an unlabeled undiagnosed mood disorder I was put on fluoxotine which did not help one bit I went to university and then dropped out and had the worst mental breakdown of my life 4 hospital admissions in 2021 alone Doc took me off my fluoxotine and gave me nothing else Eventually I was tried on a pathetically low dose of quetiapine Came off it and went all paranoid thinking my house was haunted Took an OD and was in the hospital on a drip for days admitted to psych ward and put on a high dose of setraline for OCD and a small dose or risperidone From Dec 2021 to Nov 2022 I stayed out of hospital I was using other substances like weed edibles and psychedelics I had the worst psychotic experience from the weed but it was an addiction to me Normal people feel calm maybe a bit paranoid For me I heard screaming voices telling me to kms I quit all cold turkey as I was worried about my psychosis getting worse I had an assessment done with a private psych for ADHD and was prescribed concerta It helped a TON Issue is due to my BPD making me more prone to psychosis I ended up hallucinating I quit setraline as my OCD was becoming worse and started escitalopram only SSRI that has ever helped with my symptoms Within days I began talking really fast running around making insane FaceBook comments on a BPD form and accusing people of laughing at me just for reacting with the laugh emoji I was enraged and began to self harm and post with blood I reached out for help months before this as I began craving the urge to put blood all over myself I had homicidal thoughts which terrified me I knew that I would never act on them but I wanted to kill myself as I had the delusion that there was another person controlling me I was admitted to the psych ward and due to past experiences I was terrified I attempted to run away and strange myself but a lovely nurse calmed me down Was the 2 week stay perfect absolutely not But I am now the most stable I have ever been It saved my life I was prescribed a REASONABLE dose of seroquel quetiapine now on around 100mg 125mg may go higher I was paranoid about the nurses secretly wanting me to kill myself and everything they said I analysed as an attack on me The concerta gave me some kind of stimulant psychosis where I felt like I was in two different realities Even being on a lowish moderate dose has taken those hallucinations away The escitalopram lexapro still makes me energetic euphoric jumpy but the quetiapine calms it down a lot For the first time in ages I feel like I want to live I gave up hope My message is to NEVER give up hope If your doctor isn t listening keep trying and trying You deserve to be happy and healthy no med will help BPD is harmful and negative Yes therapy is amazing I used to think that BPD was the worst thing ever because no meds can help I can t engage in therapy because my brain chemicals are screwed up blah blah blah No All bad stories have a happy ending Whilst I blame my Dad for these struggles I have not let it ruin my life I am grateful my attempts on my life failed I hold no resentment to him anymore although I cannot be in the same room as him I just avoid him and do what I love doing amp x200B Peace and love",

    "input": "My therapist allowed email contact in between sessions as his sessions are not always regular due to disruptions in his my schedule I ve emailed him many times in the past and he always replies back within a few days We ve spoken about this in person about the boundaries regarding emailing etc I always start off my emails by telling him that he doesn t have to reply This is something I ve said to him in person as well that I don t need a proper response that all I m really asking when I email is are you still here and a one or two word reply is all I need The past few months have been extremely difficult due to several things that happened all at the same time He knows I ve been struggling I ve also been having exams during this period I m still in the midst of exams The things that have happened messed up my concentration massively and I ve been struggling with trying to study Anyway I didn t have therapy last week and I emailed my therapist as I was having a very difficult time I was basically having suicidal thoughts losing hope and feeling like a failure It was a difficult email to send as I struggle with opening up to people and the email included a lot of painful content It s been 9 days since I sent that email my therapist still has not replied to it I know that maybe it was because I told him he didn t need to reply He knows what I meant by that we have talked about this in person and he always replies to emails regardless But I figured maybe he had other reasons too I ve tried to rationalise it I ve told myself that there could be many reasons why he had not replied He could have been dealing with emergency situations and just didn t have the time He could have forgotten or just not seen it Or something else So I sent him another follow up email 2 days ago to express my distress at his lack of reply and to ask him if there s a reason he didn t reply I told him that all I needed was one short sentence to know that he had received my email He still has not replied Even if he had reasons for not replying to the first email I don t know how to rationalise why he ignored my second email as well All I was asking was one sentence That s all Even if he didn t want to discuss it he could ve told me that we should talk about in the therapy session Unless his email was hacked and he didn t receive the email I honestly cannot understand why he would ignore my second email as well I was very explicit about how distressing a lack of reply had been Being ignored is my biggest trigger there s nothing that causes me to go into meltdown mode faster than that Not only does my mind run wild it makes me feel like I don t exist like I ve been annihilated in some way I have a session with him tomorrow that I have now cancelled as I don t want to see him again He feels deeply punitive to me now I know I m splitting on him but I honestly cannot hold onto any image of him as a good therapist I m so disappointed and betrayed by what he did I only have a few more exams left I really needed to concentrate and my concentration has already been racked by the other things that have been happening but what he did it made me collapse completely I have not been able to focus at all and I m going to mess up my exams I resent him for this I know I shouldn t blame him but if I had known that he was going to be a source of pain I would have never emailed him especially in the midst of exams I think I m also withdrawing from him completely now because I feel like I lost all power all control with him Even if he did have a good reason for not replying I don t ever want to feel so vulnerable and pathetic ever again I don t know if anyone can relate to this but it felt like my life stopped while I was waiting for his email I would look at my phone over and over again willing for the email notification to pop up I didn t want to get out of bed I became even more depressed as the days passed and he didn t reply It was as though I needed a reply so I could breathe again and function again It became almost obsessive I was refreshing my email over and over again I couldn t focus on anything else My mind was going crazy from having panic attacks at the thought that maybe he had died to feeling hated and rejected and ashamed for the contents of the email to feeling resentful that he had robbed me of what little concentration I had left I don t want anyone to matter this way ever again I ve experienced this in my romantic relationships as well and I hated being so dependent on someone else in this manner Whenever I had arguments with boyfriends my world would collapse completely and I wouldn t be able to function at all This is one reason why I have to stop therapy I m just done I can t trust him anymore and I don t ever want anyone to have this sort of power over my life again Do therapists just not understand how it feels for patients clients when we email them I asked him once how he responds if a patient gets triggered and sends multiple emails or something he laughed and nonchalantly said that he just ignores them If he doesn t want to reply to emails he just ignores them His nonchalance bothered me even then Because somehow he didn t seem to understand how hurtful it can be especially if there is no warning",

    "input": "My bf mid 20s is breaking up with me same age He spent a year and a half telling I was his light and everything to him and we built this whole future And he really is the sweetest person I ever met I was diagonsed with bpd when I was around 17 but my psychologist at the time didnt want to tag me with it I had 2 more psychiatrist say the same thing so I for sure have the quiet type my mom has bpd too and Ive seen her break downs and splits and her violence and paranoia I would never lift a finger at another person much less yell much less say mean things It would make me cry and scare ME I just lived in a very chaotic household and learnt first hand what is like to be bpd with all the violence and clinging to what hurts you I have been terrified of relationships ever since I used to run around hiding scissors and knives and pills when I was 8 My mom would hold my face and say promise me to never fall in love She did worse things but I wont mention them I dont get angry I get extremely sad and desperate All in all I am pretty calm but if I feel uncared for Ill instantly sh Ive been doing it since I have memory honestly And cutting is the only coping mechanism I actually have since I was 12 Anxiety depression eating disorder and self harm Nice package Mix in my family always telling me my reality was wrong so I doubt everything and ohhh gosh I realise how hard it is for someone to be with me So I am really honest and cautious and dont expect them to know everything and honestly consoling me is soo easy if you hug me or stroke me Ill instantly start feeling better I started texting this boy long distance We lived together 3 months And now we re back to long distance Everything was so incredible And I told him everything from the start Throughout our relationship we were so in love and he was so thorough about loving me He made some pretty bad mistakes I didnt hold it against him but it did make me incredibly insecure and so I wanted to talk about things so I dont explode He told me this felt like a cycle like he did everything wrong whilst thinking he wasnt That I get sad and get him too sad I told him it WAS a cycle and I was trying to see how to cope with it and I re assured him mentioning all the things he did right I came to him with an insecurity and he didnt help at all He ended up breaking up with me Because he says he feels like a terrible person for what he did it was pretty bad but I thought talking about things from a place of love would help But at the same time saying I am bringing him down and just didnt feel like loving me right now Yet 4 weeks ago he was telling me he loves me and I am the happiest he has ever been and couldnt wait to watch anime and go on walks and do nice things together forever We got back together 2 weeks ago but it feels like we ve been breaking up for 4 weeks and it is killing me My brain is driving me to 10 differeny destinations all day Break up love him ask him to come ask him to go My splits are internal and I try so hard I swear I NEVER get angry I want people to have peace like I want i always tell them they can ask me anything that mistakes get solved or we learn and anything is talkable But apparently I am so sad he feels like he is walking around egg shells which really hurt because it is the opposite I always convey I have been trying to not get paranoid to not let this period in time make me make rash decisions or block him or anything I truly love him But he is killing me right now and gives absolutely no fucks about it I feel like I am so difficult no one will ever care or love me And I dont understand I really am not a bad person I am just sad And people keep hating me for it I dont understand anything I dont trust my reality or my thoughts I dont trust him wanting to break up either but I dont know what to do I dont like monetary love I love the sun and dogs and parks and walks To bring me down from being sad someone could just give me strokies I dont understand how people keep on having such a difficult time loving me I know there is something wrong with me yet I wonder if and what that even is I planned my suicide a long time ago If he breaks up with me I will do it in a year or so so he doesnt think it was because of him which Im not I wont do it because of him And it isnt because I cant live without relationships I knew that as a very obsessive person it was incredibly important for me to have lovely things beside my relationship and not to toot my own horn here but Iam very proud of myself for doing that I watched so many people fall like that into their relationships I am so in love and hurting yes but I am just really tired and really hurt I dont understand anything and I am just exhausted I have always been I have been told I am so fucked up all my life My family and now my boyfriend too I feel it too I dont feel like fighting my brain for the rest of my life I truly dont understand why I cant choose to not be here I know it wont end I am just very ready to go",

    "input": "I Äôve held on for all of these years in hopes that either my efforts to better myself would eventually pay off or things would magically get better But something happened recently to where I realized that there is no getting better at least for me My life has been the same never ending cycle of misery since I was 12 Constant manic highs and lows full of hope to complete hopelessness but mostly hopeless lows And I can Äôt seem to help but to hurt anyone I get close to Nobody cares and for good reason I am not a good person I can Äôt keep living thru this same cycle over and over again anymore and I Äôve finally realized that the only way to break it for good is to take myself out of the equation entirely I can Äôt handle the sadness anger and jealously anymore To keep having my hope ripped out from under me by myself And I can Äôt keep watching the people I love the most more than I could ever love myself suffering because of me They would be so much better off without me even if they don Äôt realize it I resent the fact that I was even born at all because there has never been anything good enough to justify all of the suffering hopelessness loneliness and guilt I don Äôt even know what Äôs right or wrong anymore just that everything that I do is the wrong thing I hate this life and it Äôs never going to get any better and I have unintentionally done irreparable harm to those I love and now my only attachment to them forever will be the pain I brought on them I want to carve up my arms until I bleed so much that I faint I want to punch my head through a wall and give myself a concussion I want to get a gun and blow my brains out and let my body fall back into the ocean so at least my useless corpse can feed the marine life and maybe for once my final act on this planet will do some good rather than harm Why even allow me to be born I don Äôt want to live this human experience it was not made for me I don Äôt understand how people are resilient I never have been I can Äôt get back up when I Äôve fallen down and even if I manage to just barely pull myself up it isn Äôt long before I am knocked back down I hAte this all I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it And I can Äôt even express this pain without being accused of being obsessed with my own misery or bei criticized or judged even more so I Äôm constantly just suffering in silence and acting as if it Äôs all okay Fuck it all Fuck this life I know I Äôve said it so much in my life to myself my therapist s and sometimes even just the other people in my life that at this point it Äôs probably meaningless but I really have nothing left to live for and honestly I don Äôt know if I ever had anything to begin with This is not a life worth living to fight for anymore Unless a miracle happens within this next month completely out of my own control or action then this is over I Äôm done I can Äôt do it anymore I Äôm not putting in the effort to fight anymore for nothing I don Äôt care anymore",

    "input": "THIS POST WOULD ALSO FIT UNDER THERAPY RANT TL DR bad coping habit would like some suggestions to stop or manage better and also suggestions to relieve or manage extreme boredom Somethings yes I completely understand why I would get frustrated over losing it I Äôve lost my iPad tonight I use my iPad as a therapeutic drawing tool Im a digital illustrator amp have a couple different apps I use amp have been having lots of ideas pop up in my head recently so I really need to just sketch a quick one I every once in a while However even losing this while I understand a couple of things one being illustrating amp drawing for me is more than just a hobby amp or stress reliever distraction it Äôs a passion of mine one I Äôd like to get better at Which actually turns out I Äôm improving So when I lose this iPad even for a split second amp end up finding it or the opposite losing it for the entire evening not being able find until the next day or even sometimes hours later in the early morning What happens is I quite literally flip out to the point of my head hurting sometimes even my stomach starts to hurt I have been diagnosed and still have IBS so this is never a good thing to stress out to this point If my head hurts from stress then stomach pains will follow after That is currently the state I m in sadly The pains aren t so bad that they re unbearable It s still annoying enough that I m stressed to this point For the rest of the time that I can t find it all I can do until then is watch YouTube vids until my head or any physical pain goes away Once the physical pain starts then I can t do anything The physical pain can reach to extreme cases of carrying the stress in my neck or even the more stranger things having gas pains reaching down to my lower leg I end up having to take my as needed pain medications for this Of course I find that part even more frustrating If any of you have an ongoing hard to fix chronic pain diagnosis or even IBS you know how this is for sure Having these two back to back is bad enough and it makes it even worse when your stressed Now I also have a skin condition ecamza and of course I got this from ALSO being stressed so much So all these physical medical conditions I m diagnosed with is a true pain in the ass almost not metaphorically as you can tell pun unintended lol Back to the coping stuff Yt is one of my more healthier coping mechanisms I ve been doing recently and this is of course good and improvement from the past However one thing that still continues from past coping mechanisms is if my extreme boredom is at an all time high to the point of stress or even no stress and if I don t find anything to do this a bad thing for me We all know or have come to know with BPD anything is always to the extreme and any negative things are always a bad thing and bad to get over of Keeping this in mind I have a habit of picking at my skin I even know this is bad and the dangers it can cause such as infections from small to severe sores and scabs can form depending on how bad the skin is peeled off it can hurt pretty bad and bleed for a few mins which actually has happened to me many a time In the past esp past couple years towards the end of HS this habit really ramped up with the stress of completing hw getting scores to at least past tests standardized testing and such and graduation which was very stressful which is why this habit got to its worse Every day I came into therapy talking about this because I would have band aids and blood sores on my fingers This would get way out of control if my anxiety was through the rough or if I went through MDD BPD episodes Currently what I m doing to stop or manage the boredom isn t working out so well Most of the time it Äôs gotten to the point of where being bored has gotten in the way Even if the boredom is coming from just losing something such as my ipad like this time around it gets me very frustrated I ve learned more to watch YouTube vids but on occasion it gets me into this habit and it almost happened this time It s very frustrating as I m sure you can imagine I ve at least figured out this using an exercise my therapist taught me last summer CHAIN ANALYSIS The frustration of course then leads a chain linking analysis of anxious thoughts gt gt extreme frustration gt gt physical pains if any gt gt then the action is to pick Even if there are no scabs on my skin to pick at Even if there are absolutely no scabs no flaky easy to peel nails I still find something to pick which of course everytime result ends up creating scabs It s great I at least know what the cause is even being aware when it s happening and how it all links up together However as with any habit I have now it seems I have so much difficulty stopping anything especially this one FINAL THOUGHTS If anyone has any other coping mechanisms or ideas of why habits are so hard to stop let me know please I will say this I ve tried the whole meditation thing but I feel like the silence in your head your supposed to have doesn t necessarily work for me my head is an ongoing never ending talking machine haha Of course I ve also tried putting band aids or gloves on but as said above these didn t work either As an FYI currently I m not in therapy I used to be for about 2 years straight but I ve decided I just need a break I m sure that s understandable Commitment is very hard for me right now and has been hard since the beginning of the year and I didn t want to have my therapist end up having to cancel or move other patients around which sadly would sometimes happen to her Of course this isn t her fault at all I completely understand I just need to figure out how to be more committed to that If any of you have any habits that are hard to stop please let me know this as well and please don t hesitate to comment if you ve figured out a way to stop them or at least manage them better also this as well I need all the help ideas or suggestions even validation comments I can get",

    "input": "Sabotaging my own relationships is my crowning glory Splitting is a psychological mechanism which allows the person to tolerate difficult and overwhelming emotions by seeing someone as either good or bad idealized or devalued This makes it easier to manage the emotions that they are feeling which on the surface seem to be contradictory Always right or always wrong Good or evil The gray area doesn Äôt exist It may have never been perceived by myself Recognizing borderline personality disorder You have to have 5 out of 9 symptoms to be diagnosed and I have all 9 Fear of abandonment People with BPD are often terrified of being abandoned or left alone Even something as innocuous as a loved one arriving home late from work or going away for the weekend may trigger intense fear This can prompt frantic efforts to keep the other person close You may beg cling start fights track your loved one Äôs movements or even physically block the person from leaving Unfortunately this behavior tends to have the opposite effect Äîdriving others away Unstable relationships People with BPD tend to have relationships that are intense and short lived You may fall in love quickly believing that each new person is the one who will make you feel whole only to be quickly disappointed Your relationships either seem perfect or horrible without any middle ground Your lovers friends or family members may feel like they have emotional whiplash as a result of your rapid swings from idealization to devaluation anger and hate Unclear or shifting self image When you have BPD your sense of self is typically unstable Sometimes you may feel good about yourself but other times you hate yourself or even view yourself as evil You probably don Äôt have a clear idea of who you are or what you want in life As a result you may frequently change jobs friends lovers religion values goals or even sexual identity Impulsive self destructive behaviors If you have BPD you may engage in harmful sensation seeking behaviors especially when you Äôre upset You may impulsively spend money you can Äôt afford binge eat drive recklessly shoplift engage in risky sex or overdo it with drugs or alcohol These risky behaviors may help you feel better in the moment but they hurt you and those around you over the long term Self harm Suicidal behavior and deliberate self harm is common in people with BPD Suicidal behavior includes thinking about suicide making suicidal gestures or threats or actually carrying out a suicide attempt Self harm encompasses all other attempts to hurt yourself without suicidal intent Common forms of self harm include cutting and burning Extreme emotional swings Unstable emotions and moods are common with BPD One moment you may feel happy and the next despondent Little things that other people brush off can send you into an emotional tailspin These mood swings are intense but they tend to pass fairly quickly unlike the emotional swings of depression or bipolar disorder usually lasting just a few minutes or hours Chronic feelings of emptiness People with BPD often talk about feeling empty as if there Äôs a hole or a void inside them At the extreme you may feel as if you Äôre Äúnothing Äù or Äúnobody Äù This feeling is uncomfortable so you may try to fill the void with things like drugs food or sex But nothing feels truly satisfying Explosive anger If you have BPD you may struggle with intense anger and a short temper You may also have trouble controlling yourself once the fuse is lit Äîyelling throwing things or becoming completely consumed by rage It Äôs important to note that this anger isn Äôt always directed outwards You may spend a lot of time feeling angry at yourself Feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality People with BPD often struggle with paranoia or suspicious thoughts about others Äô motives When under stress you may even lose touch with reality Äîan experience known as dissociation You may feel foggy spaced out or as if you Äôre outside your own body I know that these symptoms aren Äôt all splitting but they all connect together and have splitting involved in them a one point or another You can be scared of abandonment and split when a loved one is leaving You could have a whirlwind courtship and fall in love extremely fast as those with BPD myself included tend to do and if someone isn Äôt going the pace you want them to Well you can split and push them away before they can leave you which ties into abandonment issues When you have an unclear self image sometimes making a mistake can cause a split You didn Äôt buy the right dish soap You Äôre an evil no good idiot Impulsive behaviors often cause splits for me If I don Äôt know the exact outcome of something and then in my made up schedule of how it Äôs supposed to go gets broken that causes me stress and will inevitably cause me to lash out in frustration Also Self harm isn Äôt always cutting or burning yourself Sometimes self harm can be simply punishing yourself for things in a way that seems odd A self harm I do on myself is ask questions I know I don Äôt want the answer to take my showers way too hot and constantly sabotage things I know I shouldn Äôt like friendships relationships and working relationships I am constantly in a swing of intense emotions I Äôll touch on it more at some point but I have quiet BPD Most people would never be able to actually tell the turmoil that goes on inside of me everyday I am in a constant pool of sadness anger frustration irritation and dissociation By the end of my day I Äôm too exhausted to function a lot of the time This matches up with feelings of chronic emptiness and excessive anger Though I am not violent or aggressive thought Äôs have come into my head I have also scared a friend with these thoughts even though I had no intention of actually following through with my thoughts they did not know that and it almost ruined our friendship They felt as though I was a threat that put a lot into perspective for me Being out of touch with reality is a difficult symptom This is the one I struggle with the most I often find myself spacing out and forgetting what I Äôm doing where I am or even what I Äôm saying Stress just makes this worse I have experienced episodes of dissociative amnesia at points of extreme stress Mostly when someone is really yelling at me and my body has almost gone into a third form of fight or flight and has just chosen to float When everything is just too much and so my brain shuts off into auto pilot for a while until my emotions can regulate to a point where I can handle stimulation I love how Mollie touches on how splitting can feel like you Äôre a child again Before therapy that Äôs something I always thought when it happened I Äôd feel like a toddler throwing a tantrum I just couldn Äôt stop or perceive at the moment A friend would cancel lunch Äúwell they just aren Äôt my friend anymore I hate them Äù Someone at my job gives me constructive criticism Äúwell they Äôre just a horrible person and I hate them and I wish they Äôd die Äù These thoughts come and go and I never want to act on them but it is a light switch moment In an instant I want to react in the most dramatic attention seeking harsh way possible I Äôve said before as a joke that I Äôd literally do anything for attention but it Äôs honestly not a joke which makes me very sad if I think about it for too long There Äôs a quote from the podcast in the 3rd episode that really touched me This is really painful for us as people with BPD because all we want in the world is to feel wanted and connected but our own behaviors and tendencies and things like splitting prevent that very that very desire That very feeling to be connected And that is the part of the reason BPD is so painful Mollie Marriott At the end of the episode I felt very tired The realization that someone knew to know that someone knew exactly what I was going through and how I felt was so liberating I can Äôt wait to hear more about BPD from Mollies perspective I feel like we Äôre kindered spirts in a way because I relate to her stories and feelings so much Of course that Äôs a BPD symptom but I do feel like she just Ä gets me",

    "input": "Hey all I m not sure if I have BPD or not my psych had said that he wasn t going to diagnose me since hormones symptoms of BPD that may exist without BPD itself etc can muddle the diagnosis I m 16 male Still I think I exhibit a lot of the symptoms of BPD to a troubling extent and so am making this post to potentially help someone Out of respect though I ll be flairing my post as Person w o BPD As someone who oscillates between absolutely extreme emotions every time a problem occurs or is incapable of seeing the other side of any personal situation I find it hard to manage life I attach myself extremely strongly to people and daydream about a life ahead of course to varying degrees of attachment with different people and plan in detail of the amazing adventures we could undertake A few days later whenever that person slights me I immediately and almost involuntarily not sure if that s the perfect word begin to hate them or self sabotage and thus hate myself Usually an unfortunate combination of the two The thing is I know that people can be morally grey They can be good or bad It seems only logical to me that people can be a jumbled mix of pros and cons While my brain knows my heart does not understand I think clearly in spite of an overwhelming tidal wave of emotions until my brain succumbs and can no longer think I am then guided by my heart towards irrationality and an ever perpetuating vicious cycle of hate and remorse What s more is I feel guiltier because I m afraid of improving I resist taking steps I deem objectively better and moral at the moment than the other because in a way I want to satisfy my selfish desires I absolutely hate this deeply entrenched fear of moving forward that I have It makes me doubt myself I fall into obsessive patterns of self doubt and rumination where I constantly try to reassure myself that I m not bad but I find myself unable to reason with myself and so I end up worse than before Am I really that bad Am I some evil monster who s stuck in an illusion of superficial improvement for the appeasement of his ego all while remaining the same bastard at his core I absolutely hate feeling like this It s hard to manage especially because I end up belittling myself by wondering how it is truly pathetic that I am in this state because of the actions of a single person yes I think I do have a favourite person on whom my emotional state unfortunately rides I think I ve always dealt with intense attachment issues and separation anxiety since I was a child I cried everytime my abusive mother would drop me off at school because though I later grew to hate her I was strongly attached to her I cried when my best friend spoke to someone else more than he did to me I began to notice patterns that only seemed to substantiate my beliefs I still don t trust myself and wonder if these patterns were real or imagined I cried and was driven to a deeper suicidal state when history began to repeat itself consistently unhealthy attachment to someone who had their own issues and was a polar opposite of what I needed followed by heartbreaking loneliness It s been happening almost every cycle Now however the situation is slightly different I m growing to recognize that my FP this time is not as bad as the previous ones I think think think think that I can trust for once I opened up about my unhealthy issues and was met with a mature response not a harsh rebuke So even now when I am in 2 minds over whether I should simply cut her off and go no contact or apologize 1 billion times in hopes of external validation that never seems to fulfill my ever growing need for reassurance I choose to write this post and do neither I m trying to improve I m proud of myself for not avoiding my issues and burying myself in doomscrolling obsessive thinking or productive activities The last one isn t bad lol but I need to prioritize myself And that s what I ve realized it s important to have constant written reminders of the good to tilt the balance slightly away from a wholly evil built up persona in my head I write in a small diary the things that mean a lot to me or things that I believe I need to remind myself of on a daily basis to ensure I don t stray too far out from being rational Apologies for the incredibly long background I will now move onto some of the other tips I have based on my personal experience what I ve extrapolated form certain media what my therapist said I sincerely hope it can help someone out there I apologize if I sound presumptuous I know that BPD is something that quite literally pervades all spheres of your life However if even one person can benefit from what I write I will be grateful And it s okay if that person is me Firstly I think it s important to understand that it is extremely hard and foolish to attempt a complete elimination of all that is bad I know it sounds laughable and obvious but I feel like I hold myself to absolutely unrealistic standards at times I want to get rid of all feelings of jealousy all insecurities And that is a bad ideal to chase Because you end up exhausting yourself and putting yourself at a disadvantage in the hopes of chasing a nigh impossible dream If my problems are currently at a pace where they hit me with their 100 it s unreasonable to expect a landslide victory wherein I kill the problem entirely Just reducing this 100 to a 80 is enough because once it s at 80 I can maybe just maybe tolerate it to a decent extent Holding myself to a standard of 70 60 or 0 just leads to guilt when I can t achieve those targets which worsens everything There s a technique like this in debating too mitigation You mitigate your opponent s arguments and talk about why what they said isn t as good as they make it out to be Or why they re only slightly right The ideal is to call the opponent utter bullshit instantly but that leads to flawed arguments i e flailing efforts from your end and your opponent your various issues jealousy insecurity for me wins by virtue of you effectively sabotaging yourself Secondly Though I usually absolutely hate motivational quotes and the like they often just reek of condescension to me tbh I have found myself understanding a fairly popular one more and more as adversities worsen From Nelson Mandela Courage is not the absence of fear but the ability to triumph over it The brave man is not one who is fearless but one who conquers that fear I first saw this quote in grade 5 I think I dismissed it then but I think I am one step closer to not reading it but understanding it Everytime I hate myself for being afraid of moving ahead and improving I remind myself of the quote If Nelson Mandela an undoubtedly brave man based on what I know said this then why am I holding myself to a standard of perfection Granted he was going through obviously far more than what I can probably comprehend but why can t I apply the same principles to myself And it really helps me when I tell myself that as long as the sum total of my actions tend more towards improvement than regression it s okay Of course I don t understand philosophy or anything along those lines at a high enough level to lay out dynamic and logical principles but it truly truly helps me when I tell myself that it s okay to be afraid and to fear the future to fear uncertainty But running away more often and with more significant consequences than I stand against my fears is something that needs further analysis and improvement Thirdly It helps me to detach especially from my family problems I am academically quite strong but it s creating a burden of overachievement that is suffocating me The other day I got full marks in a test I was quite happy since it s a subject I really struggle with And I was proud because I systematically studied the chapter and enjoyed the entire process for the first time But my mother shot me down rather than congratulating me her instinct was to say that 4 other kids also got full yes the class is incredibly competitive perks of being Indian and that I should be wary She wasn t wrong but it hurt I once came top 10 in the world for a debating competition and a few relatives said I need to do better next time it s epic that I came top 10 but next time I need to aim higher because no one likes a one trick pony When stuff like this happens or I question my passions in life I continuously remind myself that I can always quit It ll be uncomfortable and I ll face a lot of hate from my family if I quit doing what they want But if my willpower is strong enough I don t need to force myself through anything No one s holding a gun to my head and forcing me to continue working like the other kids It doesn t matter if I quit debating tomorrow because no one will die if I do that And once I realize this it becomes a tiny bit easier just 2 3 easier for me to realize that hey maybe I don t want to quit after all I tend to overthink about the future excessively and this really helps me It s not that I m saying we should ignore our problems but it s nice to once in a while pick and choose which ones to ignore Selective ignorance in a way Fourthly Perspective taking metacognition Apologies if this is slightly irrelevant I find that this is something more relevant to my struggles linked with OCD than just anxiety and insecurity Still it might prove helpful First metacognition This is something my psychiatrist told me to practice I found it useless initially because well he was effectively just telling me to think about my thoughts And all I could think was well wtf do you think I ve been doing But as always it took me a bit longer to realize what he was getting at Thinking about my thoughts reasoning with them Reasoning with them is impossible It means being as obtuse and annoying as possible and simply shutting down my thoughts as fast as possible Some negative thoughts pop in Nope Out you go Shoo stop talkingstoptalking ad infinitum It s a game of cat and mouse that happens throughout the day throughout the year and possibly throughout my life It s hard it hurts it hurts a lot It s exhausting But it s worth it because I truly feel proud of myself for overcoming these tiny obstacles Thinking of my own thoughts and analysing a chain of events leading to a breakdown makes it easier to prevent it in the future by minimizing the trigger Second perspective taking My therapist told me to do this whenever I find myself infuriated at a lack of effort from my FP or my friends My 100 is often intense unhealthily so It again leads me to expect unrealistic reactions I will be honest with myself here I found expected unrealistic reactions especially when I was going through a hard time because I wanted someone else to go through the effort of saving me It s hard to admit but it is a bitter pill I need to swallow When I catch myself expecting perfection from someone I try to think from their perspective Hey maybe they re doing their best given the circumstances they re facing And it helps lower my expectations I don t want to get rid of them entirely because obviously that makes it impossible to sift through the sea of red flags in the world today Still just this lil bit helps It also helps me curb unrealistic expectations Remember the other kids I m sure there s absolute monsters out there who can study for 12 hours on end without a break and manage a good life on top of it I truly admire and envy them because they re essentially achieving what I ve wanted But whenever I find myself wishing that I was more like them I try to stop myself It would be arrogant of me to assume that I m good enough to stand shoulder to shoulder to literally the top 0 0001 I ll be borrowing a few ideas from my favourite series Haikyuu here but it s as if these people don t have a single errant thought apart from working for their future and for their dreams They don t care much for approval for adulation for victory they just do what s needed for themselves More importantly from someone s perspective I m sure I come across as one of the other kids And I question myself just how many of these other kids are like me That really cuts down the number of geniuses of hardwork I find myself facing And I m not like them And that s okay I don t need to be top 100 in life to succeed the goal is not to be the best but to be good enough for myself Everytime I remind myself of this I find myself slightly calmer than before Taking the perspective of others is one of the best things I ve ever learnt to try and do I m sure it seems like I m an arrogant and pompous guy who has finally got everything working and now is preaching like a higher moral authority I do apologize since I think I see how it could come across as that but using perspective taking I remind myself and whoever is reading this that I am not 100 okay I still hold unrealistic expectations and end up self harming when the going gets extremely tough or when my FP reacts slightly coldly I don t like those parts of me but I remind myself that I don t self harm daily now I can resist the urge at times And I still fall into obsessive cycles of self doubt Those times are harsh But during moments like these I like being relatively okay I like the knowledge that I ve improved enough to breakdown say 7 times rather than 10 Just like in debating victory is rarely found in demolishing the opponent Instead it s found in eking out a number of marginal minor victories at the points of clash The culmination of these small victories over a period of time makes a massive difference To contradict 14 year old u Feels_Bad_Man19 once again and use 2 quotes Rome was not built in a day and Little drops of water make the ocean Taking things step by step is more powerful than I realized it s hard but it s been worth it I only hope that no matter what difficulties I come across I find myself working towards improvement in some form or the other eventually Continual fresh starts are truly underrated To yet again quote someone from Haikyuu Today you are the defeated What will you be tomorrow",

    "input": "So back in 2020 around August I was prescribed 20 mg of lovan per day and quickly went up to 60mg my doctor thought it would be best to set me up with an ssri for my anxiety depression and PTSD first before putting me on an anti psychotic to assist with my BPD after about a month or less on lovan I was then put on Seroquel I don t know the exact dossage other than it was the highest I could have after a 3 4 week trial run The first one to three months were fairly great whilst I did get tired I was managing and combined with DBT is it I felt like I might of been getting better but then month 4 hit Month 4 I quit my job and missed just one therapy appointment and never went back and my psychologist leaving the practice just solidified my choice Month four also was my last ever relapse I believe Once month 5 hit I became basically a shell of my former self my memory was almost non existent and I felt almost nothing so whilst it cured my BPD it also got rid of every other aspect of me The only time I experienced anything was by carefully setting up arguments between people and being an actual piece of shit The following months up to the 10th month when I quit are very patchy it s like like having a bubble of information that you know Is there and you know the type of information buy nothing of its contents Entire days weeks and even months just went bye plauged with dissisciation and simply empytneas everyday I was slumping around music in face buried in my table at school near unconscious my whole existence was pointless I often found myself sitting on rooftops just wondering why don t I Slowly but surely I drove all my friends away I just didn t care about them hell I hardly even viewed people as having worth other than biding my time Everyday I felt high Well clearly delirious eventually I just started taking lower doses then I started smoking weed and at the ten month mark June 2021 at just recently turning 16 I dropped the fucking meds switched to weed once a week and worked hard on myself I know can confidently say I m doing so much better I go to school I work I have friends and whilst my mental disorders have returned and still affect me weed has really helped getting through those times So yeah there you have it the story of someone bring prescribed meds at 15 and becoming a corpse",

have the faintest idea what it was and honestly don Äôt think I had ever heard the term before Before she told me I already cared about her a lot and we seemed to be like 2 peas in a pod A quick intense attraction and love for each other After she told me she had BPD I knew that no matter what it was I would do as much as I could to support her and stay with her and help her be happy I was an amazing guy understanding patient giving loving supportive but I Äôm not who I think I am Over time she started splitting she would have very intense reactions she would drink a lot which would make her reactions even worse So much yelling we had the cops called to my apartment at least 4 or 5 times and they told us if they get called back again that they Äôll arrest us both for wasting resources She would stay at my apartment and sometimes not say a single word to me and not want me anywhere near her for days and sometimes she would stay at my apartment and we Äôd be connected by some type of skin on skin contact at every moment of the day for days She was so happy and she would tell me how our relationship felt like ÄúChristmas Äù and I felt the exact same way She was so sad and angry and she would tell me how our relationship was the worse one she had ever been in and I would tell her we Äôll get through it I even found a book on loving someone with BPD with good reviews and started reading it to learn more She said I was a manipulator a liar a gaslighter she said I probably had Narcissist Personality Disorder after knowing me for a very short amount of time We would argue about these things and so many more We lost time that could have been so much happier ÄúNot wasted Äù as she would say I was an amazing guy understanding patient giving loving supportive but I Äôm not who I think I am She didn Äôt split just for the hell of it she didn Äôt get angry for nothing she didn Äôt call me a narcissist for no reason she didn Äôt break up with me multiple times on a whim I wasn Äôt an amazing guy I wasn Äôt understanding I wasn Äôt patient I wasn Äôt giving I wasn Äôt loving I wasn Äôt supportive I didn Äôt show empathy I raised my voice I yelled I kicked her out and I called her over I stepped over her boundaries and I wasn Äôt even aware even when I was told I invalidated her I didn Äôt take enough time to try to understand what she was going through I wasn Äôt patient when she had her highs and her lows I wasn Äôt loving when I should have stopped and listened instead of just reacting I wasn Äôt supportive when she loved me and needed me I wasn Äôt supportive when she hated me and needed me I yelled at her when she showed up in my time of need I loved her so much but I didn Äôt have the faintest idea on how to actually love her and I definitely didn Äôt know who I was Every time I made a mistake toxic behavior towards supporting her listening to her loving her I would tell her I am going to change and reflect and do my best I did what I though was the best but I should have done so much more she deserved so much more One day she held up two stuffed lambs one brand new clean no holes The other old and dirty and tattered and ripped up and losing its stuffing She said ÄúIm this one the dirty one the one that Äôs broken and can Äôt be loved and trying to love her would end up with me being hurt Äù I told her ÄúShe Äôs this one the old one the one that has struggled through life the one that fought countless battles alone the one that deserves to be loved the one that is no less deserving of support and love than the other Äù Almost the whole time I knew her she claimed I was a Narcissist overtime her opinion changed to maybe I had BPD I never made a conscious decision to react strongly to her when I was mad I never made a conscious decision to not support her to not listen I never made a conscious decision to yell I never made a conscious decision to not give her space I never made a conscious decision to be so afraid of abandonment or to make such reckless impulsive decisions I did make conscious decisions to stop this behavior from me and only make her happy I tried so hard but my unhealthy behavior was still there I don Äôt believe in God too much but I would I lay awake and pray that he would give me the strength to stop reacting and to just love and be patient and don Äôt get angry and to just listen and understand but I couldn Äôt change because I couldn Äôt even open my eyes enough to see the source of my behavior because I Äôm not who I think I am After knowing her and learning about BPD and going through the traits with her Im almost certain that I have BPD as well Chronic feelings of emptiness Self destructive Impulsive decisions intense unstable relationships with Highs and Lows identity issues abandonment issues problem with anger and extreme emotions recently dissociation anxiety and only very occasionally thoughts of suicide I loved her more than I could really describe and wanted nothing but a very long future and family with her but I didn Äôt know how unhealthy I was I never wanted to cause her sadness or to be sad I think now that she might have been a Favorite Person as we spent practically every day all day together and we loved it We were toxic and we were intoxicating We were in love and we were in hate We couldn Äôt bear be apart even a second and we couldn Äôt bear be together even a second She Äôs gone and I will probably never see her again or hug her again or massage her feet or rub her butt as she liked me to rub it or hear her my name spoken through her beautiful voice or even just get a chance to tell her all these words in person She Äôs gone but she is all around me and I imagine that I Äôm all around her ENDING CONTINUED IN

    "input": "This will probably be long and I wrote a little about it the other day so sorry I recently cheated on my fiancee who I love dearly I don t know why I don t exactly k ow what cause me to do it But it was multiple flings in short periods of time I snapped It s my fault I confessed To be fully honest it was 5 fucking times 5 times on 2 trips 4 with guys and 1 with a female prostitute After the first trip which was two guys I viewed it as ok I was curious but it wasn t my thing so I wanted to bury it and never say a word It was eating me up but I couldn t ruin mine or her life Then a month later I went on another work trip Big fuck up Vegas 2 guys Then one prostitute These times alcohol was heavily involved but still not a good excuse I feel terrible and like I wasn t myself I confessed She did not find out I told her the night after I got back It was the worst night ever Literal he ll Threw away 4 happy years together I still can t get over it I always though I had bi polar but went to Dr the next day or 2 and they quickly identified that and previous stories from my past as clear borderline personality disorder My life has been a fucking mess ever since getting the diagnosis a little over a week ago Just sheer chaos I m trying to work on myself but I just hate everything about me I ve gone to a few therapy sessions but I feel I ve already thrown my life away What good is it now I think the only person who loves me is my mom If she wasn t alive I 100 would kill myself I really don t have a will do live I hate what I did to my fiance I ve been struggling with lack of emotion for some time now This is the first I feel like I m feeling anything in a while But it s way to overwhelming I don t even feel like I m gay either I just did it because it was easy I didn t learn anyone s names I just used people I really don t know what happened to me My life got so off the rails I describe it as I ve been on autopilot for so long Yet I feel different almost every day But now autopilot doesn t work and there are a bunch of passengers relying on me but I never actually learned how to fly the plane And I have to act like I do Every fucking day It truly is hell I feel really really bad The only 2 positives I can take away are that I now have gotten closer to my mom who I ve always pushed away and been very negative towards My issues come from my dad not her and that I clearly do have feelings But I ruined my fiances life I have started therapy and DBT sessions will begin in a week or so but I do not know what to expect My will to live is pretty shot and goes up and down and up and down I started Journaling but I keep splitting and pointing out issues in our relationship It s like I m still trying to catch her cheating It s fucking ridiculous Now I m feeling bad because I feel like I stole 4 years from her Even though the 4 years were mostly really really good in my opinion Shit just kinda hit the fan over the past month or 2 I lost control I keep having this fake argument in my head I hear her saying you stole my life I can never get back this time And all I can respond with is that no one is giving me back all the time I lost going through the hell I went through growing up No one stopped that My mom and I went through hell and people just let it happen I understand I can t just hurt people because I was hurt And I know what I did was wrong I know I have problems I didn t mean to hurt her I just didn t even think about her I didn t think at all I never think I ve done so much stupid stuff over the years I hate it Now that there is an actual diagnosis it s all getting to real No I have to face the fact that I truly live a nightmare everyday And the one part of it that was good is now gone People say suicide is selfish But is it Is it more selfish to make someone deal with their pain day in and day out just so you don t have to think about it If I did it people would eventually move on But I live with my pains every fucking day I don t know what mood I ll be in tomorrow I don t know if I ll freak out over something little If I fucked up her life why can t I decide my punishment The death penalty is a thing Why go thru the red tape when you can expedite it I promised my fiancee probably soon to be ex and my mom I wouldn t do anything stupid so I m trying to hold to that and I think I will keep that promise But it fucking hurts And I really don t think see why it would be selfish of me to do it I m open to hearing others thoughts",

    "input": "I want to talk about this in the least selfish way I can It s hard because I know it s not her fault and I adore her but if I m not honest about it somewhere i will spiral MAJOR TW talk of SH and su cid3 I will not go into any detail ofc but it will come up One of my best friends of nearly 3 years lives with BPD Recently as in only in the last 2 weeks she disclosed to me that I have become her favourite person I didn t think much of it at first I knew it wasnt something to be taken lightly but I never could have thought it would have had the impact that it has and I don t know how much longer I can cope I will try and explain A day or two after she told me I had become her FP she told me that she was going to buy blades to S H I spent hours trying to convince her not to do it but ultimately i couldnt stop her We spoke after she did and she seemed like she was feeling a bit better by the end of the night so I went to bed because I had work early the next day I woke up to a text she d sent me at 3am telling me she was going to end it all I tried and tried but I couldn t get a hold of her so very long story short I called a crisis line and they sent someone to her house to check she was alright Turns out she was asleep and they woke her up afer which she called me and the first thing she said was what is wrong with you she started laughing saying I was doing too much and I should have known she wasn t going to do it first thing in the morning that I woke her up from her sleep and it wasn t that serious I was distraught I hadn t felt fear like I did when I saw that text in a long time I was on my way to work on the brink of tears thinking I would never see her again We had a fight about it because I was trying to make her understand just how much her response had hurt me I wasnt angry at her for feeling suicidal or even for telling me about it I was upset at how she made me feel like I was exaggerating and had ruined her morning But that in turn made her upset because she felt like she was a bad friend and I was going to leave her She had a complete breakdown that went on for id say about 2 days and I had to just pretend that it didnt affect me and I over it because from the way she was talking she was going to attempt again if I stayed upset with her I actually found the blades she bought the other day when I went to her house she started picking up the box and playing with it so I took it from her and she kept trying to grab me and go in my pockets to get it back saying it was hers and SH was the same as smoking so if I was allowed to have cigarettes she should have a right to harm herself It went on for forever And she knows I m recovering from self harm myself but she doesn t seem to even consider me at all anymore Despite just how upset it made me she s brought it up again in a joking context Joking that her suicidal ideation affected me more than it did her still joking that I was doing too much and I should have known she wasn t that serious But I can t express to her any time shes doing anything that s had a remotely negative impact on me because it sends her into a breakdown Recently I tried to tell her to just give me a warning if she s going to talk about SH which she often will do spontaneously in graphic detail because I myself am in recovery and she got so upset that she stopped talking to me for almost the entire day She constantly asks me if I like my other friends more than her She can t accept that I have other friends that I love as much as her She has said that if i really loved her i would drop everything and everyone around me for her If i talk about other plans with other people if i talk about how much i love other people around me or anything positive that they ve done she makes me tell her that I feel the same about her She makes me say i love her over and over and over again and asks me if I really mean it because she doesn t think I do If i text her the wrong way she makes me change what I said and promise her i didn t mean it the way she interpreted it but the thing it sometimes it will be as simple as a letter in the wrong place or that I didn t capitalise something I talked about how the person I m seeing right now has given me a boost of self confidence and she said do i not make you feel confident am i not doing enough that s another thing She excessively hates the person I m seeing right now We haven t had the perfect start to the relationship and they ve made a couple mistakes but have redeemed themselves in my eyes the mistakes were nothing serious in the slightest But she has literally banned me from talking about him Like I m not exaggerating she won t let bring them up unless it s negative talk or she just ignores me If i even mention their name she gets angry I understand being a bit funny towards them because of some of the mistakes they ve made but the severity at which she despises this person it scares me sometimes And maybe it s worth mentioning I really do not think it s a case of her having feelings for me because she s gay and I m a guy If we re on the phone she won t let me hang up She tells me if i go then I m leaving her and i dont love her even if I have things to do she just tells me to stay on the phone and she ll mute herself If I go to her house she basically doesn t let me leave She ll beg me to stay longer even if I have work the next day or if it s really late and i need to get the last train And I mean she ll be on the verge of tears I m starting to get really scared if i am honest Yesterday she told me she needs to give me something of hers to remember her by and then when i told her that im really worried about her she just told me i dont need to be worried and it s fine My emotions feel like they re being shaken every time I am with her As someone who was a victim of nearly 2 decades of domestic and child abuse i am in no way trying to say that my abuser is comparable to her but sometimes some of the things she says and does scare me in the same way that he did The feeling on edge the not being able to leave the worrying about if I m saying and doing the wrong thing all the time I think she s trying to isolate me from the people around me She keeps telling me about how all the people who are no longer in her life are horrible people and she is never the problem Some of them she says they just felt wrong or felt like they didn t care about her enough This includes ex FPs And I know this is a bit mean to say but i am starting to wonder if that s really the case and if I will become one of those so called horrible people at some point I don t know what to do I miss what our friendship was like before all this If I m honest I am still so so so upset with her about the su cid3 call incident that happened last week amongst some other things but I can t tell her that And on top of that the other day at work we work together she just switched on me for seemingly no reason later she told me it s because she thought she was being a bad friend to me and felt guilty about it and stopped talking to me completely and was actively doing things to make the job harder And then when i tried to tell her how that made me feel she told me she was in the bathroom looking for something poisonous to drink It was just me and her in the store I can t cope with this anymore I feel so so guilty saying it but i feel like there is a weight on me It s barely even been 2 weeks and I feel so heavy Since becoming her FP we ve barely had a normal conversation She just talks to me all the time about how she wants to end it all how she s SHing how she doesn t believe I love her etc etc etc I want to save our friendship but I fear if i even suggest something like we should have some space even if i promise her i will come back and this isn t me ending the friendship either she will never talk to me again or something worse But the way she s made me feel these past 2 weeks I don t even really want to talk to her sometimes Any advice would be more than welcome There are more things that have happened but I feel like I ve given enough detail and this is already much longer than I intended it to me",

    "input": "I don Äôt really know what I mean to accomplish here but I saw some helpful venting posts and figured hey let Äôs give this a shot it Äôs been a while I learned I had several BPD symptoms about 10 years ago and college and ever since it Äôs been a work in progress When I first read about the disorder it was like reading a case study on myself Lots of things made sense in that moment and I Äôve grown to understand BPD quite well I Äôve learned extensively about the disorder read anecdotes for over a decade discussed it with a few therapists mostly receiving derision or dismissive as a response I Äôve meta analyzed my own thinking patterns methods of regulation and behaviors in detail I always faced strife with relationships and identity beforehand but figuring out these were symptoms almost made it easier to approach I Äôve always been a very rational logical person In a way I Äôve come to see this as a coping mechanism to counteract the splitting and emotional responses I have to stimuli In my eyes it Äôs easier to react appropriately if you are always establishing a firm factual foundation go alliteration of events that occur instead of relying on in the moment emotional stimuli Learning about the nature of bpd and affect instability it may cause further lead me to lean onto self awareness and logic to dictate my actions While this has remained a challenge especially with family it has become more my norm and an unconscious habit despite high emotionally volatility internally However having come to a point where I Äôm in control far more often than not I feel like I Äôm constantly going through extra steps to self regulate and modify my behavior to norms or hide what I Äôm actually feeling in that process I feel like I Äôm a way I Äòsolved Äô my bpd symptoms to function well high accolades at work stable friendships and family dynamics intrinsic self worth and identify formation but inside I always know I Äôm different broken and the moment I slip up it will shock the people around me This puts SO much pressure to be perfect and hide my symptoms and past to avoid it all crumbling down I Äôve come to terms with people leaving and I Äôve come to terms that sometimes friendships are not genuine or sustainable I Äôve only told 4 people outside of my family about my BPD 2 were good Äòfriends Äô around the time learned about it I told them about what I go through how I perceive and feel the world and how sometimes that makes me want to end it I had been suicidal in the past for many tangible and abstract reasons Both those people ghosted me pretty fast and I can Äôt say I was surprised I felt Inherently unlovable and broken and did not expect acceptance in any form I spent the next half decade or so in several stages of life that included addiction homelessness and ptsd all while being so aware of my surroundings and feelings Anhedonia may have put me in a deep hole but it keep me on this earth Fortunately I was able to come out of this horrible phase of life on my own Since I Äôve always had a strong sense of resilience and inner Strength I truly believed I managed many symptoms that had plagued me and felt whole for the first time In a sense I Äôve never lost that feeling for wholeness About 2 years about I met a new fp out of nowhere It had been over 5 years since my last which ended with me crying desperately on the phone begging them not to leave This hit me so hard I felt so many emotions A lot of dormant triggers popped back up I felt like over the next year I had to relearn how to work on my BPD symptoms She had avpd and we both hurt each other a lot before we both abandoned each other I spiraled so hard and it felt like literal death but I knew that I could do it A while ago I stopped viewing my BPD as a curse and instead as a superpower My intuition physiology and emotions are assets that can lead to amazing outcomes if it utilized properly The way we feel as a person bpd can lead to real and unconditional love with the right people We have the agency and urgency to really care about others even if the approach is a work in progress I tried to reconnect with the person and we had a falling out again before we even talked about our issues the first time around I split hard and let the bpd win that round At first I felt intense shame that I was not perfect and let the symptoms beat out my awareness because that Äôs the crazy thing about bpd you may be 100 percent aware and still make the wrong decisions actions This doesn Äôt make us bad or fake it is our symptoms and we must be kind and patient with our inner child who is hurting Since then I Äôve made an amazing friend who makes me feel heard safe and understood I recently told her about my bpd and she said that won Äôt ever change anything between us and has consistently been there and shown up for me when she knows I Äôm struggling internally She checks up on me when I don Äôt check in because she doesn Äôt want me to feel abandoned Despite this I Äôm scared that it will be another failed friendship this really matters to me that my splitting which I Äôm experiencing more frequently lately will destroy it again and that I don Äôt deserve such a good friend And it feels like the closer I get to people and the closer they are to becoming my fp that Äôs when the dormant Neurosis emerge the ones I Äôve worked on for years but can suddenly ruin my relationships and life in a moment This rant was entirely too long and much longer than expected I used to journal a lot to understand but I pretty much stopped when I found out about my bpd It Äôs been a While since I Äôve truly connected with others about my diagnosis and experiences and reading experiences of others compelled me to overshare mine Hope everyone struggling with bpd knows that they are worthy of love caring and consistency and that your emotions don Äôt define who you are I can relate to your heart hurt and stand with all of you ù Ô è",

    "input": "Hello I d like to get insight from people who had an experience with diagnosed bpd and its treatment regarding the current situation I m in with my mental health and especially with my therapist I ll try to describe the situation as clearly as possible without making the post too long I m a 21 year old girl I ve been in therapy since I was 19 never got diagnosed with anything because my first therapist didn t have the tools to do so I ve switched therapists in September 2021 because the public healthcare service that provided therapy for me had reached the maximum number of meetings they could give me I m still in public healthcare just another service I struggle with a lot of things that are listed as bpd symptoms experiences but I ve never brought the hypothesis up to either of my therapists because I didn t want it to come across as self diagnosing since I m strongly against it Anyways recently my mental health declined radically I started having intrusive thoughts which lead to very debilitating anxiety derealization and panic attacks therefore I went to a psychiatric urgent care meeting I only disclosed the debilitating symptoms expecting them to either think I had no illness at all and just a high level of stress or something related to anxiety instead they began asking me questions and immediately brought up bpd to me as a possible diagnosis obviously it s not confirmed but they want me to be followed by a psychiatrist and get tested observed further which took me by surprise The issue at hand is that my therapist always seems to kinda downplay dismiss things the week before I started having panic attacks she said she thought I could get better by therapy alone and could go without meds and when we talked about what the psychiatrist had told me she said that a lot of the things are just probably a generational thing isn t 21 an age where you can get diagnosed though etc Partially it s on me because I ve never been good at expressing what s going on in my head or at least the intensity or relevancy of my issues because I don t want others to worry or to come off as dramatic Now I m waiting for the psychiatrist to call me back to start our meetings but in the meantime am I reading too much into this by feeling dismissed by my therapist Is it my fault because I m not able to express myself properly in therapy How should I go about this besides obviously waiting to start a proper psychiatric journey Any insight would be helpful",
