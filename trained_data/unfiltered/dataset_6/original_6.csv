you have consistantly provoked the other side with your endless efforts in censorship of anything that even remotely disagrees with your view of events that occured during this tragic part of history By not accepting the immense suffering of Turks under the hand of the Armenians and the foreign occupiers you are in fact insluting the memory of these people This unfortunately has very much been the position of Armenians and their western supporters the fact that the value attached to the lives of non christians is far less important This sickening attitude goes on today you just have to look at dysfunctional Iraq where hundreds of thousands of civilians have been massacred in what conveniantly known as collateral damage If you had a more open mind and respect for others maybe this topic would look much better today If you are going to go back to your whining arguments of how the poor innocent armenians without provocation were massacred please refrain from doing so because we have danced to the tune so many times already,Attacking Behavior
well well looks like we have the usual suspects Fatdix Hectorian Khoikhoi and Latinus from the Armenian Genocide topic who are it seems ganging up to hijack this topic You fools are so predictable and pathetic stop whining and get over your superiority complexes already Sorry I forgot to mention NikoSliver the Greek fanatic who regularly tries to sully topics related to Turkey,Attacking Behavior
Again I disagree with you if you were a bit more attentive you would have noticed that I put this issue into the talk page see PKEand non of the instigators bothered even to respond they were busy with a revert war This 3rr is highly unfair in this case because the other side is ganging up so you have several contributors reverting thereby avoiding a violation of the 3rr I strongly suggest that you reconsider the highly POV revert,Attacking Behavior
You re not helping me User Zora Right now I don t want to hear anything other than an explanation for why it s okay for User Khoikhoi to just go up there and remove the dispute tags placed in by others but it s not okay for me to replace a dispute tag with a one that better reflects the situation we re having,Attacking Behavior
I ask you again to reconsider your revert this point was submitted to the talk page but the vandals decided to ignore it and go into a revert war instead Unless you give me a valid reason for your revert followed by the block I cannot consider you as a neutral participant in this matter Do you really believe that your are going to resolve this issue with this attitude of yours Think again,Attacking Behavior
Watch out for the hijackers Fadix THOTH Latinus Khoikhoi nikosilver Hectorian etc They are ganging up against topics related to Turks and take turns in a revert war in order to avoid violating the 3rr These not so cunning group of Armenians Greeks and their friends are racist Turk haters and are keen to sully any topic that is even remotely related to Turks Please be vigilent on these serial hijackers they operate in tandem,Attacking Behavior
it seems you have not even bothered to read the contents of my posting above Let me repeat myself I RAISED THE ISSUE ON THE TALK PAGE before this became a revert war If you wish to ignore that point thats your perogative but if you decide to revert and then block the site I am afraid thats far from being considered a neutral stance I dont know if you realize this but with your arrogant attitude and actions you have succeeded in making this matter a whole lot worse If you were truly neutral on this matter you would have raised the issue with me and warned me regarding blocking the site You did none of that a bit like shooting the prisoner and then asking questions In light of the above I again ask you to reconsider,Attacking Behavior

Short response I have to say I haven t read all the discussions here but I can tell you re talking about race No one is talking about race here Read the article Where s race being discussed We re not talking about a Jewish race We re talking about an ethnic group Hopefully you know the difference between a race and an ethnic group An ethnic group is a group of people who closely identify with one another sometimes through having common ancestors but not necessarily so and share a unique culture and language Persian Jews definitely fall in this category They identify closely with one another for most of their history Persian Jews have been living in secluded Jewish ghettos and they most certainly share a unique culture and language Questioning the ethnicity of Persian Jews is simply absurd Let me also re quote this sentence from Britannica Encyclopedia The Jews trace their heritage in Iran to the Babylonian Exile of the 6th century BC and like the Armenians have retained their ethnic linguistic and religious identity Discussing race might not be appropriate here but discussing ethnicity definitely is,Attacking Behavior

Thanks for the comment I think has made this a little too personal and I m not even sure why This is part of a broader content dispute and he has made some statements that can only be interpreted as taking sides due to clear misunderstandings the users initiating that page are not Iranians but on the contrary are minority groups so he s reading the whole thing completely backward I m not sure what I might have done to deserve this but he tried to warn me against attacking the same user before but I did not think of it as an attack and gave a full explanation as to why No matter what happens here I m going to be filing an RfC demanding an investigation into this It looks to me like this user has a history of blocking people for unnecessary reasons Like I said this is unacceptable I called that person a troll because he was indeed using provocative language pointing me out by name and then asking me to review WP CIVIL for making an edit he doesn t like and I did not threaten him with a block I was referring to his block on Iranian peoples for violating 3RR This is unacceptable,Attacking Behavior

Connections to Jason Gastrich Welcome Just so you know you voted in a controversial AfD that has recently been hit with a parade of suspected sock puppets and meat puppets It would benefit you to mention how you came across the 5 day old AfD to make your first and only edit in two months which is also your 6th ever edit Especially since it has been revealed that a banned user has been purposely recruiting people to vote in the AfD Also since your first edit and only edit in two months relates to Jason Gastrich and his program to recuit keep votes you should reveal any possible relationship you have with him Also I am curious why your first and only edit in two months is on an AfD and your only edits relate to pages that Gastrich was pushing POV on during that time Again welcome,Attacking Behavior

You seem to be arguing that wikipedia should categorize this article as mythology because your source is that Encyclopedia Britannica categorizes Leviathan as mythology The multiple logical fallacies here should be apparent Getting back on topic there are numerous religious organizations with hundreds of millions of followers that teach the Tower of Babel was a historical event and you are also arguing that their point of view should not be respected beause apparently you think you have found some kind of superior knowledge to them to be able to state that it was not a historical event But wikipedia should be neutral and should not use such biased and non neutral language to take sides and declare any one scripture to be mythology your own pov notwithstanding It must not take any stand whatsoever on whether it is historical or mythological but should just present all the evidence and let readers make up their own mind instead of trying to make it up for them Your attempts to use wikipedia as a platform for pushing one pov against another are going to be resisted By the way it might be more to the point if you can find an Encyclopedia that calls Tower of Babel mythology not Leviathan Tower of Babel is primarily a Biblical story note the word primarily Leviathan is not,Attacking Behavior

Thank you very much for your encouraging words However I made my dicsion after doing a thorough checking of Arbustoos s footprints on the Wiki I notice that he has been systematically deleting information related to conservative Christians and conservative Christian organizations He mutiliates where he cannot delete And he adds information in such a clever manner that even what is right leads to humiliation An apology can be more humiliating than an insult What is more I notice that none repeat NONE has been able to stop his adventures He is freely doing what he wants to and none of you has been able to stop him from his anarchy Else show me one example where any of you has stopped him in his tracks Why is it that he has always got to be right His POVs are NPOVs while researched stuff by us is POV or simply garbage because there is no arbitrator between him and me Just show me one example of arbitration in my case I also notice that others who contributed to this article on Johnson C Philip are not raising their voice I know one of them my junior who also did research on Philip He told me he would never come back to Wiki so disappointed was he also to see Arbustoo having his way and none of you coming to arbitration We both have meaningful occupation in life and cannot fight against a person who can do anything without us having an arbitrator Thanks for being nice to me,Emotional Distress

Listen well I was certainly happy to return to Wikipedia and I wanted to edit articles The only issue I ve ever truly had is you and your friends When you found out about who I was you teased me insulted me behind my back and through e mail etc etc which is why I have become so angered with the community Is this really necessary Yes you are certainly allowed to do whatever you want but some comments just pushed my buttons which is why from time to time I exhibited infinite and random stupidity Of course I am going to admit this â because I did No an arbitration will not be necessary because I am leaving the second We Belong Together finishes FAC and this is not a lie Will I return Maybe I am not going to be present throughout late Juneâ late September I ll be studying elsewhere in the world Therefore I will not be making edits on Wikipedia during this time However following September I might come back Just do me this one favour if you find out who I am if I return please don t tease me and do the things you have done that was why I became uncivil and angered Again if you find out just leave me to be and we wouldn t have to get caught up in such a fiasco I really do wish you well Seriously My only complaint is that HeyNow10029 is complaining because she knows that I was right about the images in the Kelly Clarkson article Why exactly does each image that she uploaded onto the website have to be displayed and not the ones with actual and very strong fair use rationale I know you re tired of reading this that being you ever did so see you The last message I post here will be the final goodbye after WP FAC is completed â,Emotional Distress

Tuf Kat I m tired I do not care at all None cares of these underground genres Old Electronic music and New Age fans do not need and do not use Wikipedia as primary source New electronic music fans simply ignore or really can t understand differences and proper analogies between genres So ther is no point to fill this gap Though there are thousands people sharing my point of view there is no way to involve them in a battle against younger Wikiusers Feel free to do what you want Wikipedia is only a stupid game I m no longer interested in contributing on these topics Usually users that remove dispute templates are immediately banned but these harrassers aren t yet Maybe Wikipedia is theirs and none else has to touch their toy Enjoy it I ll not post anything else on music genres Bye,Emotional Distress

Lists that combine categories On the AfD for List of Jewish American criminals and victims you wrote Comment Does anyone think that this sort of list is substantially different from List of Jewish actors and actresses If so I d like to understand exactly why I don t know if you re aware that in January 06 there was extensive discussion of the issue of lists that try and combine a person s ethnic or religious affiliation with something completely unrelated to that The extreme example discussed at some length there was List of Methodist dentists I missed that discussion but having looked through it recently as I ve watch the AfD comments I m really disappointed that the community did not come to an acceptable consensus on the question I see a difference between the list you cite and the list under discussion primarily because the criminals and victims is so contentious and potentially offensive We ve seen the comments from While I can see some way in which a list of people who were victims because they were Jewish gay missionaries could have merit but I m not sure it warrants inclusion on Wikipedia I cannot see how a list of criminals could have the same merit To act in a manner that is criminal is effectively a declaration that the faith into which you were born or claim by conversion is effectively a sham So I am against the list of criminals and victims remaining not only because it not doing anything of value in the context of an encyclopedia but because it is potentially offensive As for the list of actors I am against their creation since they do not seem to have encyclopedic value Such a list combines two aspects of a person s life that do not inherently have value A list of Jewish scholars of Christianity for example might be a very interesting list There is a category combination that i see has genuine value It was said that a List of Islamicist athletes has values because such athletes choose to recognise aspects of the Koran in the way that they compete women wearing a burka spelling for example So I ve come to the position that both lists you mention are unencyclopedic but was willing to accept the view of a majority that a List of Jewish actors and actresses was something I can put up with A List of Jewish American criminals and victims is too contentious to remain,Safe/Neutral

Hello I noticed that you have wrote on my talk page I do know the user McFly85 personally We both were in a computer lab checking out wikipedia one time and we talked about how the quality of certain areas of articles were a little lacking He also told me about his tattered history on wikipedia where he had his user page edited without consent by SWD316 Moe Epsilon Then someone else vandalized SWD316 s user page and put the blame on mcfly which I m fairly sure he would not do Mcfly did make a few other accounts during a RFA as he was worried that if SWD316 would be given moderator powers that he would be unfairly banned And if you look at Mcfly85 s edit history he has made a wealth of good edits mainly proofreading issues but also a lot with NPOV stub sorting and even creating an article every once in awhile In my opinion even with all the alleged sockpuppet abuse mcfly85 has been a strong asset to wikipedia If it wasn t for this user as lot of previous errors and formatting mistakes would have gone unnoticed and would harm the quality of this site He had no intention of becoming a moderator but always intended to improve even if only slightly any article that was lacking quality I feel bad that the actions of Moe Elipson have pretty much caused mcfly my friend to lose trust in this site and he has since retired his name He did come back under another name and made some great edits but then was unfairly IMO banned for being a sockpuppet used abusively There is a difference between being a sockpuppet and trying to use a new name to get a fresh start But I am not mcfly85 I am fairly new to being a serious editor on wikipedia and I was just checking some various parts of the site I then noticed on the RFAs section that this familiar name came up and I saw mcfly s screenname in the questions answered by Moe Elpison I really didn t want other users have what happened to mcfly happen to them so I voted opposed which I am allowed to do as a user I do not feel that I unfairly influenced the voters I think the voting results would have been the same weather I had voted or not And I have never heard of Araxen and I did not create or am involved with that user That vote should not have counted I just wanted to explain my case to you I also question that Moe Elipson s user page may be in violation of the no personal attacks policy He calls McFly85 some very harsh names such as a stalker I think that content that bashes other users should be removed there is no place for that anywhere But thanks for asking I hope to keep making solid contibutions to the encyclopedia it s a fun hobby,Safe/Neutral

Response Sorry I never got to reply to to the message you left me on my talk page You can explain your comments all you want but the fact remains that wikipedia policy dictates that we discuss articles not users Make sure you stick to that in the future Additionally adding the unsourced tag to Iranian peoples is quite innapropriate A simple look at the page shows at least 12 sources not 0 as the tag implys Well what I was trying to explain is that I never make any personal statements about him with the exception of to promote a positive image of Iran and Iranians which as I explained later in the same section any person assuming good faith would take as an insult You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one personally pointing me out by name I never did anything comparable to this Is this in accordance with your policy of we discuss articles not users As for the unsourced tag it s been discussed in the talk page The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page The article is on Iranian peoples so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are Such a source has yet to be provided I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group that of Iranian peoples see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this I m not sure what s the best way to move on from here The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind but a lot of users are not being cooperative I d consider any advice or mediation Thanks,Safe/Neutral

Content Dispute I m going to try and mediate the Iranian peoples dispute here could you please post your arguments there and we ll try and come to an reasonable comprimise 1 Hi History section needs clarification while linguistically all of those people are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother I am pointing to the last paragraph of the history section It should be clarified Thanks Modern Persians themselves are a diverse group of peoples descended from various Iranian and indigenous peoples of the Iranian plateau including the Elamites Although all Persians are linguistically connected to each other ethnic backgrounds are diverse with many different cultural traits Would something like that be preferable to you Yes but the word Iranians instead of Persians Persians are by themselves a member of that linguistic group Ok I stand corrected I m not familiar with the topic matter at hand here I m googling trying to find information if nobody objects I propse changing the paragraph to the above it seems clearer to me No sorry this paragraph Thus not unlike the previous example of Germanic peoples involving the English who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin Iranian is an ethno linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and or cultural traits that denote their respective identities Here I meant Iranian peoples linguistically are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother so the claim refering to common ethnicity in the articler is not correct Ok is Germanic peoples involving the English who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin also an ethno linguistic group If so should we add only to Iranian is an ethno linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and or cultural traits that denote their respective identities The Iranian people Unlike gernmanic people are from quite different etnicities like Turkic Persian and others uncertain The whole sentence is wrong and POV we should drop the word common ethnicity and clarify that it is only a linguistic term 2 The info box does not belong here Iranian peoples are not an ethnic group They are several different ethnicities speaking different languages It should be removed as in any other linguistic group I think you have a valid point there I would like to see the argument to the contrary before making a recomendation though 3 Aryan is a linguistic term that refers to an ancient language group that was ancestral to the Indo European family of languages http iml jou ufl edu projects Spring01 Millig,Safe/Neutral

Hey glad to hear from you This is Jazzy Admittedly I am extremely frustrated with user dcandeto and my actions have been less than perfect but I wrote an article for a journalism class on a well known guy named Cody Hedman and Dcandeto hounded on it until it was deleted I felt I did not get ample time to discuss the article before it was taken down I admit I made several accounts trying to get around dcandeto Firstly I created Cdub1985 a run off of the guy I wrote about and then jazzy 006 jazzy 007 and I got my friends to try and keep it on Honestly my attacks against dcandeto have been stupid and anger motivated and attempting to delete his article was an act of frustration but I do not feel he asserted the importance of the writer he wrote about Honestly what I wrote was not a vanity article and I just thought it would be cool to have an article on wiki but the way I was so quickly attacked and had nothing explained to me was unreasonable and I retaliated You know I treated dcandeto bad but I feel he should be more understanding and helpful towards newcomers instead of trying to delete work ASAP Thanks Jazzy,Attacking Behavior

And nobody has PROVED the accuracy of the article The part about Gwen not being able to pass was culled from many people that knew Gwen well and stated that Gwen could not pass In the Rolling Stone article it was mentioned that Gwen could not get a job because of her visible transgendered status in other words that she was clearly a biological male Most Photos of Gwen look to be a biological male made up as a female You can insist over and over that this is not the case but it clearly is Gwen was also attacked weeks before by people who clearly recognized her tyransgendered status Yet we are supposed to believe that almost everyone Gwen came into contact with knew she was transgendered until she met up with these three men and their group of friends Somehow they were magically oblivious to what most others can clearly see QUOTE That doesn t make her dangerous behavior a way to wink and say well she got what she deserved QUOTE I NEVER implied that Gwen deseved to be murdered and that is a sick contention of your part Gwen clearly engaged in behavior that put her at great risk of someone raping killing or beating her When the Transgendered do not have a support system in place and by that I mean qualified professionals as well as understanding friends and family they are at great risk Gwen s family as well as friends were no doubt sympathetic and loving but Gwen had no other support or therapy Gwen should have been in a support group at the very least and perhaps been transitioning after therapy before attempting to passing in public which is very dangerous in most places no matter how passable the person is or believes themselves to be Yes these guys are scum and thats even more reason to take any motivation they claim with a grain of salt But the bottom line is Gwen should have been more cautious And lets honsetly answer the question once and for all Was Gwen wrong in not revealing her gender status before having anal sex with some of these men And it has been widely reported that it was anal not oral sex I find it impossible to believe that if it was indeed oral sex that not one of these purported hetrosexual males made a boob grab This whole situation does not pass the smell test,Attacking Behavior

In fact rather than wait here s my complaint To whom it may concern Hi My name s Jim Heller and I m currently and for some time now caught up in a series of edit wars with Jossi Fresco The background is this I am a former follower of Prem Rawat a k a Maharaji a person I believe is a nefarious cult leader Fresco on the other hand is a current follower and needless to say of a different mind altogether For some years now ever since the advent of the internet Rawat and his followers have engaged in a long standing campaign to whitewash Rawat s past and somehow protect him from the harsh light of history The latest flashpoint arose just today when I tried to edit a Wikipedia article of another of Rawat s current followers a religious studies professor in fact Ron Geaves who by the way just shot to flashpan infamy as the English academic who opined that the July 7th bombers were demonstrators not terrorists Please excuse the fact that to explain the problem in any meaningful way I have to flesh out the context somewhat My edit concerned an academic not Wikipedia article Geaves had written where discussing a program Rawat held in 1973 he wrote that In November 1973 Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90 000 The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U S with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji s appearance at the stadium as a second coming complete with angelic and alien visitors Only 20 000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers expectations He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises My emphasis here and below In fact a widely disseminated invitation to that same 1973 program Maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the millenial expectations but fanned the flames substantially Thus he declared the program the most Holy and significant event in human history and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significance A LETTER FROM GURU MAHARAJ JI Bonn Germany September 31 1973 Dear premies First of all I would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us Because we have realized this beautiful Knowledge which is of great bliss to us all it is our duty to propagate it to the human race For it is something they really need In the world there is suffering hatred and dissatisfaction That fact does not need proof It is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment No one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this The world is looking for the Perfect Master to come and reveal the Perfect Knowledge of God There is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the Perfect Masters coem to reveal this Knowledge to people We can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace for peace lies inside not outside in materialism As you all know Millenium 73 is being prepared for now This festival has been organized by Divine Light Mission each year since 1967 in the memory of the late Satgurudev Shri Hans Ji Maharaji on His birthday This year the most Holy and significant event in human history will take place in America I think that Millenium 73 is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of Truth Consciousness and Bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner To do this I really need your help I really need the help of all the premies in all respects physically financially and all other ways to make Millenium 73 come off This is a festival not for you or me It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe I hereby invite you to this Divine Festival of Peace Millenium 73 and request all premies to help me financially physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of Truth Isn t it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this Earth Blessings to you all Sant Ji Maharaj It is clear when you contrast Geaves claim with the documentary evidence that Geaves bless his heart is playing the role of the typical cult apologist lying about his leader and blaming the followers the press anyone at all for the inexcusable laughable excesses of the cult What s particularly worrying about Geaves I m sure you can appreciate is that as a religious studies professor he s imbued with a certain authority that,Attacking Behavior

Serbian casualties again Just one link more to the already existing ones numbered above http www aimpress ch dyn trae archive data 199711 71128 026 trae beo htm It is perfectly understandable for Serbian apologists to try to minimize the Serbian death toll in battles civilian Serbian casualties are as usual inflated beyond beyond The reason High military casualties figure speaks of Serbian military incompetence as contrasted to their self image of a Ramboid nation also it is a sign of heavy Yugoslav involvement in agression on Croatia Anyone s national sensibilities aside it is clear that all realiable and available sources put the Serbian military death toll at the lowest level of 8 000 The article is signed by Stipe Sikavica a typical Croatian name so it again represents a Croatian press POV Here s another nice example of nationalist logic What you re basically saying is that this journalist cannot possibly be objective because he is Croatian is that it Infact you are drawing this conclusion solely out of the man s NAME What if he changed his name maybe he would be more neutral then what do you think Even in that link you could not see that anyone from serbian side states something like 10 000 According to Serbian sources regarding the number of Serbian soldiers who died or went missing during all the wars in Slovenia Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina the number often mentioned is 2 300 and most of them around a half are believed to have died in the battle for Vukovar The cited article states also that most experts agree with the figure There are no reason to put 8 000 or 10 000 as official data These data are contraversial Croatian sources ie general Anton Tus put the Serbian military casualties figure around 10 000 Other sources like brigadier general Mile DedakoviÄ in his book Bitka za Vukovar put the highest limit around 12 000 Therefore chief Croatian estimates revolve around 10 k Serbian military casualties This page is not about what Serbian sources say exclusively Without going into details of questionable veracity of Serbian sources re this battle the most correct approach is to state what both sides have to say And in the cited article by a journalist named Sikavica it is clear for anyone who is not deaf blind and mute that some Serbian military figures agree with general Tus s estimates It is explicit Therefore reverted I ve seen this later It s not just the number of Serbian military casualties after all these were mainly puzzled conscripts sent to the slaughterhouse It s this sick worldview prevalent in some Serbian circles Croatian paramilitaries secession liberation of Vukovar then liberation of Srebrenica faked Markala lies about everything and everyone for those conversant with Croatian just a slice http www hic hr books jugoistocna europa dedijer htm kraj 20mita,Attacking Behavior

13 April 2006 UTC Hi Heah Thanks for your reply First I wrongly assumed that Jossi had started the deletions He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting I didn t know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward I still maintain however that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism They weren t corroborative edits that s for sure They were as I said wholesale repeated deletions of original text You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but in this case I can assure you that s not the problem Jossi s full aware of the fact that both Geaves comments and Rawat s own contradictory words in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival are proven and accurate Here s a link to the Geaves article Footnote 5 is the one where Geaves relieves Rawat of any knowledge or responsibility for the Millenium hype And here s a link to the letter Rawat himself wrote which clearly puts the lie to Geaves revisionism The Wiki rule about vandalism states that most is dealt with by fast reversions However it doesn t say that persistent efforts in this regard may nonetheless violate the three reversion rule and trigger blocking It does seem a little Kafak esque don t you think Finally on the more general complaint I have about Jossi Fresco I do invite you to take some time if you would and review his editing of the Rawat articles He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader a man who still has many many followers who believe that he is God in human form Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man The fact that he s a Wikipedia administrator is worrying in my opinion 18 13,Attacking Behavior
Don t worry it was just a typo with brackets omitted a frequent case with the longer sentences or those involving a few disparate concepts Also the quotation marks were intentional because ustaÅ e were not negative nor positive it was a historical reaction of the part of the Croatian nationalist movemnent to the years of the Serbian oppression To define it as negative would be as absurd to define Soviet Communism the most murderous regime on earth as negative or positive Those Croats and Bosnian Muslims who volunteered to take part in the UstaÅ ka vojnica more than 40 000 people in 1943 cannot be labelled as war criminals nor as traitors as anti Croat propaganda would have it in the Communist Yugoslavia period The pathological murderers like Maks LuburiÄ or totalitarian dictators like Ante PaveliÄ cannot cast the shadow on all the participants in the UstaÅ a military forces any more than Joseph Mengele or Adolf Hitler can contaminate the memory of German soldiers particularly Waffen SS who fought in the WW2 This is even more true about ordinary people or intellectuals who participated in the NDH regime for instance Adolfo Bratoljub KlaiÄ the author of famous dictionary of foreign words or the sculptor AugustinÄ iÄ who made a bust of PaveliÄ but later switched sides Do I have to repeat The NDH was a quisling state The vast majority of people involved with it and working for it were neither quislings nor criminals And this is just the NDH talk Let s not forget that as far as resistance movement goes the Croats were the majority both in leadership and in fighting forces who were not forced to join the resistance like the Serbs in the NDH but did it out of ideals And in the percentage of participation heavily outnumbering other nations in ex Yugoslavia except pehaps Montenegrins http www hercegbosna org engleski ww2 html Hmmm I haven t seen anything that would refute the claim that Serbian propagandists are vandalizing not a few wikipedia pages solely with the aim of spreading anti Croat chauvinist hatred,Attacking Behavior

What would you do Xerox pages of a book I unlike you read 2 years ago And which proves what That in StarÄ eviÄ s political career the term Slavosrb was used exclusively for enemies as he saw them of Croatian independence The main Slavosrbs were Strossmayer Germans Hapsburg monarchy and the so called Khuen Serbs the Serbs living in Croatia and affilliated with the hated political regime of oppression How come that vast majority of political representatives of Serbs in Croatia more than 98 had been during the most oppressive period in the 19th century collaborators of Khuen regime Truly these Serbs or Orthodox Vlachs who nationally awoke as Serbs in mid and 2nd half of the 19th century had fully deserved the Slavosrbs tag in StarÄ eviÄ s lingo unlike the descendandts of Orthodox Vlachs who were StarÄ eviÄ s followers Stjepan MiletiÄ August HarambaÅ iÄ DuÅ an Kotur DuÅ an VlaisavljeviÄ Milan OgrizoviÄ No one can rationally deny anyone s ethnic affiliation this is certain The fact that StarÄ eviÄ did this to the descendands of the Orthodox Vlachs is not a sign of political wisdom or even ordinary logic But it must be underscored that he reacted to the denial of Croatian ethnic affiliation promulgated by Vuk KaradÅ¾iÄ s pan Serbian ideology And this must not be forgotten who had begun with this game of denial Who wanted another people s extirpation Whose idenmtity was forged among other things upon cultural theft and misappropriations Who spoiled the well http www hic hr books greatserbia,Attacking Behavior

Dealing with Geaves trustworthiness as a Rawat scholar Rather than get into another reversion war I ll do it this way I propose posting the same paragraph I put up the other day Obviously you premies don t like it but the fact is it s apparent beyond question that Geaves has misrepresented the truth about Rawat s role in the Millenium hype Geaves said In November 1973 Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90 000 The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U S with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji s appearance at the stadium as a second coming complete with angelic and alien visitors Only 20 000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers expectations He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises Whereas in a broadly disseminated letter to all his followers Rawat described the upcoming program as the most Holy and significant event in human history intimated that the festival wasn t just for him and his followers but the whole world and maybe the whole universe and suggested that it was time for his followers to help him bring peace to this Earth Any fair reader can clearly see the serious discrepancy between Geaves account and the documentary evidence,Attacking Behavior

the real discussion is not about m z or m q but it is about wether the mass to charge ratio is a physical unit of dimension mass charge or wether it is a dimensionless unit As someone who is interested in physics you may understand that I have real problems seeing a dimensionless m z on the mass to charge ratio page It is the equivalent to have for example the electronic charge in the article of the electric current This is the problem that I think you re either misunderstanding or too stubborn about your POV to accept Whether or not you want to discuss the usage of m z it still is accepted by IUPAC which btw is not in any way a minority but reflects majority opinion amongst chemists The wiki entries on notations standards units and the like should reflect nothing other than what bodies like IUPAP IUPAC and ISO etc deicide I think you ll at least concede that your particular view about m z is far more of a minority position than that of IUPAC s Because I agree with you I said that you should be allowed the opportunity to add a brief explanation of why there may be confusion along with a discussion of other units and to add an external link to any reputable journal where there has been a discussion of the problems of m z The most recent edit still looks like an attempt to completely discredit the concept of m z altogether which is still your POV Please keep the rest of the discussion about this mediation on the mediation page,Attacking Behavior

Follow up You reduce false rape claims to people women changing their minds But if rape is sex without consent it does not require anyone changing his mind It can be people feeling ambivalent or curious beforehand Ambivalence or curiousity do not imply consent Cooperation does not imply consent And you cannot prove consent unless you have maybe signed a consent form into which you could have been tricked coerced to sign Don t you see the huge plunge into plain old fashioned insanity the legal system takes when rape is sex without consent I am aware that it is hard for women to get rape claims heard etc I am aware of that What I am trying to explain to you is this is exactly the result of exaggerated rape claims If rape was just a special form of assault there would not be little misunderstanding to what constitutes a rape and what not This would serve the potential victims as well as everybody else especially the legal system and the police I am not familiar enough with the example of South Africa that you bring up From experience if a statisticly huge drop like 60 in a short time for something that is greatly influenced by social mores which usually take 50 to 150 years to change then this is most likely caused by a change in the way the figures are obtained You bring up the example of date rape not being covered by the definition of sex by force You have some pretty messed up ideas Drugs are force For example the police tries to use knock out gas to remedy certain hostile situations and they refer to these gases as non lethal force Similiar to another example where people are just holding you down not hurting you to rape you holding someone down by force is force Locking someone up in a basement only to offer food and water in exchange for sexual service is also using force if you have thought about bringing that example up The second half of your post mostly rambles about how expensive guns are Yes they are way too expensive but the reason for them being expensive has a lot to do with government regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of firearms As for an unsightly bulge when carrying a weapon I ve got some more unsightly bulges than that and women tend carry purses perfect for concealed carry So women have an easier time to carry guns God I want it to be socially acceptable for men to carry a purse But then again it looks like total ass Every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times Because violence is the very foundation of a state The state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people and instead claims a monopoly on violence and resolves disputes with a legal system and enforces the laws with an armed police force But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse totalitarian laws dictatorships Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose that is the well being of the citizens and replace it with a new government preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line As such any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly,Attacking Behavior

Compare it to other pictures of Lee Oswald Fabricating pictures was quite primitive in 1963 Look at another Oswald picture on the page Which viewpoint does the reader believe Is the Big Chin a sign of a fake or not Gamaliel will now try to change the subject and won t directly discuss the Big Chin We ve already discussed the Big Chin to death It was one of many allegations of photo manipulation dismissed by the HSCA You want to mention it as if 1 it was never debunked 2 it s the most important thing ever 3 it is proof of conspiracy Gamaliel none of the three things you just wrote make any logical sense 1 Some believe the chin is not a fabrication So what This doesn t mean these true believers have debunked something Its their opinion The policy of this web site is to provide all opinions and certainly not to hide the evidence When are you going to understand this rule 2 How important is it It is relevant to Oswald s contention that some one was framing him Whether that is the most important thing ever is up to the reader 3 Whether it is proof of a conspiracy is also up to the reader Gamaliel your frantic attempts to delete and hide any information that you disagree with is directly contrary to the web site rules Why do you continue to do it Don t forget there were two Oswald s Lee Oswald and Harvey Oswald One worked for the CIA and was the real triggerman I forget which But wait a minute the fatal shot really came from the grassy knoll from an anti Castro Cuban who wanted payback for no air support for Brigade 2506 during the Bay of Pigs disaster No wait a minute Oswald was a paid hitman for the mafia oh well It s 3 37 in the AM all this conspiracy stuff is making me loopy Goodnight Gamaliel is this person above who calls himself Mytwocents your alter ego and put in for comic relief Web site rules of inclusion of all significant viewpoints The evidence of the fabricated photograph is a significant viewpoint that was discussed in the HSCA report Some experts believe it shows fabricationsome don t Under the rules of this web site all significant viewpoints should be presented Claiming that someone else disagrees with a significant viewpoint on a subject is not a ground for excluding it from the article Arguing it is not the most important thing ever is not a ground for excluding the view point that the photographs are fabrications Arguing that evidence that the photographs were fabricated is evidence of a conspiracy is not a ground for excluding the evidence Gentlemen These are basic web site rules Leave this article in a readable state Don t leave after every goddamn sentence in a paragraph Use one tag Free free to argue about content but make sure the current content is at least readable I have just fixed a couple of paragraphs I m about to go after any others You should control your anger Content that is both controversial and unreferernced should be taken out Do that instead Control my anger What are you talking about I m not in a position to verify either way I just want to make sure that the article is readable for the users This article is not neutral Surely it s not the job of Wikipedia contributors to decide whether or not Oswald worked alone was part of a conspiracy or had anything to do with the assassination at all It seems to me that the only way of rendering a neutral article is to state that Oswald was arrested and held on suspicion of Kennedy s murder but was killed before he could be tried It can then be provably stated that the Warren Commission in its Report concluded that Oswald was guilty and had worked alone but that there have since been many efforts and arguments that attempt to disprove this conclusion It s not our business to decide what really happened which is what some people here are trying to do We are here to report on and check verifiable facts not persuade peop,Attacking Behavior

1 Croats had according to the DAI been a fighting folk who subdued Avars repelled Franks and saved Serbs from Bulgarian captivity 2 Serbs were a docile folk who essentially didn t fight their place under the sun Their very name signified servitude of a sort as evidenced by the DAI s etymology They lost every battle with foreigners they ever fought placed themselves under Byzantine suzerainty amd were saved from extinction by Croats who crushed Bulgarian aggression 3 there are historical documents galore which testify about Croatian legal parliamentary and cultural continuity from the times of Trpimir and KreÅ imir to the later corpora 4 Croatian language heritage in the vernacular is well attested in from the 13th century on at least They Croatian name is explicitly mentioned in various sources both ÄŒakavian and Å tokavian particularly in Dalmatia Dubrovnik and Bosnia Moreover linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary mid 19th century Croatian language On the other hand Serbian written works up until Dositej and Vuk 1780 1820 were written exclusively in Church Slavic language Serbian literature until Vuk is essentially a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area Hence Vuk s linguistic pan Serbism which tried to appropriate all Å tokavian vernacular literature is evidently a falsity and concoction 5 early Slavic studies Å araÅ ik et al were deluded in ascribing parts of the Croatian literature to the Serbian heritage 6 Serbian ethnic affiliation in modern terms is a relatively new phenomenon in Croatia The major part of Eastern Orthodox inhabitants of Croatia who actively participated in the Croatian cultural life Illyrian movemont have begun to show Serbian national allegiance only in recent 1850s years Virtually all StarÄ eviÄ s claims are corroborated by historical sources available at his times Whether the veracity of historical sources like the DAI can withstand the test of time this is another question But from the vantage point of mid 19th century clash of Serbian and Croatian ideologies StarÄ eviÄ polemic stands as an example of skilled sometimes sardonic and always truthful debate without distortions lies or misappropriations Sarcasm hurts but this is what the polemic is all about,Attacking Behavior

Alright First to your analysis Information darwinism is the opposition to pig headedness Bring me the right arguments and I will be convinced as anyone should be But failing to do so you cannot convince me You cannot convince me by begging threats bullying bribing and whatever else you can think of Only the argument is what counts What s right is not defined by the mainstream opinion If 2000 years ago people largely figured slavery was the right thing or that the earth was flat or that violent computer games turn people into mass murderers that doesn t make it anyhow right The truth is not found by a demoscopic process but instead by an organic darwinistic process that Information darwinism tries to understand and act in accordance with I do consider your thoughts on the subject flawed on a deeper level Part of our problem to communicate is certainly because of the limitations of language When we use words and you understand certain words to have a different meaning than how I understand them e g Force then we can not engage in a proper dialogue without first sorting out the terminology required So if you do find that I use a word in a different way than how you would use it or anything else weird request from me a definition of the term This is purely the linguistic barrier that must be overcome Now to some items that I seem to have brushed over The data suggest rape victims suffer more psychological trauma than other victims of assault What data By what standards Someone beaten into a bloody pulp robbed or whatever may well suffer more severe psychological trauma than someone who is victim to rape by lax standards These are problems rooted in terminology If you want us to waste literally weeks to figure out the truthfulness of the statement rape victims are off worse than regular assault victims then I have to say no thanks Because as a categorical statement I can tell you right away that is false You claim to want rape treated simply as assault in one instance and then go and suggest it should be a special form of assault which it is It is a special form of assault That does not mean it needs to be treated with different standards than other specicific better terminology forms of assault Assault with a gardening rake is also a special form of assault that doesn t mean it has to be treated fundamentally different from assault with a pitchfork Again terminology appears to be the problem Having rape as a separate category of crime allows for special systems to be in place for victims and court systems This is not something that I have brushed over That is what you appear to be in favor of I disagree strongly If someone s victim of a criminal offense he should not be treated specially that is not like other victims of criminal offenses Otherwise you are just asking for rape victims being ridiculed by society police legal system while non sexual assault victims get treated fairly I claim that only if there is no legal difference between sexual assault and non sexual assault that sexual assault victims and perpetrators can be treated fairly as everyone would wish Who do you actually propose giving these weapons to How exactly is it my job to decide who should get weapons I would assume similiar standards to car ownership and gun ownership should be applied Both cars and guns are extremely dangerous in the wrong hands lethal weapons you might say but both serve an useful purpose Security and Transportation I do not think that anyone should be denied the right to own a handgun And I certainly do not credit a state institution with the rights to decide who gets to own one and who doesnt But what exactly are you asking me for Elaborate the legislature of my dreams I don t see sense in asking me that Well there you have it Basically all of the issues I have brushed over in your mind come down to linguistic issues terminology and the such The answers are irrelevant as they can never be given without a ludicrous amount of detail given to the questions I ve known this This is one of the underlying problems that you have You fail to identify different uses of terminology and resolve them accordingly But I would suspect that we have even deeper still disagreements on very many things than just the attitude of resolving conflicts of terminology This is why I suspect your methodology of thinking is deeply flawed rather than my own And that is why I tried to tell you You first need to get your shit straight before we can argue on actual subjects like rape legislature and social consequences thereof in a productive manner I assume you will misunderstand many of the things I said in this post right,Attacking Behavior

Right Well here s what I ve done just now Changed section heading modern philosophy to philosophical topics to move the article more in line with Lac s proposal The text there still reads in a historical sort of way but that shouldn t distract the presentation of the broader themes and ideas presented A single paragraph in the philosophical topics section was transferred a section up into the historical section under the subheading modern western philosophy A bit of text in the rationalism empiricism subsection misleadingly implied that Locke was a naturalist and Hume the first empiricist This is obviously wrong so I changed it Something problematic the sentence During this era religious philosophy did not play a large role in the struggles that occupied secular philosophy is either misleading assuming secular philosophy to mean not on the face of it pertaining to issues of God etc or trivially true assuming the same to mean completely non religious philosophy Assuming the former and assuming we take this era to mean the Modern era it counts as a counter example that Descartes was completely religious that God was his one of his clear and distinct solutions to the dilemmas in the Meditations Locke s generally secular outlook on politics had great stake in religion the man thought atheists were not to be trusted and was at pains to advocate religious toleration on grounds that did not have to admit the fallibility of religion The more stark example of Berkeley already mentioned in the text is an understatement it is not just his disputes with Newton but rather absolutely anything that Berkeley said which could not be divorced from his religious views including his theory of vision Malebranche is another example It s my impression that there wasn t a genuine cooling off from appeals to religion until the late modern period So I recommend the sentence be scrapped,Safe/Neutral

TVTimes images Hi Ben You ve recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine You ve correctly tagged them as fair use magazine but I don t think the images are being used under fair use considerations The tag for fair use magazines says It is believed that the use of low resolution images of magazine covers to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question The images are being used to illustrate programmes not the TVTimes magazine Therefore I d say they re not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia s fair use copyrights policy Additionally the tag says To the uploader please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use as described on Wikipedia Image description page as well as the source of the work and copyright information These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don t provide the source of the work scan taken from another website etc I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you ve put them in but I d be interested in hearing your views Thanks âž â REDVERSâ ž Your quibbles of fair use are so much ridiculous pedantry and if this is the level of petty officiousness you subscribe to here I d sooner not bother Fuck you cunt,Attacking Behavior

A hit list for Jews There is a site called Jew Watch out there I ll let you find the link which specialises in keeping an eye on Jewish activities It is used as a reference site by anti semites the world around Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not under any circumstances list someone who they cannot confirm 100 is Jewish Stormfront a white supremist web forum uses Jew Watch all of the time The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch It is a criteria designed for anti semites It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews Jewish communities do not have such a criteria They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community through race religion or culture This is the normal criteria that is used If your father is Jewish then per Jewish community standards you are Jewish And so forth Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability But these criteria are not being applied to this list This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists this is plainly not true If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews then this list shouldn t exist at all And we should especially not try to focus on who are the real Jews Wikipedia are changing their rules purely to push an anti semetic point of view And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo nazis and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers who have written vehement anti semetic text throughout Wikipedia Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists Slim Virgin is an anti semite Right now I would encourage deletion of this list It is being run by anti semites and used to harm all Jewish people Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages it is dangerous to continue to have such a page It is encouraging hatred of Jews,Attacking Behavior

How not to vandalize Recently Timothy Usher has made repeated attempts to unilaterally remove content without consensus I ve reverted these and will continue to do so within the limits of 3RR If Tim wants to make major changes such as these mass deletions he s going to need to get a consensus here first If he does I will honor it,Attacking Behavior

Someone please totally copyedit this Scientists occasionally invent hypothetical entities with special abilities as part of a thought experiment These demons have abilities that are nearly limitless but they are still subject to the physical laws being theorized about For example in Descartes Second Meditation it is argued as a thought experiment that it is at least possible that there is an all powerful evil demon who is deceiving me such that this demon causes me to have false beliefs including the belief that there is an object before me and the belief that two plus three equals five Note that the power of such a demon would be two fold both empirical and rational thinking can be completely compromised This leads to a worrisome argument 1 One knows some fact or other only when one can rule out that there is such a demon 2 But one can never be in a position rule out that there is such a being since we can never be sure that the demon isn t merely toying with our epistemic situation 3 Thus we can never know any facts at all I hate it when people need to be slammed in the face WIKIPEDIA IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA NOT A COLUMN I was too lazy to understand what it reads there so please someone if that is a joke or something too lazy to think right now then remove it I guess,Attacking Behavior

Unethical actions by an admin named The context of the supposed WP NPA violation is highly relevant My comment was made in response to an ideologically motived 3RR violation report filed against me Since that wasn t working for him Nandesuka figured I needed to be silenced which is why he dug through the history and found this excuse after the fact Note that Nandesuka shouldn t even be involved in this in any official capacity since he s an admin who has had many content disputes with me over his unalloyed support for cirumcising all penises As a member of the Snippies he is too biased to participate in this case and his actions show that he s a sore loser who is abusing his newly gained admin rights to silence me so that I can t defend myself from the charges of 3RR violation I request that this block be removed so that I can correct false statements being made in my 3RR report and clear my good name Thank you for your prompt response,Attacking Behavior
His edits do suck which is why I reverted them over and over again Not one edit contributed positively to the article and most served the needs of the Crusaders In any case I ve pointed out that my comment about him sucking was reverted by me immediately It is my practice to write honestly then go back and edit myself before submitting In this I missed one spot and had to edit it after submitting as I mentioned in my edit comment Since nobody saw the original unless they dug through the history and since nobody ever needed to warn me about it your excuses are nonsense You just wanted to silence me so I couldn t defend myself from the ideologically motivated 3RR violation report Even before you got a badge you have made it a practice to litter my user page with spurious warnings which has earned you the honor of being the only person whose text I erase on sight from my Talk page You are a stalker Since you are the guilty party your response here is not sufficient I would like an objective third party to respond regarding this abusive block by you,Attacking Behavior

The rules against incivility and personal attacks are great in principle but it only takes a little bit of misinterpretation for them to be twisted into a weapon against all disagreement Witness this case where you are penalizing me for saying that Deskana would be an incompetent admin I stand by this assertion he lacks the skills necessary to do the admin job I also stand by the assertion that there are others out there who became admins but are likewise incompetent To penalize me for even expressing my views is to stifle all debate and turn Wikipedia into a censored environment In short your reasoning is suspect as is your competency You were required to rule on an existing block not search my Talk page for unrelated material that you can use to justify it Calling someone actually or potentially incompetent is a reasoned conclusion not a personal attack In contrast your thin skinned response is in violation of the spirit of free inquiry that drives Wikipedia Since you did not attempt to do your job I will once again raise the flag in hopes of a more competent admin noticing Your services however will no longer be required Jareth You can join Nandesuka on my short list of admins who have proven their incompetence,Attacking Behavior

It depends how you define World The war which commenced in 1939 was only between European states while the two most industrially powerful countries on the globe USA and Soviet Union were not at war It only becomes an actual world war in 1941 It could be rationally argued that if the war had ended before 1941 before the USA and SU got involved then it would just have been called the European War or the Great Nazi War or the Anglo Franco German War or something similar It is difficult to see why a war which leaves out the two most powerful countries on Earth could in any real sense be called a world war And I am writing this as a European Still the war has to be called something and once it became a world war in 1941 then the name could retrospectively be applied to the fighting which preceded it,Safe/Neutral

Genesis and the Hebrew Bible While it is certainly true that the Book of Genesis in the Christian Bible corresponds exactly to the book named Bereshit in the Hebrew Bible I think it is incorrect to say that the story of the Ark is contained in the Hebrew Bible s book of Genesis chapters 6 to 9 If you are going to reference the Hebrew Bible call it Bereshit but because that name is lesser known I think it is better to say it is contained in the Christian Bible s book of Genesis or better still contained in the Bible s book of Genesis since it is in both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible I d change it myself but I d rather not have to fight down the objections so I m explaining it instead You make a good point I ll change it to the biblical book of Genesis Someone s already done it,Safe/Neutral

Hi there A little background on me was initially diagnosed with depression in 2007 and was medicated for it up until July 2014 I ve been on a plethora of medications that always stop working for me after about 2 years of use Most recently I was on Lexapro and Abilify Started therapy shortly after diagnosis of depression because I didn t want to take medication but then after being tossed around by multiple therapists I sucked it up and started solely taking medication avoiding therapy at all costs I was diagnosed with BPD a year or so later but no one really told me anything about it and by that time I was through with therapy not that I had any BPD specific resources at the time anyway and I only told future psychiatrists that I had major depression because I didn t quite understand BPD I quit taking the antidepressants because I thought I had finally moved past that part of my life that made me depressed and I was fine for a good 5 months I finally committed to a relationship but it ended shortly after it began due to my partner keeping SO many things from me until a few days after I caught him cheating on me when he unloaded every single thing he kept from me in a letter To say I was overwhelmed would be an understatement I have never been absolutely blindsided in a relationship before and it has sent me plummeting back into a very serious depression I ve been staying unusually busy these past 4 weeks trying to distract myself from getting sucked back in but now that s not even working I must also add that I met a Redditor from meetups I started going to within the last month that has a lot of experience with an ex that is BPD who I ve been intimate with He has issues himself but I m starting to feel as if he is exacerbating my problems because I feel like I don t need to hide my emotions or actions when I m around him due to his experience with BPD I literally do not even attempt to control myself As much as I do NOT want to go back on medication it s definitely the lesser of two evils rivalrying therapy for me But I do want feedback on therapy options from you all I have such an incredible lack of trust in therapists that I can t see myself going back and to even further that I probably can t afford frequent enough sessions for my treatment Plus all the psychiatrists I sought just before Christmas can t see me for at least 3 months So I have no idea what to do I d really like to avoid inpatient but the suicide ideation is starting to get bad Oh and did anyone else see the study regarding a high EPA fish oil component dose and great BPD symptom reduction Anyone tried it Lastly I need advice on what I should do about this new person in my life I m torn because I appreciate his thoughts and definitely appreciate his company but I m really beginning to think that this is the LEAST appropriate thing to involve myself in with me being as unstable as I am currently Plus I have no friends nearby except for him that I trust enough to talk to I m afraid that I ve met my complaining quota with my long distance friends and I do NOT do well alone I live alone as well Thanks for reading my novella and thanks in advance for any advice you can provide,Suicidal Reference
Hi First time here first time posting I ve had BPD diagnosis for around 7 or 8 years I only found out about it last spring I ve seen a psychiatrist from 9 years ago to 2 years ago two different kinds of therapists other one was horrible can t remember the type now 7 years ago for about 1 5years and cognitive psychotherapy two years with one year in between ended in Dec 2013 currently seeing a nurse once a month who really doesn t understand me at all I dislike her but am too tired with all this bs to ask for another took a BPD course last fall group therapy 10 times to inform us about schemas and states of mind and recently quit Venlafaxine had used for years noticed now that it caused me to have BED as it made me gain 12kg in 6 months when the dosage was upped and Lamictal I noticed by accident that it gives me severe head aches even after the starting period So I ve done the works tried to get better And I haven t I ve only gotten severely worse I ve lost all my friends Either by actually telling them to f ck off last time was 4 years ago I think After that I haven t had a real friend as I stopped trying to be friends with anyone as I had done that a couple times before or by alienating myself from everyone bit by bit People I thought were my true friends have gotten married without telling me separated and started new relationships new jobs etc They moved away I stayed to rot I hate my BF been together for 6 years have a 3 year old son Won t marry me since I m a psycho and obese way too often though mostly we re ok Today I broke up with him as I found out yet another one of my former friends had gotten married and it makes me hate myself I m not good enough to even be engaged I have another BF since I m in a polyamorous relationship and he made us talk told us it s not over I can t keep this coherent I m sorry I hate my life I don t have a job I ve never done anything worth anything Yeah I graduated from a uni but it doesn t give me a job I helped start a huge theater group as a student thing in the uni Yeah everyone else had fun I just did all the work Those worth nothing Zilch I m worth nothing I have no faith in ever getting better I ve tried to get help and it has done me nothing even got me worse I HATE people who tell me that BPD can be cured Either that is total BS or I m just so totally damaged that it will never ever be true on my case I guess the latter is right as I ve seen people get better from all sorts of stuff I ve driven myself out from three BPD forums as the people there started to disgust me with their you can get better just decide to start getting better you can do it only you can do it for yourself BS There is nothing that can cure me I just want to kill myself Started cutting today and hate myself as I m such a pathetic wimp that I can only make scrapes when I want to cut properly I can t kill myself because of my child But my life is a hell A fat disgusting worthless hell Help,Suicidal Reference
What I mean by that question is do you ever experience the extreme anger that can come on as a result of something but then have trouble expressing that anger to someone I have a lot of trouble disagreeing or arguing with people even though I feel like I need to and it s mostly because I m afraid that if I argue then people will think I m difficult or needy or dramatic Not to mention the way I always second guess myself and think that I m overreacting or that I m upset about something not real So what ends up happening is I internalize it and my anger almost always immediately becomes this worked up kind of sadness that I take out on myself because it feels like the thing that I m angry about wouldn t have happened if there wasn t something wrong with me I usually feel nauseous and my thoughts start racing and that s the time when I want to relapse into my eating disorder or cut myself I don t ACTUALLY want those things but when I m in the moment it feels like I do I know it would be better if I could just be ok with having an argument but I just don t know how to stand up for myself Ultimately I feel like I let myself get walked on and then I get angry at myself for that and it s just this horrible cycle Does anyone else feel that way or is it just me,Suicidal Reference

I just stumbled across this forum today in a desperate attempt to find some answers My boyfriend of 2 years just ended things with me for good this past week I am having a horrible time handling this breakup I can t eat go to work or stop crying I can t handle all the emotions I feel However I have said for a while prior to this breakup that I didn t want the relationship anymore when really I think I just wanted space and time but I threatened to leave on numerous occasions which really hurt my partner who has complex ptsd The entire relationship I was emotionally abusive and out of control and he did everything he could to stay by me We were engaged at one point In the beginning I was supportive and caring But after his father passed away I could no longer handle the intensity of the situation so I acted out was incredibly destructive and hurtful But he still stood by me It seems that whenever things were going well I couldn t just accept and handle that happiness and I had to destroy it by acting insane screaming hitting myself banging my head against the wall etc And even in the beginning I was so terrified of him leaving me that I couldn t even accept what I had Now he is talking to someone else overseas who he plans on dating soon He told me how can I expect someone to take the abuse I dish out constantly He s moved on and it is destroying me I just want him back and I want to be healthy and I feel so much guilt and remorse for not getting help before it was too late I just want him to love me but instead there s someone else that is what I used to be How can I cope,Suicidal Reference

of course he didn t We ve been broken up for a year now No contact going pretty well except every few months I unblock him to send a photo or news story that reminded me of him He won t meet me because I m crazy emotional while he s super rational we ve tried so many times and it never works we fight like cat amp dog but my heart can t stop missing him it really sux that he is content to live without me and I miss him so much So last night I text him a photo of a book was reading that he would like Ronda Rousey s book He replies back telling me about the book he s reading then I ask to meet up he says he can t tonight as his mate is over and he has an early start for boxing but maybe another day that it would be nice to see me but he can t see us getting back together again so it s probably a bad idea I just snap and demand to see him that night and will come over at 11pm once his mate goes He tells me not to I ignore him and say am on my way and he HAS to see me it must be now I know when our eyes lock his anger will fade and he will feel the love for me again like it always has before That s why he doesn t want to see me anymore because he knows if I m standing in front of him he won t be able to stay mad He gets pissed and says I need to stop being a crazy person he won t let me in and if I don t come over tonight he will meet me next Wednesday after work I m like Fuck that how can you let me wait for days you re so cruel and cold I need to see you NOW I need a hug goddammit Then I drive 20mins to his house and throw small stones at his window to try and get him to relent and let me in In my mind this is just like an 80s teen rom com or something it shows how passionate I am and how much he means to me I m a hipster this is just a funny retro throwback right Of course to normal rational people this is highly emotionally unstable behaviour and just not okay for a 32yr old girl to do He doesn t let me in and I leave dejected heart hurting feeling like the biggest fucking fool for making myself look so stupid He has ignored my last 6 texts He sees my crazy before and is angry now but it s better to be hatefully remembered than forgotten about though right The shame is strong today I want to move state to Melbourne for a fresh start because Sydney makes me want to hang myself It s been a year and everything reminds me of him the coincidences and signs are staring me in the face constantly and make me sad but guess he doesn t feel things the same way I do He can be content to live without me I need to accept that he is the Blake to my Amy this love will kill me if I let it Been trying so hard to overcome acting so stupid and desperate for this guy Am so ashamed today that I regressed so badly and suddenly My new medication effexor felt like it just started working recently my depression was lifting and finally seemed getting some control over my mind and felt so self aware and high functioning but guess I might need DBT more than I cared to admit Hate feeling so fucked up Thanks for listening,Suicidal Reference

To make a long story short I have been recently really been trying to turn my life around For many years I wasted my time staying in my room playing video games like League of Legends jacking off and never going out to socialize with friends I didn t exercise and was basically bulimic in my eating habits eat thousands of calories late at night stay up until 5am fasting the next day after sleeping until 3pm repeat I have cut a lot of unhealthy things out of my life I have quit gaming all together masturbation and porn shameless plug for r NoFap I don t stay up past 1am I am trying to wake up earlier I brush my teeth and floss every night now never did either for years I take cold showers and I am trying to decrease the amount of time I spend on Reddit and Youtube and I exercise daily All that said I lived a very instant gratification lifestyle before and it was unhealthy All of that is gone now I am more depressed and suicidal than ever before I have been spending more time with friends and been outside more but I feel as though the lows that I experience are extremely low and because I do not have any crutches of instant gratification that I relied on before it is harder to cope I am afraid that I will be irrational during these suicidal ideations and do something I will regret I am on a great track to improve my life and I am starting DBT soon but what should I do about my worsening depressive states despite and overall better life If I power through it will I emerge better on the other side TL DR I have cut out a lot of unhealthy dopamine giving activities in my life but because I don t have them to rely on anymore I am increasingly suicidal What can I do,Suicidal Reference
Hi there I have BPD My biggest problem is I have a tendency to overreact to frustration It makes me scream and lash out at the one person I love the most I feel like utter shit every time it happens I feel so guilty and horrible for lashing out at my lover and hurting her I have tried using different coping skills like grounding exorcises but it seems like when I m in the heat of the moment I have no control of my anger reactions At this point I ve been with my girlfriend for two years I am also a woman for reference and she has been so forgiving but I am so afraid that she will get sick of my constant outbursts and break up with me I had been doing a lot better for several months until I lost my job and have been suffering from depression low self esteem issues Stupid little things set me over the edge and I rage like a lunatic Every time this happens she gets so upset and thinks that I hate her I love her more than life itself and I hate making her feel like this I hate myself for not being able to control my anger I have tried explaining to her that I have BPD and that I don t hate her at all I just have poor impulse control and anger issues She doesn t seem to understand at all and I feel like maybe she would be better off without me I hate putting her through this I have been reading up on BPD how to use coping mechanisms and have even tried everything I can to let go of the root cause of my anger but I still have fits of rage when I get frazzled frustrated I guess I just need some advice or someone to talk to about this Please help I hate myself and how I overreact,Suicidal Reference
It s been a challenging year full of ups mostly downs and all sorts of crazy moods that comes with borderline but from the very beginning i was honest about my condition and my disorder with him and he has been super patient and supportive of my needs he s three and half years older than me so he s the mature one i guess and i mostly depend on him i think the codependency has been a bit stronger lately since my father passed away this month and it has made me even more unstable in my emotions but i think we both know that it s not really working anymore he s trying his best to understand and support me but my emotions and demands are really taking a toll on everyone and him as well he has work mon saturday and spends whatever time he has with me but it s not enough i do understand as i am writing this that i am in a more stable mindset and that i am starting DBT therpay very soon so that will help even though it will take a while before the therapy will begin to work honestly i am unsure of our relationship or what to really do he is trying his best and it s not enough but nothing is really ever enough with bpd i do understand that even if i move on to another partner it will be the same its hard on our loved ones too we both love each other and that is clear although most of the times it may seem like i am selfish and i dont express my gratitude since i am unable to really see through my depressed states i am lost grieving and just losing my own self it feels like the only way to end my pain is to die,Suicidal Reference
On mobile so I can t tag if a mod could for me that would be great Every year it s the same The summertime is amazing full of new love and fun and hope for the future But as the colder months approach things seem to fall apart Once again I ve found myself in a new relationship and things have been amazing for these three months I m so lucky to have this guy in my life but already I m slipping and I know I m fucking it up It feels like my life is closing in around me Every year I get older the time limit to get my shit together shortens and every year I get older I m never closer but I panic more It just makes me wonder if I ll ever get it right if I ll ever be sane enough to deserve love and a stable relationship If I ll ever learn to completely control my borderline symptoms even through the tough times Is it worth it To stay alive and repeat these cycles again and again Is there hope,Suicidal Reference

So has anyone ever felt like you are experiencing every emotion at once I m sitting here at work extremely figity trying to figure out why I feel the way I do I m excited mad sad confused full of energy and some others that I don t quite know how to put into words My mind is racing so fast I don t know how to format my thoughts into words I think it started with my roommate Before he moved in I had a tendency to flirt while we were drinking and then he d come over to my old place and it became sex and now that we re living together it s sex but also cuddeling afterward kisses on forehead holding hands held me through the night he s told me that he liked me that s mostly when we re drunk I can t tell if he s just telling me how he really feels because he s not as timid as he usually is sober or not All I know is that I m extremely confused because I don t know if I m seeing mixed signals or I m just wanting to be held And it s causing me to feel as if I m going backwards in this instead of getting better and it s like I m becoming as if I m losing control of myself and my emotions All I want to do is be held and every time i see him I feel lustful but also just want to hold hands I don t know After my last relationship 3 years ago I felt confused because the person that I was with for so long was leaving and I didn t want to be alone and that caused me to do terrible thigns to myself and also lose control of my emotions and I don t want to go down that road again Any body else feel this way or have any advice in how to help me through this,Suicidal Reference
I wish I could say that I ve never drunk driven before but that would be a lie I ve been a problem drinker for around 5 years and that coupled with living in a rural location means driving under the influence was a more frequent occurrence than I would have liked Honestly I was always going to be arrested for it it was just a matter of when and how I hope other BPDers understand that concept the concept of an event that was always meant to happen in your life because I m not sure I really understand why I feel it but I know I do I m not sure what happened last week I had been sober for two weeks but still felt awful I underestimated how much I had drank the night before tried to drive to an assessment for therapy an hour and a half away thanks NHS bumped into a car and came to from the alcohol in an ambulance No one including myself was hurt I was locked in a cell with no windows for 2 and a half days over the weekend and broke my year long no SH success by scratching the skin off my forearm until it bled I cried I slept I catastophised I have never felt more suicidal or more dehumanised than I felt in that cell shitting in the same room I had to eat and sleep I am on bail for a month pending an assessment of my mental health and circumstances to guide the judge on my conviction Best case is a ban from driving for 12 months which will make my life and work or lack of work much much harder than it already is And BPD makes it pretty fucking hard I went on pre booked holiday an hour after I got out of court meeting friends for dinner and staying with my boyfriend in a hotel for a few nights The latter told me I am one of the cleverest people he knows but the person who does the most stupidest shit Neither him or my Mum and Dad seemed very surprised about the news of my arrest Perhaps they knew it would happen at some point too I wasn t feeling too bad about it for a while I was trying to keep busy with volunteering and friends and work trying to act like it didn t happen and go back to what I was doing during my two week sober streak but I just read something that made the feelings of failure come flooding back I was a student when I began my drinking journey During that time I was on placement and felt like a failure from the very beginning The two students who did my placement before me were high achievers and went on to get distinctions and jobs whereas I was drinking a bottle of vodka a day and struggling not to slash my arms with scalpel blades and meet random men for degrading and violent sex I still managed to graduate with an MA with merit but I ve been pretty much unemployed ever since due to alcohol and BPD shit The one project I was proud of as a student was continued by the girl who took over from me and she s just been nominated for an award for it I was always so career driven always so focused on my education and job and suddenly everything comes crashing down Suddenly it s all hit me I m only working part time I m educated but I m on benefits I ve lost my car for at least a year I m obviously not as talented as the girl who took over from me or the people who went before me once again I m unable to expose my forearm due to infected scabs that would make most people recoil in horror and I knows that most of that isn t true I know I was battling a lot during my placement and it s an achievement to have got to where I am with BPD I know I ve actually done a lot since graduating even if it s not official employment I know that success is measured in more than awards I know that this is my first arrest and everyone is allowed to make mistakes especially people who aren t in a good place mentally I know it s great that I have such a supportive group of people in my life I know it s great that I m still working and planning ahead despite what just happened I KNOW these things to be true but god damn I don t believe a single fucking one of them I m not sure if this post has a point A vent I guess Perhaps I want to hear from others who ve been arrested perhaps I m hoping someone will tell me my feelings of failure aren t valid perhaps I want someone to tell me I am a failure I m not sure All I know is that the last few days have made me feel a whole new level of hopelessness suicidal feelings and self hatred and I really didn t think it was possible to feel those things more deeply tl dr I was arrested for drink driving and now I feel more suicidal than I ever have before,Suicidal Reference
I finally found one with evening hours who takes my insurance Well until I switch to a new insurance in a couple of months But what should I say How do I assess whether someone is a good psychiatrist or not I have had issues with every therapist Ive had in the past Theyre rushing to put you on drugs after talking to you for 30 minutes They make you do stupid exercises or just sit there staring at you in creepy silence waiting for you to keep talking Plus not to sound arrogant but I find it hard to believe that another person has answers to my problems that I havent thought of already and either tried or found a reason why it wouldnt work Im also afraid that the psychiatrist will force me to be hospitalized if I tell them about how I want to kill myself on a weekly basis or that they will refuse to treat me if I get diagnosed with BPD But I dont want to be dishonest to prevent these things from happening So how do I go about this,Suicidal Reference
It doesn t matter how much you plan how much you work on it If the situation arises and you have no control over what you are doing in that moment you re just going to fall into it One of my major symptoms or I guess outcomes of BPD was these severe panic attacks that would cause me to believe my delusions and paranoia and see things These were what got me back into DBT and into therapy with my now therapist who is 2000 miles away suck it Vanessa Carlton I was doing really well Really really well I was proud of myself My doctor was My boyfriend was The first two weeks of my move were great No issues Then everything started falling apart I started doubting my long distance relationship thus feeling shameful that I couldn t make it work a lot of stupid things happened that were my fault started feeling lost and hopeless started obsessing over suicide again after 3 months of quiet And thinking about all these days in my work day the panic started to act up I could feel it build as I started to latch on to each thought Over analyzing ever aspect finding every fault ever mistake Till my heart was racing I was seeing stars and tears were brimming I convinced myself everyone was in on a ploy I convinced myself that there were secret messages in my life for me I convinced myself my boyfriend was cheating on me I wanted to go home but I couldn t I needed the money and my sick days don t kick in until after my probation So I took ten minutes and went for a walk outside Tried to calm down the best I could Did it work Not really Did it keep me from seeing my face melting off again Darn tootin I may have planned out steps when I get like this but when you can t stop what you re doing and focus you have to find a new way to deal It s not easy Sometimes you re going to fail but you do the best you can I guess I m just writing this to validate the fact that I tried And it sucked But not to be ashamed One day at a time,Suicidal Reference
So for the past three years I ve had a mix of depression really snappy mood outbursts of rage out of nowhere flipping the way I treat people thoughts of killing people suicidal thoughts and afraid of failure a lot mostly in the social sector I thought I just had a bunch of disorders and mental diseases but after stumbling onto this subreddit by accident and reading up on bad I think this may be what I have How would you advise me to move on In starting my second year at uni in September I don t have access to a private shrink too expensive but if I should go to the university counseling mental health services do you think they could help me with a diagnosis of what light be wrong with me Cause the other slightly unrelated with bpd is that I m not really sure what s exactly wrong with me like the name of the disorder s so the shrink first and last time I went told me to exercise more Did that didn t help couldn t go for another round of evaluation because exams where starting and during the summer I couldn t cause I m away from uni Edinburgh I live in Greece Thanks and sorry for the long post Any advice is more than welcome,Suicidal Reference

I ve usually got my BPD under control I think my busy life working full time going to school full time and living on my own keeps it at bay for the most part It s when I don t have much to do that BPD rears its ugly head Well tonight I experienced something I ve never experienced before and still experiencing a weird type of mania where I want to eat nothing but garbage food do illegal stuff and just let my thoughts run wild Self harm thoughts are coming to mind too but I ve never actually acted on them I ve never acted on any of the thoughts except for eating garbage and drinking alcohol Even then I ve made myself throw it up because I ve recently lost a lot of weight the right way by diet and excercise and I don t want to gain it back I am unmotivated to work out and I m starting to refuse to contact friends because as my mind so eloquently put it NOTHING can fix your kind of crazy Stop bothering your friends with your nonsense It s that kind of thinking that lures me back into my depression and the thought that I ll be crazy for the rest of my life Because here s the truth even when I m not having a manic episode or dealing with depression even when I m in my happiest moment I don t fear dying because I secretly always welcome the end to this up and down rollercoaster that is BPD If someone were to come into my apartment with a gun I might just beg them to end it all Someone please tell me how you deal with this kind of crazy I m not on any meds and I don t want to get back on them they didn t help I m normally a very ambitious person when I m busy it s just in times like these I lose myself,Suicidal Reference
Hello This is a throwaway for obvious reasons I have struggled with BPD for years now and have been aware of my disorder since I was 19 I will be turning 22 in a few days At first when I was younger I thought that a hormonal medication I was taking was the reason for my mood swings and other symptons but a visit to a therapist led to them diagnosing me with BPD they urged me to return for counseling but I was frightened by the prospect and never was able to go through with it I was a complete wreck turning my anger in on myself and my partner at the time was co dependant which made it impossible almost for me to get better as any time I had an episode they would forgive me without making me reflect on my actions or even having me apologise They lived in a different country to me only a short ferry trip but still a considerable distance for someone like me that struggles immensely with any kind of time spent apart and so I would become depressed and withdrawn and begin to binge eat To make matters worse they would encourage me to binge eat as they wanted me to be fatter and would on some occasions deliberately withhold contact from me because they knew I would become depressed and eat more On other occasions they would simply not be bothered enough to make contact with me after travelling home they would go days and on one occasion weeks without even letting me know they had arrived safely home Eventually I met two people that helped me to understand my illness While both of them encouraged me to seek professional help I was still too scared to as I had read so much about how awful people with BPD were and how most patients with the disorder were treated badly by therapists and such Instead I became more aware of my behaviour and started to self moderate myself I began to realise that my relationship with my partner at the time was an incredibly unhealthy one for both of us so I broke up with him last year planning to kill myself afterwards as I didn t want to hurt people anymore I had been manipulative and would guilt trip into attention and it was a vicious cycle of bad behaviour on both sides We loved each other but it was killing me and hurting him and I could not let it happen anymore However my friends that were helping overcome and control my illness helped pull me through I am a much better person than I was before I am surrounded by friends that love me and who I love and respect in return None of them know I have BPD except for a few close loved ones I still have some problems especially with disassociation and an unstable mood but I have started to take Citalopram to help with my depression and anxiety and I am hoping that will help with that as well Things have gotten hard lately though Whenever I go online to forums and places like reddit where BPD is a subject of discussion all I see are people saying that people with BPD are monsters that they will always be abusers and that you should just leave them in the dirt That they will and can never get better and even if there is a honeymoon period that lasts a long time they will always go back to being a horrible abuser Is that what I am Is all this progress I think I ve made all in my head I am becoming increasingly depressed with the outlook on my illness and it is making me wonder if I should just run away I have a new partner now who knew from the outset I had BPD and who has worked extensively with me to help me overcome it helping me to regulate my behavior and control my moods and helping me own up to when I am wrong and learn to apologise properly for what I have done He is loving but doesn t take any of my shit but is he wasting his time Am I inevitably going to hurt him too Would it just be better afterall for me to just disappear I feel like I am deluded for thinking I am better as all I see are people saying that s impossible that because I have BPD I can only be a monster in human skin I just want to be better For his sake and for mine And if that s not possible then I would like to know now that I am wasting my time If all I can do is hurt people then I will just isolate myself from everyone so I do not have to see the ones I love suffer anymore,Suicidal Reference
Hey Firstly the hi bit Redditor for awhile but never thought to look for a BPD sub Yay To the other bit has anyone else said a big no to therapy I d gone through the pills and counsellors when my GP diagnosed depression anxiety at around 14 through to 20 At 21 I got a referral to an ED BPD specialist centre Did the diagnostic interview got assigned DBT via signing up to research Lasted 3 sessions before I couldn t stand the therapist I recognise nearly every thought can be pathologised but I found the whole process somewhat condescending For example I mentioned that I would drive to the train station 10 minutes from home then get the train the 50 minutes into the centre because parking sucks in the CBD and my car sucks I got the typical validation style response about how driving in the city can be really nerve racking My car broke down absolutely fucked as soon as I hit the driveway on the way home and I realised that what he said was not really listening and I felt an overwhelming sense of vindication Every thought is a symptom never an accurate thought formed on presented information Disliking working in groups became a symptomatic thought and not a reasoned conclusion based on reading the social psychology research into group behaviours and personal experience Every single element of myself became pathologised and thus therapy shook the delicate foundation I had They make the disorder your entire identity which is a major no no in the treatment of basically every other mental and physical health condition I also found therapy made me want to SI more Like it pissed me off that it was considered crisis behavior since it was a daily thing even when completely calm so I felt the need to shove it in his face probably a bad behavior I stopped going to therapy I stopped the SI The real kicker if I had tried to raise any of these issues I know it would have been played off as my doing the black and white thing Was a stupid mistake to read information for treating professionals joys of working in mental health there is a lot devoted to how to deal with critisism from a patient client and almost none of it involved changing Also through a lazy GP I got a copy of the diagnostic interview report definitely confirmed my decision highlights include promiscuity despite being 21 and having had a whopping 2 partners So has anyone else said enough to therapy and found themselves happier for it,Suicidal Reference
I try so fucking hard but I seem to do everything wrong I always end up being this horrible person and I can t stop it I can t even tell what s real anymore The guy who I used to think was the love of my life won t stop telling me and all his friends that I m an abusive condescending bitch his actual words and that I always manipulate him and make him feel shit for my own amusement I have so many rules for how I speak to him I refuse to argue if I m having a mood swing because I can actually tell when I m having them I don t call him names if I have an issue I give him a potential solution to it as opposed to just calling names I don t threaten to hurt myself I don t lie I don t reduce myself to shouting fuck you if I m angry I make myself wait a few hours before sending him a message explaining my problem and I m not fucking manipulating him but apparently I m still doing everything wrong Everything I read on BPD just says to expect to be abused by BPD people to expect to cower in fear and to need your own psychologist and support group from being near us All this stuff like don t try to defend yourself it just makes them angrier and I feel like a fucking monster I just want to die all I do is hurt people,Suicidal Reference

I m so sorry for all of the posts the past week or so It s been a tough stretch and I think the end is in sight but I m scared I think that every sufferer of BPD has inside of them the potential to be that out of control hateful individual that we hear about so much That person the nons who survived borderline SOs or parents talk about Since childhood I ve recognized that part of myself as bad and done everything in my power to squash it down as far away from the surface as possible I knew I didn t want to be that angry person I just wanted to be normal I faked it until I made it and now I pass for normal quite easily I have bad days sure Yesterday though I tapped into that part of myself that I hid deep down I have terrible road rage It s something I m working on but I still have moments of mind clouding anger when someone cuts me off Well someone almost hit me which left me speeding after them terrifying my boyfriend who drives five under the speed limit at all times He finally smacked my arm which startled me into realizing what was happening I d been driving incredibly unsafely but he d hit me I ve been in almost exclusively abusive relationships before this one which is most certainly NOT So I was I don t know I was suddenly terrified He was going to leave I had been an idiot and made my non abusive boyfriend hit me We pulled into the next parking lot and he got out of the car telling me that I could do whatever he was calling a cab I was suddenly a person I haven t been in years As soon as he was out of sight I grabbed my emergency tool from the glove box and began carving a line into my leg I needed to not feel the sad so pain was better I realized that I cannot live without this man in my life I didn t know what else to do I started planning out how to kill myself using the car without hurting anyone else or leaving myself seriously injured but not dead Then I did something I swore I d never do I threatened him I sent him a text telling him I was going to do it I told him exactly how I felt I didn t tell him that because I thought it would help I told him that because I thought it would get him to come back to the car back to me It worked He came back I felt so guilty that I began to cry hard I tried to explain that I was more upset about having threatened him that I was sorry for what I d done that I deserved being hit because I was stupid He held me and apologized for his part in things After talking for a while I shared with him that I was scared I d become that person I never wanted to be What if I was the Borderline that the nons always talk about and was just really good at pretending not to be I didn t want him to become a survivor of borderline bitter and hateful He s such a kind person it would kill me to do that to him He told me I m not that person that I could never be that person I m just so scared that I really am I don t want to ruin our life together with this,Suicidal Reference
Hello So recently diagnosed but fits me like a glove Terrifying Have been dealing with recurrent and intensifying suicidality leading to several hospital admissions in the past wee while History of sexual anise eating disorder self harm on and off substance abuse Changing jobs every 3 6 months etc consistent dissociation the main cause of distress for me I think I had a bit of a eureka moment tonight and I want to sanity check it here it makes sense to me but then again so do lots of the self destructive things I do My 1 priority needs to be staying connected and engaged with life or I will continue to struggle with suicidality for the rest of my life until I succeed at it It needs to be a priority over and above my constant need to please others to the point of obsession I need to surround myself only with the people who keep me grounded and connected I need to pursue hobbies that keep me connected I am grateful my current job makes me feel SO ALIVE When making decisions I need to ask myself is this leading me towards life And if the answer is no then I need to NOT DO IT I love the people around me so much and naturally I think being focussed on my own engagement with life will improve my relationships with people around me help me to be generous with my time and love without burning myself out I don t think it will swing to me being a self centred narcissist but I think I need to and deserve to put myself first before there is no me to put anywhere Sometimes that will be hard to maintain Ie some of my current relationships are not life giving They make me disconnected and I dissociate a lot when with them It may hurt said person to step back bit then again so would my death Unfortunately this is my long term non SO It would be a big deal and I m not going to rush into ending things But if being with them makes me less connected Then it s not good right Embracing this thinking gives me hope for the first time in a long long time Please let me know what you think I need to know if this is how I should live my life,Suicidal Reference

I m not sure if I m doing the right thing posting here but I think you guys might be able to help me better with this than any other subreddit TL DR a good friend probably has BPD and I believe is in need of at least facing it and doing something about it I can t manage to help her understand it Here s the story About half a year ago I met a girl that seemed pretty amazing at first So fun to be with such a kind person I thought she was the kindest person I ve ever met I was thrilled to be friends with her eventually I was already friends with her best friend a great guy as well and they had been friends for about 2 years They seemed to be really close quite too close in my opinion at least from her side I don t think either of them wanted something more from the other person I might be wrong though I have many reasons to believe that From the start she seemed reeeally dependent on him There were some periods when she seemed like she was fine on that matter and others when she wouldn t go out if he wasn t going out either He aknlowledged that sometimes tried to not be so close but failed Lately I started getting closer to both them and learned and realised many things The girl is often getting jealous of the guy s friends and sometimes his girlfriends not always though She rages when he doesn t pay enough attention to her She is quite unstable and easily disappointed in her own past relationships She keeps doing silly things later realises they are mistakes feels really bad apologises and really means it but keeps doing the same mistakes all over again Her friend eventually got tired of her and decided to stop even talking to her She panicked showed suicidal signs so he didn t cut her off but tried to gain some distance At this point she started being quite unreasonable Whatever new person mostly girls that appeared in his life and he payed a lot of attention to she was aggressive to them It wasn t reasonable at all Through those days she threatened some times to suicide if he stopped talking to her Before I realised there s something going on I had already started to not talk so much with her I realised her intentions are good but in some way sometimes she can t control herself so I tried talking to her about visiting a psychologist quite generally She thinks she s absolutely fine and the only problem is the fact that she keeps doing the same mistakes but said she ll work on those The one person that has big influence on her has no more patience and I m not that close to her anymore Any advice on that Even if it s not BPD I m not any kind of expert of course at least it somehow looks like it and I was wondering if some of you could throw any ideas,Suicidal Reference
TL DR 25 F Recently Diagnosed with BPD currently going through a pretty hard and traumatic break up with 31 M we were together just shy of 1 year we broke up just a little over 2 weeks ago and these past couple weeks have been completely and utter hell I have been seeing a therapist for the past 7 months I decided on getting help for myself back in January because I was seeing I was getting out of control with my emotions ongoing issues with handling the feeling of rejection and abandonment We were together for almost a year broke up 3 week shy of our 1 year anniversary We never lived together I live alone No family for a good 800 miles I don Äôt have friends and all I had was him Him and I were similar in so many ways introverts don Äôt have friends he has his family but I don Äôt have mine nearby by choice He has major trust issues which stemmed from previous relationships with girlfriends and friends When we met he has just gotten out of a breakup about 3 4 months prior with an ex whom he was with for 1 Ω years they lived together he described it as Äúone week it was heaven the next was hell Äù They couldn Äôt be together for too long because they would start butting heads long story short he ended up pulling the trigger on their relationship and moved on After the break up he moved back in with his family still having some personal belongings of her because when they broke up she packed up her car and left back to her home state hundreds of miles away leaving things behind He was honest about all this and told me on our first date He told me he didn Äôt hate her but the relationship ran its course and he was no longer pursuing it anymore He let me know he still had things of hers and she was coming back to his home within a couple weeks to sort thru the rest and ship whatever was kept out I was ok with it gave him advice to just be civil with her be the bigger person and try not to make it hard when she comes When we first met there was an instant connection and undeniable chemistry we both admitted months later that we both literally fell for each other after the first date we both fell in love The first few weeks was great until the time came his ex was in town to get her stuff The day she came he was at my house I was dreading him leaving and he wasn Äôt too into it either but I wished him luck and sent him on his way to take care of business Hours seemed like days I was waiting for him to text me back letting me know how it went I finally got a text saying Äúshe Äôs gone Äù I asked how it went did she get everything and he was very short of words and seemed off I let him be for a bit thinking he was maybe he was busy or tired from a long day He later on told me that he was feeling weird not sure what he felt after seeing her few days later admitted that her coming to get her stuff made him feel like it was finally over Äúthe break up didn Äôt feel official until she actually came to get her stuff Äù I was angered felt like an idiot Didn Äôt feel official It didn Äôt feel official when you decided to pursue something with me He was very apologetic and tried to say he didn Äôt know he wasn Äôt over it and that he understood if I didn Äôt want to stay until he figured his feelings out I decided to leave him wished him luck and went about my way He tried to reach out to me and I gave in I always felt weak for him and unfortunately still loved him I decided to stay in his life but not get sucked into anything Somehow slowly we got back into an Äúunlabeled Äù relationship we were together but not He couldn Äôt let me go The next few months were hell he was still unsure of his feelings I tried to help he was very unsure of his decisions He wanted me didn Äôt want to lose me never really spoke about his feelings towards anything and when he did let his feelings out it was only when we argued He fought dirty anytime we would argue he would say things to hurt me like throw things in about his ex Äúshe Äôs special to me I still love her she Äôs not the past she Äôs the future Äù and this pushed me to stooping down to his level and hitting him where it hurt also I threw things out there about my ex untrue things because I knew it would hurt him during this time I was already becoming jealous and paranoid over his feelings for his ex he never before or during this time communicated with me or kept me updated about what was going on in his head about that or anything else never assured me of what he was feelings towards that he said he was working on sorting his feelings and I felt like I had to just sit and wait Here I am me knowing that at any second he could leave me for her This drove me crazy and when I tried to speak to him about what Äôs going on and about us it would get pushed to the side or he would try to make it look like I was dumb for Äúasking questions that were already answered Äù He had major trust issues as I stated before anytime he felt I was being distant he would call me shady and say there Äôs something else going on This went on continuously for about 6 months Breaking point was Christmas of 2014 when he finally said he figured it all out he chose me and decided to be with me It wasn Äôt CLEARLY said like that I kind of just had to read vibes and trust his actions Christmas time I had a MacBook that my ex let me borrow about 8 months before he travels for work and let me told on to one of his MacBook Äôs while I was attending school I never told my bf it was his One day he found out and all hell broke loose he grabbed the laptop and held it asked me who it really belongs to and if he didn Äôt think I was telling the truth he would break it I didn Äôt answer him I told him to give it back to me and he opened it and slammed it against his knee breaking the hinges I was shocked and upset He threw it continued to yell at me calling me every name in the book I quickly grabbed the laptop to prevent him damaging it more grabbed some stuff from my house and walked out to my car to leave for a bit to cool off As I Äôm walking out he is walking back to my front door saying he can Äôt find his wallet and saying hurtful things to me calling me all sorts of names at this point I Äôm losing my cool and I start yelling at him also saying hurtful things I let him back in the house to look for his stuff I run out to my car see that he left his backpack full of things in his car I go in his car grab it and throw it in some far away bushes He comes back and notices it Äôs gone I tell him I threw it in a lake so he would leave me alone I locked up my apartment got in my car and left I went nowhere just for a drive We ended up making up but without me going thru a period of verbal torment from him for days and him acting like he forgave me for all that and then him holding it over my head whenever we would argue again This continued and the breaks up continued We break up I would be ready to let go or ill beg for him back If I let go he contacts me to try again if I try to make up he pushes me away He would get upset over stupid things Around Valentine Äôs Day I decided I needed change we had just broken up again I wanted friends so I made a tinder account and stated on there looking for girls for friends only I found a really nice girl whom I had a lot in common with we planned to hang out but my ex got back in the picture He texted me one day randomly asking how I was doing asking questions of what I did while we were broken up if I was looking for a new person to date on a dating site or anything I said I Äôm not on a dating site looking for a new potential partner He slowly creeped back into my life and I let him I was still in love with him He started acting different and more attentive of me I was loving this new person He looked thru my phone and asked who this girl Amanda was I told him and he flipped his shit Asking me why I didn Äôt tell him I was on a dating site asking me if I did anything sexual with her I told him when we first met I was bisexual even though I had not been with a woman in over 5 years but really felt I was not bisexual anymore I told him I was on there because I needed friends he called me a liar and a whore I told him why is he arguing with me over whatever was done while we were broken up He completely went bezerk called me every name in the book put me thru hell emotionally shut down left my house and broke up with me again As always I Äôm the wrong one and he Äôs right He throws every reason he doesn Äôt want to be with me but yet still chooses to come back later on This break up and torment over and over made me lose myself mentally I was starting to believe if I kept messing up there Äôs something wrong with me so I went and got myself signed up for therapy It was helping so much we continued the cycle to argue and he break up with me and I Äôm frustrated trying to figure myself out and see why I get so angry so impulsive and say things out of temporary emotions Trying to keep up with therapy and using my tools to control my emotions I held on because I truly was in love with him and I am the type of person to never give up on someone if I feel there Äôs still hope because to me that Äôs abandoning them Also he was starting to change admitting he feels he has issues saying that he acts and does crazy things because I make him crazy and that Äôs how he knows he really loves me because of my ability to make him flip his shit He brought up seeing a therapist and I encouraged him to He even had me meet his family which was HUGE and finally made me feel like we were really official But with the period of times came bad fights continued he would get mad over things I would be desperate to save us sending long texts taking blame saying ill change him lashing back saying it Äôs done saying hurtful things about me that he felt about me our fights were always 90 over text We would argue and he would shut me out and ignore me I get desperate and my BPD kicks into full gear I start doing bad behaviors like coming to his house begging him to come outside and talk stole his license plate once because I felt since he wanted to not respond to my calls or texts EVERYTIME we argue I Äôll do something petty also every argument makes me feel like he was holding me up against the wall with his hands around my throat I Äôm struggling to talk and set myself free but he Äôs in my face yelling at me telling me why I Äôm always wrong and I believe what he Äôs saying Once he gets his anger out he sets me free then hugs and loves me We broke up last time almost 3 weeks ago He cut contact with me all of a sudden for a whole week I didn Äôt know what was going on and he never has done that before After a week of trying to contact him he finally responds telling him I need to move on and leave him alone I Äôm looking for answers on why he left me like this he breaks up with me with no reasoning or answers or closures I freak out and try to go to him to talk but he threatens to call the police file restraining orders etc every time he does that I remind him of what he Äôs done break into my house once time another time he tried to ram his car against mine he Äôs send me texts calling me names and verbally abusing me after I tell him to leave me alone etc I say this so he can remember Ä I Äôm not the only Äúcrazy Äù one that he Äôs done wrong before I know two wrong don Äôt make a right but he needs to see that also All I want is closure and reason why he is acting so different He finally tells me why he left me he said he couldn Äôt would settle for someone who is bisexual Äúbipolar Äù a liar won Äôt change and has mental issues I couldn Äôt believe he said all that especially the mental issues I was recently diagnosed over a month ago and it took everything in my power to tell him about what I had when I told him what I had he said he understood and it made sense to him of why I have done some of the things I done and why I get a certain way when feeling rejected angered etc the thing that he said that made me feel so relived and made me see he really cared was when he then said ÄúI Äôm not going to leave you when I know you need me the most right now Äù Then he leaves me 3 weeks later I don Äôt know what to do I have been a mess traumatized hurt left needing answers I have been seeing my therapist more often because I Äôm scared of what I may do to myself I have had suicidal thoughts when I break down and think of him When I force myself not to text him I lose all logic and reasoning and want to rather be dead than to feel the pain of the hurt and heartbreak He was the love of my life and my other half Thru the bad we always came back better he Äôs everything to me and still is I can Äôt help but feel he Äôs just going thru a phase right now but I found him on tinder and my mind is going crazy thinking of him finding someone else on there and being with them Ä I need help and advice I Äôm still seeing a therapist and getting help I Äôm on medication and it Äôs been helping each day is getting better because I try to block out the thoughts of him But I have my days where I Äôll think of him too much and break down have panic attacks and don Äôt know what to do The day I found him on tinder I got kind of crazy so I made a fake tinder account with his picture and a profile saying he has a girlfriend and still in love with her I changed the location to match his and any girl who comes across his page would come across this other profile either before or after viewing his actual one After a couple days I deleted it because I felt so stupid and idiotic for doing it i guess i didnt delete it correctly because He found out about the profile and texted me completely angry calling me a whore and he was going to press charges on me we argued back and forth and we got into talking about the break up and he said he Äôs fed up couldn Äôt handle me anymore that he can Äôt and will never get back together with me that he Äôs always been honest realized he couldn Äôt handle me anymore and that he tried because he loved and cared for me still does but not the same anymore that I NEED to move on and leave him alone and let him be happy find the silver lining in all this He also said that he is willing to come to my next therapy session with me and talk with me and my therapist because this has gone long enough and he wants me to get better for myself What do I take of that What do I do I spoke to my therapist and she says it Äôs perfectly fine he comes I can Äôt help but have this hope inside me that he seeing me again after almost a month will remind him of his feelings for me and maybe hes being this way because hes forcing himself to but its not what he really wants I Äôm terrified of seeing him but at the same time want to so badly I Äôm scared of what Äôs going to be said or what Äôs going to happen at the session If I hear something I Äôm not prepared for or something throws me off I Äôm afraid I Äôll fall into my dark place again but at the same time I feel I also might be able to walk away after all the feeling better and be able to move on All that keeps running thru my head is just 4 weeks ago he was telling me he loves me so much and is terrified of losing me now I have the complete opposite don Äôt know how someone could change their feelings so quickly I Äôm seeing him in a few days on Monday and I Äôm completely nervous not sure what I should say how to feel etc Ä help TL DR,Suicidal Reference

Hi I m a 31 year old female that has been diagnosed with BPD and I m really struggling right now My BF is the sweetest guy I ve ever been with but I feel like my bossy and brash personality coupled with my emotional dysregulation has ruined things in our relationship I constantly run hot cold say mean things or start fights because of my pervasive anxiety issues He s a Type B very chill and doesn t understand when I can t calm down He s also very logical and sometimes says things that I construe as invalidating when I know he doesn t mean it I feel like at this point with all the fighting he s almost thrown in the towel It scares me but sometimes I just want to give up too It doesn t help his feelings either when I constantly say I don t want to live or shouldn t be alive Another thing that s really bothering me is my relationship with his friends In the beginning we were all cool but slowly after hearing about the fights we have and noticing how I treat him when I m upset they ve grown to noticeably not like me I also have social anxiety and am very socially awkward so I say and do things that are odd sometimes I want to be able to fix things but at this point I feel like I can t that things will never go back to the way they were It really worries me because my BF even said that one of his contentions about a future with me is that he ll have to choose between his friends and me one day It just feels shitty that I can t act like a normal person and that I can t keep friends I m currently trying to get into therapy at my university but a lot of therapists are full or won t treat me It s incredibly frustrating and it adds to my feeling of being unwanted and stressed out Does anyone have any advice for my above situation Thank you for all the advice in advance,Suicidal Reference

There are days when I wake up and that is the hardest part of the day I have woken up My body did not give in to the overwhelming urge my soul has to die I am not suicidal I actually have the means around me constantly and though a transient thought may occur it is always in a What if scenario I just don t want to be alive I am not sure what that means To me I guess it is just everything stopping Stopping cold in a way sleep cannot because while asleep your brain still thinks and dreams the most delightful and horrifying things I find myself thinking well what then I try to think of the reactions of those in my life The ones who will barely notice I am gone to the ones who I do know love me But if I were dead none of this would matter I would not see their grief and in some cases absolute relief I would not see how long it takes for me to be forgotten I will not get sort of strange HA moment where I see someone realizing that perhaps I was important I don t want drama or a big wailing crowd of people wishing they had done more I want to slip away unnoticed as I have been for most of my life But I am not suicidal I am the living dead I put one foot in front of the other paste on some proximity of a smile and use my happy voice All the while just waiting to get back into my safe zone where I can be null Void I am stuck in the dialectal let me go save me,Suicidal Reference
I m usually a fairly happy go lucky person but I have to be honest Seeing a lot of responses directed at people discussing BPD in relationships has me super down Telling people to run Seriously I mean I get that some people have bad experiences but not all of us are terrible people We all deserve a chance I m not exaggerating when I say some of the shit I ve read in the past two days has made me seriously consider suicide If society sees me as a monster akin to a pedophile or rapist this analogy was used multiple times by a certain user is it worth it Yes It is But it s hard Reading articles like the one mentioned in a post the other day how to train your borderline make me physically ill I know you can t reason with the kind of people who write that trash but I still try I m a glutton for punishment that way As long as there s a chance I might make them understand how wrong they are I ll try It gets better or so they say,Suicidal Reference
The disappointing feeling when you text your SO and their response is an hour late You try to remain calm but your heart starts beating when you think Oh god he s fucking that girl from his gym Fucking Christ why couldn t he just be honest with me You call your SO and hearing their voice makes you feel better They sound calm not like they just got finished pulling up their pants But wait the paranoia sets in Their voice is a little too calm almost bored Stoic Uh baby what s wrong with your voice What s wrong Nothing is wrong Oh then why aren t you sounding how you usually sound Nothing is wrong Your SO doesn t love you anymore Everything they reaffirmed two days ago is flushed down the toilet All the forgiveness and support they showed you they completely forgot it They have slowly fallen out of love with you and are getting bored of stringing you on You get frustrated You panic You cry Pull your hair Bite your lip Contemplate hurting yourself but swiftly back down because you promised no more cutting You re screaming on the inside Your soft sniffles carry over the phone line into their ears They ask What s wrong Oh my god They don t even sound like they really want to fucking know He sounds like he s just asking me so I can stop This is the millionth time he s heard me cry He s tired of it Nothing Quickest response so that either he ll keep asking or give up He gives up He fails the test He stopped asking and has moved on so that means he simply doesn t care about your sadness You re hurt The angry grows He s a fucking asshole He doesn t give a shit about you What s the point of you even fucking talking to him I ll talk to you later You spew through tight lips He doesn t pick up on it or he has and again doesn t care Why He asks this time sounding genuinely confused Because insert bullshit reason Bye Before he says anything you hang up Wait by phone for his call Hours go by You start to get sad again Fuck maybe I was too harsh on him Maybe he s tired Bored Maybe he just doesn t feel like talking much NONSENSE Your inner anger booms I waited all day to fucking talk to him and he s treating me like shit Fuck him We ll see if I call him back An hour later you calm down Feel lonely Feel sad Nobody loves you You ll die alone you sad sick fuck But that doesn t make you any less angry at your SO Why the fuck hasn t he messaged me or called to check on my wellbeing You send him a snarky or rude text gt You 11 31pm Thanks a lot asshole Sure was great talking to you Have a good night gt SO 11 34pm gt You 11 37pm Fucking forget it Fuck you Six missed calls You ignore them with tears in your eyes You re still a sad sick fuck and now you re basically rejecting exactly what you wanted You wanted your SO to panic and call you You wanted them to show you some fucking emotion by calling you and begging you to tell them what s wrong But you ignored those calls because once you tell them what s wrong they ll dismiss it or call you crazy I don t hate you I still love you I just don t have much to say I m bored That means you don t love me anymore asshole It s all excuses to you But when you say that to them you beg your SO to believe you and that you really don t have anything to say You re a hypocrite and this constant cycle is pushing them away Pushing them towards the truth they will fall out of love with you if you can t control your emotions,Suicidal Reference
Hello I am diagnosed with bpd and know for sure that I have it I was wondering if these feelings ever go away life to me feels like one of those old black and white disney cartoons There is no color in life everything is empty and boring I spend a good amount of my time trying to figure out what my real personality is and life almost does not seem real to me Like it is some awful dream that I am never going to wake up from My suicidal thoughts never go away just depends on my mood life really just does not seem worth living with bpd,Suicidal Reference
I am a sister to a brother with BPD and I and by extension my family at large am struggling to understand how to help him cope with this He used to be suicidal etc but most of that has ended now and he seems to be in a slightly better place However things are still struggling along Although he is a highly intelligent person as of the last year he seems to be struggling most with a lack of energy and motivation to complete things like school Deadlines exams tests assignments all of these things stress him out immensely and he s put off writing a few exams that he was supposed to write last December to now and now he s refusing to write them whatsoever He refuses to go to his therapy appointments He has also not been working on his DBT he doesn t believe it works He believes he should be dead although he s not made any attempt to kill himself yet He believes he s not human He believes his problem is that he s lazy The research projects that he s been doing he feels no excitement about he doesn t work on them and as a result they are as he s put it dying He s been in undergrad for a while now and since he has not graduated for a while now and his university estimates it ll take him another couple of years to finish I think he s enormously ashamed of how old he ll be and how long it took him to finish Most importantly he feels he s not cut out for school because of his past performance and that this is the reality he must accept I won t lie I feel a little overwhelmed I m not sure how to deal with any of this My parents and I have been struggling because although in the past we have been able to calm him down and get him to do some of his coursework write an exam talk to his professor etc the effects have been largely short term The same stuff keeps cropping up over and over I have attempted to sit down with him to work on his DBT with him but I m not sure if a it s effective and b the right course of action at all Have any of you dealt with these feelings If so how What strategies did you use What kind of encouragement would work Could any of you who have dealt with these feelings explain how your families if they even did dealt with you How can we help him understand that his DBT is IMPORTANT and can be EFFECTIVE if he lets it and actually tries to faithfully use the strategies outlined I want to find the most empathetic kind but still effective approach to helping my brother His professors think he has potential I think he has potential my parents think he has potential and it s fairly harrowing to watch someone with potential squander it He knows he s squandering his own potential too but I m still not willing to give up on my brother and neither are my parents,Suicidal Reference
Hello everyone My first post here hope to gain some insights from you nice people Long story short 2 months ago I got to know a girl we met once and texted every day Turned out she had BPD but I didn t put much thoughts into it We got along unbelievably great and I decided to make a move She replied that she had a bf but has had asked for a breakup two weeks before but the bf kinda begged not to leave him revealing that his mom was sick with cancer and he needed support This girl agreed so they continue as a couple until now We re still talking since that conversation and we got emotionally attached no day went by without some form of contact no meetings though Then I started to consider my position Based on her story and her friend s confirmation to me she didn t have any hope left in their relationship and it s a possibility their breakup was impending But I didn t want to set myself for a heartbreak there s no certainty if she ll leave her bf and even if so she ll need time to heal first And I knew it s wrong to keep talking with her considering her status So last night I decided to go no contact until the situation is clear and I informed her about it saying it s the best for us etc She sounds sad but understood that it s a proper thing to do See you when I see you I said But this morning I received an unexpected message from her the gist is that this makes her feel so down because her bpd makes her can t take any kind of abandonment She s already emotionally attached to me And about her bf she said that she can t leave him all of a sudden because his mom recently passed away But with or without my presence in her life she knows that she has to leave the relationship because it s just not working out She didn t ask me to reconsider my decision and in the end of the message she even reaffirmed her acceptance of my decision but overall it s implied that she doesn t want this Now I don t know that much about bpd but I m afraid she ll fall into depression and it affects her life to the point that she hurts herself or something So I said give me some time to think it over I don t know what to do I have to think about my own heart but on the other hand her sanity is important to me too Any advice will be appreciated,Suicidal Reference
I met this young girl on a festival and spent some time with her We both seem to be quite into each other I will definitely be with her again but I am afraid of me ending up hurting her She even tried to commit suicide in january I can be supportive but not that much I have my own problems about getting involved with people that might make it even more difficult Help me,Suicidal Reference
This is hard to put into words but I Äôll try I really need some objective advice Summer 2011 a year into my relationship I happened to look at the facebook profile of my partner Äôs ex Hadn Äôt given her any thought before that he mentioned her once very early on She Äôs exotically beautiful with a huge family that s always going places doing things and spending time together My bpd wracked brain was immediately absorbed My life s been filled with eating disorders disfiguring self harm and a physically and sexually abusive family I no longer speak to She Äôs everything I Äôm not It Äôs like I shifted into a different gear once I found her Within a year I set up multiple fake profiles to appeal to different members of her family so they Äôd add me I Äôve collected what Äôs now totalling over 1200 photos of her plus related news articles and obituaries I Äôve created intricate timelines of the past few years of her life I Äôm a uni researcher great at tracking stuff down I called her once claiming to be looking for someone else just to hear her voice It makes me feel like I m a part of something nice In an absurd twist of fate she too moved across the continent and is now about 3 hours away from us I ve been contemplating planning a trip to eat at the restaurant she works at My warped theory is that if I finally see her in person I Äôll Äòsnap out of it Äô and leave this nonsense behind While I get a huge rush out of the info and photo collecting it Äôs also torturous It Äôs a ridiculous waste of time not to mention a violation of my partner Äôs boundaries I know I need to stop Äì part of that process is understanding WHY the hell I Äôm doing this Does any of this sound familiar to anyone I appreciate absolutely any thoughts you Äôd like to share Thank you for reading,Suicidal Reference
I m sitting at work and going in and out of dissociation When I snap back into it I am flooded with thoughts of blowing my brains out or escaping to the bathroom to self injure Yesterday I finally cut my parents off I just receieved a text from my little sister that she will no longer be speaking to me either I ve grown up physically emotionally verbally abused and my family is in a very strict cult sect so there is a lot of spiritual abuse as well I reached my breaking point It s been a long time coming as I am 28 and a lesbian and crave their approval no matter how damaging I don t really have a point in writing all this out and I m too overwhelmed to go into details I m just typing it out for my sanity and to keep the tears from spilling over while I m sitting here at my desk trying not to walk out and jump off the top of the parking garage where I m parked across the street There is nothing to be done Good fucking riddance to them But I am so sick upset hating myself It s not healthy dealing with all of it with them but at the same time this is so painful too I guess it s like a bandaid though it hurts to slowly pull it off and it hurts to rip it Might as well rip it off and get it over with I ve emailed my therapist but I dont see her until wednesday I have been reading over some Distress Tolerance stuff but I just can t focus I ve tried to keep busy I ve reached out to two friends but it isnt helping I am having a hard time sitting with this I havent done anything to hurt myself which im proud of except financially i just went buck wild on amazon and ordered a bunch of trauma books i dont know i just needed to type this out my lunch break is in a little over an hour and im trying to keep breathing,Suicidal Reference

trigger warning for pretty much everything so tread lightly I guess I recognize that no breakup is easy even for people with perfect mental health a bad breakup can break you down pretty bad for a while But christ this just feels like dying Before I get into my overly emotional venting let me just say that he didn t do anything like cheat on me or leave me for someone else he did nothing wrong he just tried very hard to live with me the way I am and eventually came to terms with the fact that he can t He cited reasons that all tie back into my mental illnesses Disorganized forgetful unmotivated can t get shit done alone and just too dependent and needy I ve got ADHD and BPD and anxiety What a fun cocktail of a human being I am I can t even be mad at him he s doing what he needs to for his own mental health and he s struggled with that in the past in his own ways so a part of me is really proud of him for making such a tough decision to let me go I know he still loves me and it has to hurt him to But dear god am I falling apart I am finding myself more alone and isolated than I have ever been I ve been through breakups before I ve been through abusive relationships I ve been through long distance I ve been through so many different horrible situations But not where I was so alone I had friends or a partner always at least one person who is there to make me understand that I m loved and that I need to take care of myself Even when I relapse into self harm I keep it pretty tame because I don t want to scare the people who love me Even when I relapse into eating disorders I don t go as hard as I want to because I don t want someone to notice and worry I have no one now I moved here for him Yes he still loves me but he can t be there for me right now obviously And despite selfishly wishing he could be I don t want to cause him more pain by forcing him to watch and listen while I breakdown and fall apart I have no friends aside from one who lives over an hour away and doesn t bother visiting me we always came to her She cares I know but she also has self destructive issues so words of encouragement don t ever feel honest coming from her Lately she s barely been talking at all anyway because my now ex is one of her other close friends I get it it s uncomfortable for her Whatever I started cutting again and part of me is worried that I ll start going too far Another part of me is too numb to care I can barely eat without feeling sick I ve lost almost ten pounds in the five days since he broke up with me I wasn t restricting at all before I was doing okay I hadn t cut during the entire relationship Now that s all ruined and I m honestly finding comfort in the downward spiral I m falling into I don t know how that s possible but it is I tried so hard to hold myself together at first and it was more painful than I can describe Without being able to numb my feelings at all I was so sick with that anxious kind of devastation that I couldn t even get my heart to slow down enough to fall asleep I thought I was going to have a fucking heart attack and I was so nauseous I almost threw up in bed I m still more devastated than I ve been in my entire life but at least I can numb it a little He wants me to find my happiness and my motivation in life and he thinks I can only do that without him And that he can t be with me the way that I am I was doing worlds better than ever before with him but it wasn t enough In time I will pull myself together because hope for a future chance is all that s giving me a reason to live right now But I m in so much fucking pain right now I don t feel much guilt about falling apart For now I just need to fall apart for a while I just wish I had anyone to be here for me I have no friends or family I m moving in with an old friend I d fallen out of touch with who offered me a place to stay he lives about an hour and a half away But he s not the kind of friend I can talk to or cry on or anything like that I ve tried to go to him in the past when I was going through a different struggle and I ve learned it s just not that kind of friendship I feel so utterly alone and empty and hopeless I spent a fair amount of last night wondering if I could work up the courage to kill myself if this pain doesn t die down I would do anything for human contact not internet not texting but a real live person who could comfort me while I cry or talk or whatever We re still friends I guess But every time I see his face or hear his voice I feel sick to my stomach and I feel my heart trying to crawl up my throat Every time I see something he gave me or something with any kind of tiny pointless memory tied to him my whole core goes tense the way anxiety or adrenaline clenches you and won t let go and I can t breathe for a moment Last night I dissociated while I was trying to calm myself down a few seconds of derealization happened which is something really really rare for me typically my dissociation is mild depersonalization the spacey unable to focus on whatever s going on just staring at some random spot on the floor like someone accidentally hit the shut down button on my brain It felt like I was dropping out of reality everything in my field of vision just warped and started to fade away and my heart jumped like a drop on a rollercoaster Only for a few seconds but it left me in a state of anxiety for a while But I can t bring myself to get rid of all the things that are holding all these painful memories because the thought of trying to erase him from my life to no longer hold any small part of him it feels like that really would just kill me I d have nothing left to live for It s the only way I can have hope that someday when I ve bettered myself and gotten in control of my life we could find the right time for us and give it a second try I know this is a whole lot of disjointed rambling probably but I ve just been in a shitty mindset and I need to get it out I don t know where else to go The one person who ever even slightly convinced me that he wouldn t abandon me did It s like you go through so much trying to tell yourself that your fear of abandonment is silly and baseless and then it happens Your worst fear comes true The worst thing that could happen to you does What do you even do after that How do I pick myself up and move on I can go through the motions like a fucking champ move get a new job go to school whatever Wash my hair clean my room run my errands I can put my life on track but I don t know how to fill the hole left inside of me I don t know how to find happiness After 23 years of being beaten down and wondering if happiness was going to happen for me I had finally started to find it with him And now that s ripped away and I m just defeated But the fact that I m moving out that I m leaving him that there s no possibility of him stopping me at the last minute it still feels so surreal Like I can t fully comprehend what s going on in my life right now Like I stumbled into an alternate reality and it all just feels wrong like this isn t supposed to be my fate Like I got mixed up with some parallel universe me and she was supposed to lose him and I wasn t and it feels like reality isn t quite sitting the way it s supposed to I know what s happening I m fully aware and it s breaking my heart but it can t be happening it feels so impossible I don t know how to explain it It just feels wrong A stupid part of me wants so badly to hope that he somehow stumbles across this and reads it or that I ll do a shit job hiding my cuts and he sees them before I finish moving out or anything to show him how badly I m suffering I m absolutely disgusted at this side of me because he s only doing what he needs for himself to be happy which is something he hasn t always been able to do in the past and has gotten really fucked with by some awful people and he s looking out for his own mental health which is wonderful and I m so happy that he s doing what HE needs And I already know he feels awful about it And I already know he still loves me And I love him so much I don t want to hurt him more So why the fuck am I so desperate for him to see me falling apart,Suicidal Reference
This is a long post Apologies in advance No filter stream of consciousness wrote this while crying fresh after the fight I m so lost and confused My SO is diagnosed with BPD and it s a constant battle It s a world of hypocrisy I m accused of being the scum of the earth and then she turns around and does the same behav I don t know how much longer I can last She knows exactly what buttons to press to get the worst responses out of me and I bend over backwards to keep my cool in the face of of all this but she knows my triggers to well She knows if she doesn t let me get my words out for long enough I ll reach a boiling point and explode in frustration and then suddenly all her behavior is justified because now after an hour of keeping my cool I ve blown my top just as she knew I would confirming in her mind that I am indeed the emotional abuser in the relationship that she sees me as How do I deal with someone who knows exactly how to make me into the monster she believes me to be She is so fiercely independent and stubborn that any attempt to help or support is seen as telling her what to do or forcing her to do something she treats me how a stubborn teenager treats their parents She can t seem to figure out that I m on her side I m forever the bad guy When I ask her to help me understand what I did she just tells me I don t deserve to know and she doesn t owe me anything she often tells me she just wants to be left alone but things don t get better if I do The fight is only on pause As soon as we are face to face again things pick up exactly where they left off To hear her tell it everything is my fault for this reason or that There s so much more but it s all so fresh still and somehow my mind has it all blocked up and I can t find the words to describe it I don t think I m evil Maybe I am Maybe everything she says is true and I just can t see it because I think I know what I m doing I don t know what I m doing though I m reading Stop Walking on Eggshells a book she bought me to help me understand her but the techniques don t seem to work I still get sucked into the lose lose situations damned if I do damned if I don t I m just lost Lost and confused and hurt So confused And I m typing this here because I don t know where else to go because I don t want my friends to know we re fighting because I need to get it off my chest somehow but everything s all muddled up in my brain am I even telling it right I don t know anymore I can t trust anything not even myself How did I get here How do I break the cycle They say the only winning move is not to play but how can I just ignore her hurtful behavior Don t I have a right to stand up for myself too To let her know when something she does hurts me Or do I just have to always let it slide get my teeth and bare it I feel like I dog that gets beat I don t speak her language and I don t understand why the beatings keep coming I only understand to be afraid And then she threatens to leave Swears this time it s really over it s the bests for her and she doesn t care what s good for me anyway so away she goes But I don t want her to go Despite all of it I still see the good in her the potential for happiness The girl she used to be before her depression turned her into a screen zombie I encourage her to challenge herself to make goals and work towards them even little goals but her screen is the only thing in her world after work Fleeting instant gratification from her Instagram feed pictures that disappear seconds later replaced by another and another and another forever Who needs goals when your brain can be so easily turned off And so she snaps at me I m controlling her again She s depressed She admits it but any idea I have to help is just me controlling her again It s like Inception she has to believe the idea came from her own brain or she rejects it And I m the evil one for suggesting that tonight she try reading or playing with the dog or learning a skill or having a hobby But there s me just controlling her again There s me being evil And if she does get it in her head to try something it won t last She gives up on everything She signs up for classes and quits on day two She starts a diet but quits on day two She starts a book but quits on day two Nothing holds her attention except her screen And God forbid anything try to separate them That s how it all started I finally tried to confront her about her screen addiction Not by telling her it was bad for her but about how it was affecting me How much it hurt to see the lively girl with such spirit and enthusiasm for the world reduced to this illuminated zombie How I cat concentrate on my book when she s on the couch next to me and I can see the bright white light flickering in the corner of my eye How it s replaced every other thing she s ever enjoyed and how she never has anything to share with me except what other people are doing online I had finally had enough and when I confronted her she did what she always does She cut me off while I was talking assuming she already knew what I would say she accused me of controlling her she turns it around on me so we re not discussing her behavior anymore but all the horrible things I do She has so many ways to avoid and so many ways to strike I keep my cool even though being cutoff is the one thing that positively infuriates me because I know for certain I m being ignored Then she starts saying it s over it s been over for a long time she s leaving for good and I don t deserve to know why She says horrible things about me accuses me of terrible deeds but can t or won t provide any examples She eggs me on by refusing to let me speak or refusing to listen when I do then accuses me of not listening after I ve quietly and patiently listened to everything She keeps pushing me refusing and interrupting and ignoring she gets my blood boiling she knows she s got me right where she wants me I m starting to crack I m losing my patience losing my cool My voice is raising just so I can be heard even though I know that works against me but it s the only way I can say my words is to talk over her She starts telling me to just hit her already I might as we just hit her I never do but God dammit sometimes I feel like I almost want to And then I feel sick for feeling that Sometimes I even grab her just so she ll look at me and listen to me even though I know it s just feeding her just giving her what she wants so that I become the monster Finally emotionally exhausted I slink away to cry She s dead inside I m dead inside We both want to die She packed a bag will she really leave this time Even after all of it I don t want her to I still believe in her I still love her And don t know why anymore but I do What I want is for her to be happy Can she be happy with me I don t know anymore What horrors await me tonight after work Will she be gone Will she be back I m scared of both If she is back what will happen Will the fight continue Will we reconcile and reset the clock until the next fight Will she finally be willing to try a different way I think I ve lost hope for that last one I m scared and I m lost and I m confused,Suicidal Reference

giving her what she wants so that I become the monster Finally emotionally exhausted I slink away to cry She s dead inside I m dead inside We both want to die She packed a bag will she really leave this time Even after all of it I don t want her to I still believe in her I still love her And don t know why anymore but I do What I want is for her to be happy Can she be happy with me I don t know anymore What horrors await me tonight after work Will she be gone Will she be back I m scared of both If she is back what will happen Will the fight continue Will we reconcile and reset the clock until the next fight Will she finally be willing to try a different way I think I ve lost hope for that last one I m scared and I m lost and I m confused,Suicidal Reference
Last night for the first time in a long time I wanted to hurt myself I didn t nor do I believe I actually ever would but it s the fact that I felt the desire It was in part because I was drinking and writing which can bring about some intense emotions I called my closest friend and emailed my therapist just to help me through the torrent I fell asleep shortly after and woke up to 13 missed calls and 2 extremely angry amp terrified voicemails Its the first time I ve felt like I have support It s been all going down hill for the past few weeks I recently lost my job partly because of my own issues but also because of incompetence of my boss and owner I don t feel terrible about it but I did enjoy the job and the money was good But since I ve had all this free time I ve been getting back into bad habits Recently I ve started online dating and it s gone better than I could have expected But I m afraid that the new attention will turn on me and I ll become dependent and depressed I ve also been engaging in a lot of sex with multiple partners I hate to say it but I m not using condoms 100 of the time I m not worried that I ve caught anything but it s the principle that I want to be safe than sorry I ve also gone back to eating more poorly than I usually do and working out less Then toss in cigarettes and liquor and you ve got a pretty good picture of what I consume I m transitioning SSRIs currently and I ll say that taking two at once has boosted my mood but I don t know if they are having other detrimental effects I don t want this to just a vent rant I would like some suggestions on how to center myself and to create barriers to protect myself Thank you for reading PS does anybody know how to add flair to the post Thanks,Suicidal Reference
I spent a week in a mental health unit following a suicide attempt and was released friday My parents took me to a amp e because i was feeling suicidal so they admitted me again early hours on wednesday morning I told them I was still suicidal and they said I could go home anyway my parents weren t happy at this because it s always at night while they sleep when I harm myself so they allowed me to go home in the day and come back at night Well today again after telling them I still wanted to kill myself and after they caught me self harming in my room they were still saying I could be fully discharged today or go on weekend leave until tuesday when a the doctor is available for a meeting So because I don t feel 100 safe I went for weekend leave so I can go back anytime I feel like hurting myself but I don t think staff want me there Yesterday they told my parents they ve diagnosed me with BPD they didn t say anything to me I had to find out from my parents and I don t think they believe that I am so close to killing myself I feel guilty being there like i m not bad enough and I m just taking a bed from somebody who might need it more Anyway it s friday and I ve just started weekend leave if I feel bad enough to go back early I will but to pick my clothes up I ll definitely fully discharge myself at the same time,Suicidal Reference
Does anybody else find themselves feeling paranoid anxious and spiralling as a result of it Just today for example I was in a coffee shop and there was this guy who was really rude to the server and looking really shifty when he sat down He was hardly speaking to the woman he was with and she looked unsettled He kept looking at his phone and looking around the shop In all likelihood maybe they were just in a fight or waiting for someone to join them but I could not shake the negative feeling that he was a bad guy Bad guy lead to me wondering if he was going to hurt someone What if he pulls a gun What if he has a bomb Oh my god he is going to blow the place up Am I ready to die I want to die but I don t want my husband to lose me this way What about all of the people around me Do they have families friends loved ones Do they lead good lives that benefit others How can I stop this guy It will be my fault when they all die because I haven t told anybody what I think is going to happen Despite usually spending an hour or so in there I drained my coffee and was gone within ten minutes because I could not stop spiralling I genuinely feared for my life and wondered how long it would be before I was blown up I expected to hear an explosion as I walked away and ripped myself apart for all of the people that were going to die because I was too scared to say anything How would I live with myself How could I look their loved ones in the eye knowing I just walked away to save myself Everybody hates me and everybody leaves and my husband would be sickened knowing I left everybody to die so of course he would leave me too all of this self hatred and fear when in reality nothing had even happened and nobody around me was aware I was feeling this way Is this just me Anybody else How do you cope,Suicidal Reference
I know this is all too common in BPD but until lately I ve been at least able to manage some of those bad thoughts that take over Starting a week or so ago I ve become reeally sensitive to things like more than usual It s impossible for me to stay focused in work school or even in a conversation I can t seem to stop these bad thoughts from taking over and just making me go from fine to completely crushed then back to fine in the course of about 20 minutes It s driving me insane Just a few hours ago I had a razor blade to my wrist made a final post on facebook and now I feel fine I know that I m going to end up back there very soon and I m not really sure what to do Due to some uh extraneous circumstances I cannot allow myself to be hospitalized It s going to be a serious problem for me and likely only make things worse It just can t happen But at the same time I could just end up making a really bad impulsive decision instead So I basically just made a drama fest of myself on social media for no fucking reason and I feel terrible about that I m actually not sure what I m hoping to achieve by writing this post but I guess I just need somewhere to vent my frustrations I guess I could just keep myself anesthetized until it s over whenever it s over It probably won t help but fuck it,Suicidal Reference
I waited upwards to 10months for this appointment today And I went in with a list to keep my on track in case I became emotional He was 20min late as per usual doctor etiquette and I began to read off my list which included EDIT added actual list Difficulty adapting coping with change plans etc Fear of opening up about feelings because I feel invalidated or not important enough others have worse things to deal with while I just have ever changing mood swings Blame myself for everything even other people s problems Frequent periods of dread worthlessness and despair Frequent shifts in my outlook on life I feel great vs Id rather be dead Fleeting suicidal thoughts with no plan to follow through lasts 30min 1hr Obsessive skin picking and hair pulling on my thighs Unable to get excited about upcoming positive things in life a weekend trip returning to school And he started to talk He started off with your problems are your own fault Very accusitory He went on to say that I would end up pushing everyone I knew away due to my personality and be the most miserable women in the shelter He said that it s unhealthy for me to always resort back to my mother and boyfriend because I ve manipulated them into always giving me more chances and that eventually they too will leave me He said you can t just drop people out of your life in they say something you don t want to hear But I don t I never said I did He said I need to get a job and get back into school so I would have something to be proud of myself over If I didn t have anything I liked about myself then no one would ever like me Insert comment about my weight here He kept reminding me about how one day my mother will straight up throw me out and I won t be able to return and I ll have to live in a women s shelter He said that my boyfriend of 3 years who has Asperger s can t even read social cues so there is no way he can help and me using him as support is useless and only hurts him and makes him want to leave He said that its best if I just don t tell anyone my problems and struggles because no one wants the burden of that When I go back to school I m allowed to make friends but they are strictly school friends and I m not to share anything about me or my life at all He makes it seem like the second I meet people I blurt out my life story And I don t He said that I m selfish and self centered and how I believe the world revolves around me and that I only want to hear good things about me and I want people to like me just because He said that counselling is useless to me because they will only sugar coat things and tell me how well I m doing I asked how to go about actually coping with this Work and education will make you feel good about yourself then he said read a book on BPD front to back and think about it I mentioned the death of a highschool acquaintance this summer and how I still grieve and I feed off others emotions they cry I cry He told me that I shouldn t grieve anymore because apparently I hardly knew him then he told me how he died and that I should take his death as a lesson to be learned But this particularly upset me because it was never released how he died The family didn t want the real reason of his death released and he came right out and told me Basically he said get a job go to school bottle up your problems don t get counselling I m selfish and self centered and an attention whore everyone will leave me I ll be miserable and no one likes me because I don t like me I went back to the car with my mom and bawled I told her everything he said and she didn t understand She asked what kinda doctor says those things So I need like Opinions Is he crazy Or am I EDIT I forgot to mention this is the ONLY psychiatrist I am able to see and I ve seen him since I was 13 on and off He was the one that wrote Borderline tendencies when I was hospitalized at the age of 12 for a suicide attempt and then officially diagnosed me at 15 He s been handing out the same advice since I was 13 Get a job do what your mother says stay in school I hadnt seen him in 2 years because of a university and b because our last meeting consisted of him telling me not to return until I had a job to which I left the office crying marched right down to the unemployment office and sobbed to them Then I got a job lasted 2 weeks before I broke and quit There really is no one else to see Mental health here is SO limited The only other option is a counsellor but I need to go through the hospital to do that and its a year waiting list I dont have a year to wait I need help now or I really be the most miserable women in the shelter I admit some of the things he said were correct like the job and the schooling and I need more confidence read love myself But in NO way have I ever considered my self self centered or selfish I really dont like to be the center of attention my social anxiety kinda prohibits that The only thing I can think about that would be considered selfish would be asking a friend family member to be patient with me I have a month until I see him again I really dont think a job will cure me though,Suicidal Reference

I m about to start therapy again and I really want to start things off right I stopped visiting my last therapist for two reasons One he cancelled an appointment last minute due to weather and I took it way too personally I never rescheduled and when I did eventually want to go back I couldn t figure out a way to explain my absence The second reason though is because I felt like the therapy had progressed for too long based on half truths and lies I ve realized I have the same need to impress and fear of abandonment with my doctors that I do with my friends and family I hide so many aspects of myself because that s what I m used to doing I ve never told my doctors about the extent of my substance abuse issues I hardly even admitted to smoking weed in my youth I ve never told any of them about the self harm or the eating disorders because I guess I thought they d think I was weak I never brought up my role in the rocky relationships I ve had only the effect they had on me I know that talking to them about this stuff is the whole reason I m paying them but I just can t seem to do it So how do y all do it What s the secret to getting past this hump so I can actually find help Why can t I do such a simple thing,Suicidal Reference
I ve been out of work a year and a half now I have no idea how I made it this far I have been working with therapists the entire time Last time I was experiencing panic about going back to work I found an exposure therapist and got back to work in 2 3 months I worked for about two years the job was awful and I reached a depression so bad that I didnt know if I would walk into the office or in front of a bus I just kept trying to push through each day and hold on using my dbt skills i attended a group before the job It just got worse I was missing more and more days of work because i was sick either a cold or depression some days I couldn t get out of bed I was chronically ill the building I worked in made people sick and the house I lived in seemed to also have bad air There were other things that went on that I don t want to go into Basically I had a really bad experience and now it s a lot worse than last time I can t push through on my own and I can t seem to find anyone who will coach me through it or at least find resources Can I find some funding somewhere till I get better Who would know Is there some kind of rehab so I can work part time at least till I lose my fear build some skills and can go back to full time I m not an idiot I don t want to be a janitor or some job where I feel worthless incompetent or people look down on me for being mentally ill Äù I need to use my brain I am actually pretty capable despite being out sick quite a bit I still kept pace with everyone else and did my share of work in less time Nothing came back to me about the quality of that work though there were complaints prior they were constantly on my back about careless errors and I had to do the same amount of work and check it three times before turning it in I kept trying different things to fix the problem they certainly didn t offer any help I don t seem about to do this on my own I can do a job sick and severely depressed and still keep place so fuck them I m otherwise stuck about how to get back on the bandwagon though I worked with a psychoanalytic therapist the worst most useless form of therapy I ve had years of it and was a mess for 8 months That was the only person I could afford to see me who was taking patients I m on insurance now and found another who specializes in trauma I m learning things about trauma and how it affected me but it s not going to put food on the table New therapist says process could take a long time and she knows I don t have that kind of time I don t know what the EFF to do I used to go blank at the thought of filling out job applications I literally cannot apply for a job without freezing in absolute fear It is weird and frustrating and I want it to stop so I can move forward with my life already I can t seem to get unstuck and get going This is ridiculous,Suicidal Reference
Hello to all I m hoping you can help me out I ve recently May 2015 had to move back into my childhood home that I lived in from age 1 15 Long story short I admitted myself into a psych ward in late April of this year so as to not hurt myself and on the discharge date my dad visited to tell me in person he couldn t handle me being at home anymore so needing a place to go I moved into my grandparents house to stay for the time being until I can find a way to recover Theoretically this would work out very well my grandparents lake house is a loving stress free environment But as I mentioned earlier this is my childhood house and it wasn t the happiest of childhood s my dad was so strict and temperamental that I was afraid of him and honestly thought he may kick me out of the house The stress from home and the strict Christian school I was attending resulted in me developing pretty bad OCD and severe anxiety By 2nd grade I was suicidal and was pulled from school But ever since moving here something has felt wrong My anxiety has been far worse here than it was prior to moving and during the first month of being here I couldn t sleep without a lamp being on in my bedroom which is the room I had during childhood because I had this overwhelming feeling similar to being watched The third floor where my bedroom resides has always given me bad vibes ever since me and the family moved out If ever I would visit I would feel really uncomfortable being upstairs and especially in my old bedroom So my question is this Could it be unhealthy for me to be living here Could something have happened in my childhood that I m repressing Maybe being down here is a trigger for me Or is the increased anxiety and other unpleasant symptoms merely the result of feeling heartbreak from my own father kicking me out of the house when I needed help Thanks for the help,Suicidal Reference
I hope my post does not break any rules This thread makes me so MAD Trigger Warning Hurtful Comments https np reddit com r relationships comments 3lzdhe update_2_controlling_wife 1 You cannot diagnose someone with a life changing mental illness if you are not a professional Just because you read a book and it seems like them does not mean they have it 2 The point of giving him that book was to help him realize his relationship was destructive and not helpful 3 Even if the therapist thought that she had BPD that does not mean that she does because the therapist has not even met her 4 From this post I just think she is a dick I don t think she had BPD at all Again not that I can diagnose her AT ALL 5 MENTAL ILLNESS IS ON A SPECTRUM All these people that judge BPD like take the worst case and run with it I have BPD and I m in a healthy relationship 6 There are different types of BPD Classic and Impulsive 7 Reading something and then deciding someone has it is the same as using symptom checker on Web MD and then thinking you have cancer because some or even most of it fits IT IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT 8 All these people judging everyone that has BPD ever because of one person they met that has it are just as bad as someone saying I married an Indian woman and hated her culture therefore all Indian women are bad EVERYONE on this planet is different Where we may have some similarities among us we have all led different lives cope on different levels are in different places in our lives To judge us as a whole is disgusting MOST OF ALL It upsets me how widely accepted these horrible statements are Not everyone who has depression is the same Not everyone who has anxiety is the same Not everyone who has bipolar disorder is the same Not everyone who has schizophrenia is the same Not everyone that has BPD is the same I am tired of being judged so harshly like this BPD has tried to ruin my life and I ve re built myself over and over again I have classic I m not manipulative I work so hard to be nice and to be caring I have intense emotions yes but they can also be so beautiful My husband knows how much I love him because I love him like crazy I don t cheat I don t steal I don t abuse him I don t beat him I would never do that I have been through an extreme EXTREME amount of trauma in my life and that is why I am this way THAT IS HOW BPD IS DEVELOPED But I have worked SO HARD to fight back against it To stop hating myself Beating myself up Hurting myself To stop the horrible void of emptiness that I feel that most people can t even comprehend To stop thinking about killing myself every minute of every day To stop trying to I could not stand to hurt someone else because my capacity to feel empathy is so high it would destroy me Yet this is how we are viewed It makes me so angry and so sad because I know I know what it is like to suffer and feel alone To hear these people say these blanket definitions of us no We deserve a life just like everyone else Our trauma and our illness does not define us WE DEFINE US Our actions and our words define us Our art our writings our expression these are more defining then our moments of weakness No one on this planet is perfect But we are fighting I am fighting and to be judged like this it is gross it is cruel it is ignorant EDIT I also wanted to add that I feel like BPD is now like the it mental illness to have It seems like everyone has it People are vast and so different there is a specific criteria that you must meet in order to receive this diagnosis Also LOTS of people are misdiagnosed Psychiatry is a flawed science it is never fully accurate since the brain differs from person to person and because we still don t know everything there is to know about the brain It is absolutely imperative that someone with the correct credentials diagnoses someone with BPD but even then their diagnosis may be incorrect Which is why I personally believe it is important to get multiple opinions on something as serious as BPD Be respectful towards people I know that is a lot to ask the internet for but I can t help but hope people will rise to the occasion and do better EDIT 2 Changed to NP thank you for that suggestion Thank you to everyone for your responses,Suicidal Reference

I visited with my family a few days we all got together It was a horrific scene completely filled with mania and invalidation mixed messages angry outbursts breakdowns the spawning ground of borderlines Rare terrible form even for them I rode it out mindfully day after day and set a really good example for the small impressionable ones that not all adults are bat shit insane that they can grow up and choose to be calm and compassionate in any situation My problematic pattern is usually on the way home I ll sink into full blown crisis over something trivial There is something about that environment takes its toll on me when I leave and I lose days sometimes weeks to self loathing shame whining helplessness sadness loneliness all immense and completely overwhelming I ll want it all to be over at any cost But this time I stopped it I had the skills to watch it happen from different angles I had the ability to observe deeper into my experience and the words to describe it I have experience noticing these things now I used my support lines and the skills I ve been studying to calm myself enough to get in touch with what was really going on I was able to step back far enough from my hell to choose my actions wisely and not make things worse It was unpleasant as fuck don t get me wrong I cried a lot But I got through the night without blaming anyone else for my intense situation without arguing without self destructing without making it worse This is one of my biggest hardest triggers and for the first time in my life I got through it Today has been good Tomorrow will be better It s a massive departure from normal behavior DBT taught me how to take better care of myself I struggled with trying to do DBT for years because truly it is so damn hard but DBT is making my life better in permanent significant ways like nothing else ever has,Suicidal Reference

As per title Saw it here http things my therapist says tumblr com post 126153346763 my therapist once told me you dont die from and I realized that it made a lot of sense So often when I m hurting I start to think that all these emotions are going to kill me Or I think that it hurts so bad I want to kill myself so I can stop feeling I guess it helps to realize that all our coping mechanisms are simply forms of avoiding feeling anything negative because we re afraid of drowning in them But avoiding them will do us no good and will eventually kill us The only way out is through,Suicidal Reference

Some background my SO s in college and making new friends Naturally when there isn t class they hang out have a couple of drinks watch movies play Cards Against Humanity together etc and oh my god I hate it so much I don t even have the words for it I had a conversation with him about it and I was basically a 5 year old Why are you hanging out with other people Why do you like spending time with them He tried to get me to see that I hang out with my friends and family too I replied that it wasn t the same I hung out with my friends and family because my SO can t be around all the time and because logically at the back of my mind I m aware that I can t cut my friends and family out otherwise if my SO leaves me I ll be all alone But if I had the option to be around my SO every waking moment of the day I would pick it no questions asked the rest of the world can just screw off We could just go live on another planet with no other human presence around or something I know I m a shitty friend daughter sister He then looked at me very seriously and said But the world doesn t work that way I immediately burst into tears It was honestly like a 5 year old being told that Santa doesn t exist I know it doesn t work that way but I guess I ve always hoped that it could and having it crushed in front of my face was devastating And part of me feels like even if the world could work that way he wouldn t want it anyway He said that he likes spending time with his friends because he has fun with them although he always has the most fun with me I just very irrationally can t accept it To me it just sounds like You re not enough for me which is why I have to get my fix of fun somewhere else I know it s not healthy and I know it s a coping mechanism to deal with my emotions That it s because I don t know how to regulate overwhelming emotions like jealousy and insecurity and fear in situations like these so I try desperately to prevent the situation from occurring in the first place I know but I still can t help it and it makes me feel like shit And I know if my SO went and posted all of this on r relationships everyone would be screaming RED FLAG This is how abusers isolate their victims and cut off their support systems but it honestly doesn t feel that way It s not calculated or sinister or manipulative it s an act of desperation and helplessness I apologized to my SO for thinking of him as an object as something I could possess and something I would flip out over if someone else had their hands on it He deserves to be loved as a person and I will work my ass off to get there one day I just don t know if I ever will And I don t know if I m wasting his time and if he would be better off without me and if I love him shouldn t I let him go But he replied that it didn t matter if I loved him the right way as long as it was the best I knew how and that he wanted me anyway 50 of me thinks he s deluded and I should walk away from this but the other 50 recognizes that I should respect his wishes and presume that he knows what s best for himself Taking myself out of the picture for his own good is treating him as an object with no mind of his own I m so sorry for this incredibly long rant but I guess I was just wondering if anyone experiences these feelings It would really help to make me feel like I m not the worst most selfish and abusive person ever,Suicidal Reference
A lot of the posts here are about relationships and bpd s asking advice for what to in their relationship and then talk about sex about friends etc And I m just sitting here not able to relate in any way Not to mention the drug posts or the work school posts I m not even able to fucking maintain a job much less go to school It has been 15 months since I did something regularly I went to school for 2 weeks in January and then stopped I went again about 1 week later but had to leave after half an hour because I couldn t do it I m just so fucking jealous of everyone on here It seems like you have it all figured out and I m just left sitting here by myself with nobody to talk to but my family but I don t care to talk about this stuff with them I just go on reddit all day and watch TV shows and movies and play games I don t know if maybe I m not borderline after all or if it actually can get this crippling I started cutting again recently too I did it like twice 5 years ago and now I ve done it like every other week for a few months and the most fucked up thing is that I like it If I get frustrated with something or feel really blue or get angry for some reason it makes me feel calm and I enjoy the pain even Just talking about these things makes me want to do it again I don t know I m just rambling on at this point sorry about that A lot of the time I also look on facebook and go on profiles of people I used to know I look at where they are now and then that jealousy comes up all over again Even if I didn t know them that well it ll still make me highly depressed to see how good they re doing and how beautiful they ve become I constantly think about my past friends I say past because I manage to ruin most of the relationships I get into They like me first off but then a few months later once they actually get to know me things start to turn sour because of how I act I could continue complaining about how much of a joke I am though I ll just stop now,Suicidal Reference
Hi I was diagnosed with BPD while at inpatient after a suicide attempt My therapist who I have been seeing for 3 years said that even though I have a lot of the signs she wouldn t feel comfortable with that diagnosis because i AM pretty mindful of my traits that negatively effect me As in i m self aware That being said I do have a lot of the traits of BPD fear of abandonment gt I think my friends hate me a lot Body image gt I m trans and I have a slight eating disorder I can be impuslive but sometimes i feel like its normal or not too crazy Suicidal and self harm Depression standard for the course I get angry easily but it s almost always towards myself When it is at others its when i m on my bicycle and i get mad at drivers The issue being is that I don t actually think that these are signs of BPD Like yea I self harm but is that really so bad Sometimes I puke food because I dont want to feel full or gain weight Yea it sucks thinking that my friends hate me if I read too much in to an innocent comment It doesn t seem that bad Like am i just in denial about this I m in DBT IOP and it seems so fucking pointless I dont get how its supposed to help My main therapist is a relational therapist and it s been hugely helpful over the course of 3 years Im not even sure what this is about Just really idk feeling disconnected from this diagnosis,Suicidal Reference
I m sorry I need to put across a situation and I don t know if I m being hypersensitive I m a male high functioning Borderline I come from a very religious background and most of the typical Borderline behavior constitutes a serious sin in the eyes of my church Anyway that s it s own issue but here s the problem Last week I had to go for an ultrasound I d been having really twitchy moods for a few days leading up to it and I d been feeling intensely suicidal A friend of mine from Church agreed to come with me for support I d asked him not to come the night before but he was quite forceful when he insisted he was going to come with me That should have been a warning sign After the ultrasound and I was told I was all clear of any suspicious lumps or symptoms I didn t know how to feel It turns out I d actually been hoping I d get cancer again It would have saved the rather messy idea of suicide So I decided to go to the gym I find the gym really helps with my Borderline symptoms because I throw all of my energy into that and failing a significant hypomanic episode I don t have the energy to mess up with my drinking or do anything stupid My friend instead decides we re going for a pizza Firstly I can t afford pizza Secondly I really want to go to the gym because I m feeling like I m heading towards a massive slump Instead of understanding my motives my friend accuses me of being anorexic Fair play I go to the gym for an hour a day to do cardio but I m a healthy weight and BMI Instead of letting me go he tells me he ll follow me to the gym and demand they not let me in because they re enabling someone with an eating disorder I told him that was unreasonable He told me he would then write to my gym to my elders in my congregation to my office at work and tell them all that they need to support me Basically outing me as anorexic when I m honestly not Don t get me wrong I ve had problems with food in the past I m over it now What really threw me off balance is having someone a friend get in my face and threaten me Needless to say a relatively long period of acting healthily went out the window and I spiraled for a few days I don t know if I m asking a question or just needed to talk about it I tried telling a friend of mine and she thought this guy was being supportive I can t tell if the BPD is making me demonise him,Suicidal Reference
I want to start off by saying that I am very new to BPD My sister was diagnosed about 8 months ago and my family my sister and I are still learning about it and understanding the disorder So I am very sorry if I say anything that is na Øve of the subject I am just trying to get any advice or help that I can because I have no idea how to help my sister Back in 2013 my sister was 28 years old after years of working at a boring desk decided she wanted to change her life and do something she enjoyed At this point she was diagnosed as bi polar and had several bad episodes After meeting with counselors at a community college figured out what she wanted to do as a career She spent a year and a half in undergrad classes and then got accepted into graduate school which is 12 hours away from my mom and I We were all so proud of her for taking a leap of faith and have the strength to start fresh She started graduate school in August of last year She started to become incredibly happy She loved the program loved the new part of the country she was in and she made a lot of close friends One guy in particular that was the little brother she never had Then something happened at the beginning of the spring semester when it all came crashing down We think it was a combination of mixing up her meds losing a lot of weight too fast and her Äúlittle brother Äù friend started dating a girl in her class and became super flaky She went downhill fast She started cutting and became suicidal One night she almost committed suicide my mom called her friend and they went to a hospital She stayed in the mental health ward if that is what it is called and was diagnosed with BPD She started seeing a therapist down by school But being a student her health insurance doesn Äôt cover mental health and she couldn Äôt afford seeing a therapist regularly In April she decided to take a month off of school to go to a DBT program She claimed the program helped her and she learned tools to help her cope with her disorder She went back to school and seemed fine for a while But the last month or so has been almost worse than before Again she isn Äôt in any DBT program or seeing a therapist because she doesn Äôt have the money Her classes have gotten harder and on top of that she has make up work for the month she missed She said her friends haven Äôt been helpful and is constantly in a love hate relationship with them Now she wants to quit school even though she is getting A Äôs and B Äôs She says that she realized that the career she chose is not what she wants She feels like a failure She wants to quit but can Äôt because she can Äôt make the decision and go back into the unknown world Once she said she wanted to quit my mom and I realized she has never been good at sticking through with things Nothing ever makes her happy and my question is will she ever find any job that will make her happy She did the research and chose the career thinking it was exactly what she wanted But last night was another suicidal night and she wants out How do I help her I know I need to support her but she can Äôt even make the decision to move forward She is paralyzed with fear My thought is that she needs to quit school if it doesn Äôt make her happy get a job with health insurance and go to a therapist or DBT program on a regular basis I Äôm not sure if anyone will have any suggestions or words of encouragement but I wanted to get this off of my chest in a community that will understand,Suicidal Reference
I have a long history of chasing narcissists This is because both of my parents lie somewhere in the bpd narcissist spectrum to the point of near psychosis Earlier this year I had the inevitable happen I fell madly in love with the vulnerable narcissist of my dreams who had the same obsession I actually have so he even shares my one single identity As the story goes this quickly fell apart long distance as he became unreliable and ultimately and suddenly gave me the silent treatment for no apparent reason I went nine months feeling insane suicidal disoriented as my absolute worst fear became a reality Moreover due to our occupations I have to see this individual approximately once every three months This is always a painful awkward dance where I beg him onto the floor with me and let him lead and inevitably step on my toes He always obliges he loves it This last time was no different except that I was maybe a bit more guarded I figured something out tonight that stopped the roaring storm in my head I ll present it first tactically and then discuss the philosophical and great moral merits of it I did something in my bpd craze after returning home without fully understanding the merits of it I sent him an email telling him that he too suffers from cluster b issues and that I fully understand I told him all the things I really liked about him that were separable from his mood disorder I told him that I will always care for him as a person and friend unconditionally and when if he decides to attempt a more stable life I will be there to support him When he is at his lows I am here to connect I really meant it too I plan on following through and checking in on him The rational at the time was that if I love him unconditionally platonically regardless of what he does he has no power over me I spent the next day thinking that I was crazy a consequence of silent treatment is that you question yourself heavily in these matters It wasn t until a few hours ago as I was processing this over and over and over again feeling desperate and suicidal that I felt my brain calm down I realized my life has been spent chasing narcissists and other cluster b s and that these relationships are always painful because both parties are in a constant web of lies are always splitting themselves and each other That part is kind of trivial and I m sure most of you know it The cliche I refer to in the title is that my decision to love him as a person alleviated this I m choosing to love him as his mother should have in a nearly Buddhist way I can see his cognitive dissonance the lies he tells himself to keep afloat the reason for his silent treatment his inherit instabilities and by recognizing him and loving him as an imperfect human being as a proper mother would do all the pain melts away I realize that I need to do this with everyone Most importantly I need to do this to myself I feel like all of the cluster b disorders are related to lying Just compounded lies over decades that we all tell ourselves and each other to fit an ideal and violation of these leads to splitting for narcissists its splitting of themselves and for bpders its splitting of others Its nearly counter intuitive Naturally you think the only way to heal is by receiving unconditional love I ve found that having it the way our parents never had for us works to qualm the soul Maybe it s something about the perspective seeing the flaws in others from a distance and being able to love them and I will say platonically or like family here actually informs us how others might love us I feel so energized and free I ll update to let you guys know if these feelings persist I don t know if I can really explain this I feel like I ve been told this many times in my life but I had to figure it out on my own Nonetheless it was totally cathartic,Suicidal Reference
Continuing with my emotions processing progress I m also wondering if the reason why we keep thinking people will leave us is because we re projecting our feelings on them We would leave us I know this isn t grammatically correct in any way haha and that s why we project that onto other people and assume they would too See we are most familiar with ourselves during our bad times When we re panicky insecure terrified those are the times when we re most intimately aware of our thoughts and feelings We see ourselves the most strongly and the most often during our bad moments During our good moments when we re happy when we re doing something nice for other people etc we re too busy living in the moment and enjoying it to look at ourselves during those times Plus a lot of it is casual and very reflexive For example I am very concerned about animals and I go out of my way to do things like buy cat food to feed stray cats save a frog crossing the road etc Someone like my SO might pick up on it and notice it However I don t pay much attention to it Äî or rather I don t pay much attention to myself during those moments I m busy doing whatever I m doing and I am largely unaware of myself Thus I miss out on whatever good traits I might have The only times I am acutely aware of myself are the times when I feel horrible and lash out It s like we have vision problems Äî we only see ourselves up close when we re bad and not when we re good or even neutral That is why we inherently think that we are bad people undeserving of love Think about it if you only heard bad things about this guy that your friend is dating you d dislike them too You d probably wonder why the hell your friend is still staying with that jerk when he has no redeemable qualities at all We apply that mentality to ourselves We assume that everyone else sees us the way we see ourselves and therefore we assume that they would leave us We project our self image onto them and we project our dislike for ourselves onto them That is why we are always subconsciously waiting for them to leave us Because we would ETA a poem I wrote this is the ghost of the girl you tried to drown this is the reflection in the mirror you turn away from the second skin you peel from your bones you shut the door on me so you can burn this house to the ground in peace but i refuse i linger you turn the radio off but i sing listen to me listen to me i remember the twelve years of birthday wishes you used up on a dog you never got and the year it turned into i want to be happy i spent swollen afternoons sitting next to you as you fed the cat in the backyard of your high school as it mewled and we both melted i held your hand when he branded you with bruises when you erased them when you decided to love him anyway i smiled when you took your first steps on shaky legs and again when you opened your eyes after a night of wishing to die i watched when you took your pain and swallowed it whole when you cut yourself so you would stop hurting others when you loved him so much you would give him up if it would save him i Äôve known you all my life and i love you i love you stop trying to shut me out,Suicidal Reference
Hi all I m new here As far as BDP goes I m really high up on the needy everyone hates me oh god I m going to kill myself I m so lonely scale and not so much the bursts of anger everyone s an asshole and I hate them scale I m starting to wonder if my career success has anything to do with my BDP from a young age I have been completely obsessed with physics the same way I might feel obsessed with a new person I fancy I realize that during times that I feel like I need to isolate myself I start obsessively doing physics and regrettably sometimes send really long rambling emails to other academics about it that cause quite a bit of guilt embarrassment I always thought it was just my amphetamine usage that caused me to enter these periods of obsessive study but now I m starting to think that I developed this tendency as a coping mechanism Anyone else do something similar,Suicidal Reference

Last week I ended a relationship with the most amazing girl and now I feel like I m dying and drowning and there s this void in my chest I can t fill I met this girl through Tinder I wasnt looking for anything serious but I fell face first into love It was like she was the missing puzzle piece I didn t know I had lost Everything felt perfect and for once my regular bpd issues were quiet I had an issue here or there but I hadn t been so consecutively happy in years She was having anxiety about our relationship she had spent the least four years single and she felt she rushed into something serious and exclusive I wanted to do anything I could to work through it to stick it out until the bitter end The more we talked the more we realized there wasn t a compromise we could come to She wanted to stop being exclusive and to go back to dating I wanted to be exclusive I couldn t drop the time we spent together the love I had for her and share her romanticly with other people She was the first in our relationship to bring up love and she said she still loved me but she needed to be able to date whoever she wanted I couldn t handle that so we ended it I feel like I have this hole in my chest that I can t fill I m a person who can t see a month into the future but I could see a future with her I love her so much I started cutting again it was a really bad addiction for me in the past and I relapsed I got myself into a new therapist I haven t been to one in a few years All I want to do is just end everything I don t want to feel like this anymore I don t want to know that someone loves me but doesn t want to be with me I don t know what to do or how to stop this pain How can I stop hurting,Suicidal Reference
I haven t officially been diagnosed it s a long story but I have a very good feeling that I do have BPD since I fit most of the criteria listed in the DSM V I study mental health and counselling and have access to the text I have however been diagnosed with ADHD because of the mood swings irritability impulsive behaviour etc on top of the attention deficits so I m prescribed stimulants to get my school work done They re helpful until they wear off Some of the all day medication I ve taken in the past has actually managed to make me feel suicidal out of seemingly nowhere or has otherwise given me a full on nervous breakdown I m wondering if anyone else has experience with BPD and ADHD and taking stimulants They literally make all of my suspected BPD symptoms so much worse but going without means I have the added stress of not doing well in school its a bit of a catch 22,Suicidal Reference
For as long as I can remember I have always done or said without thinking That I never stop before I do something and think about it It has gotten to the point where I have almost ruined my ruined my relationship of 7 years more then once Today was just something small I opened a 2 Leiter of soda as I picked it up Opened halfway I dropped it not having the best grip on the bottle Needless to say most of the papers on the table got drenched and a few other things I immediately picked up the bottle but the damage was done Then I start to have a panic attack as I am cleaning it up So I m crying and hyperventilating and bad thoughts a swirling in my head My boyfriend loudly tells me to stop and sit on the bed He cleans it up not saying anything Finally he says don t you think your over reacting and saying we weren t going out for lunch now Oh man I hated myself so bad I wanted to help harm so bad Eventually I pulled it together apologized for what I did and asked how to do it better so this won t happen again He told me that sure you say you didn t mean it and that it was an accident and it was but you need to stop and think before you do something This was the conversation as we walked to the bakery up the street for lunch Do this happen to you How can I fix this I bet this is something mindfullness can help with,Suicidal Reference
Today is most definitely one of those days when you manage to somehow find the energy to get out of bed even if it isn t until 10 30am despite being awake since 6am trying to get up and shower too I even shaved my legs Hah Yesterday was tough I had to socialise with a lot of people which I really didn t want to do but couldn t get out of I ended up enjoying it for the most part but it was still very straining and I m both mentally and physically exhausted because of it now A few small stupid things happened that made me paranoid people hated me and I couldn t stop thinking about whether it was me saying doing something or them I m sure you all know how that goes This led to me disappearing to the bathroom and cutting a little just to give myself something else to focus on when I went back downstairs So needless to say I wasn t feeling optimistic about how my day today was going to be I ve had maybe 2 3 hours sleep the whole night so I m anticipating a crash in mood later or even a million different crashes and rises between then hah For now though I got up and I showered I m holding on to that because with days like today it is all that I have Life sucks in every department right now with me even being unable to handle work and closing down my business making up bullshit reasons for social media because I don t want the world to know how pathetic I am It is the first time in a long time I have slipped into the depths of non functioning and I m scared For now though just for today I got out of bed and I showered I did it I did something,Suicidal Reference
alright well this is my first and probably last post in this subreddit tl dr ex SO admits to possible probable bpd post major breakup I knew her childhood was rough but i don t go around guessing what scales on what test my closest friends score highly on i typically do enjoy some time to myself to browse the interwebs play video games or maybe even hangout with other friends that I have but for 6 months we hadn t spent more than two nights apart and they weren t even consecutive she s a terribly sweet beautiful and affectionate girl before we dated I was casually seeing her for some time along with a few other women that I know knew it soon became obvious that she had feelings for me and she broke down and told me one day I knew after that day that she was the one I wanted to be with I even went so far as to tell my other partners that I planned to end our casual flings as to not just leave them in the dark about a month later I asked her out and the first month was immediately rough i was still in a casual mindset so I sometimes talk to other girls that I hadn t actually met irl but they were not platonic texting friends so yeah I admit it was a mistake I asked her for her forgiveness and made promises that I would not again talk to these partners so be it no loss to me and albeit a minor offense in my mind I knew it could be pretty devastating to anyone on the receiving end the way she discovered that message was by learning my password for my lock screen which I didn t appreciate but I couldn t argue I was wrong so fast forward another month or so and things are going steady some up and downs here and there but that s just life I left her at my house to heave for work only to receive email notifications that someone had accessed my Facebook from my tablet which I hardly used so I come home to view the history and see every single fb message from my recent contacts accessed and presumably read months back well it didn t take me long to guess who but I didn t immediately confront her because I understood it s just because she worried but I was distraught and later that night we decided to drink and I still was feeling raw from her lack of trust so I wasnt happy and she eventually confronted me about it and so I told her I knew she didn t deny it but the argument got heated and eventually she left I was unharmed but she can be violent at times and I was surprised I didn t catch a television remote to the face I broke up with her then next couple of days we talked and I was waiting for her to get off work the second day so we could talk so I asked her if I could come drive her home from work which I had always done but it turns out she had made plans to go the bar with all of her coworkers and I ll admit that made me feel angry and jealous just so happens we were having a show at our house and there were a couple of women attending that had basically begged me to have a three some with them a few weeks previously and so I invited them into my room for drinks honestly I felt slighted and assumed she was out to get hers so I might as well get mine and I did the thing any man would do we eventually reconciled and got back together but I mean what do I say at that point life is hard enough as it is without her constant mistrust and arguments I spared a lot of the smaller stories and day to day slights of hers well the last two months were absolutely the worst we d fight she d accuse me of a myriad of offenses we d basically brawl over the fact that I was looking at Facebook and she would give me the what for for it I d try to leave when we were arguing and she would stand in front of the door and refuse me to leave for 40 minutes she d yell and tell me to get out and then when I attempted to leave she would repeat the door block method forcing me to stay I d give her rides places and we d fight then I d drive her back to her house and she wouldn t get out for around an hour just sitting there in front of her house in silence mind you when I want to get myself out of a situation I m already livid and then she locks me in and won t let me cool down she drove me through the roof so I finally called it quits for good then she tells me she wasn t diagnosed but that they thought she had Bpd she had been in and out of kids homes for two years had attempted to end it all etc etc my point is I loved her I still do but I just couldn t argue and fight anymore I feel though if she would have told me she had a reason for the extremely obsessive behavior that I could have would have able to understand I m not stranger to mental illness I suffered two years alone in a major depression I m a truly understanding individual but I just didn t know I didn t know why I was being put through the constant struggle and I just know I would ve handled it different had she just been upfront about it we broke off all social media and stuff but we hung out the other day and it just reminds me that it s what I want having multiple partners and no rules is generally every young guys dream but I m looking towards the future and who I m gonna end up with I want it to be her and that s why I chose to date her in the first place she doesn t answer my texts and I know her heart is broken she begged me to date her again for the first week 130 texts of just begging me to come back with no response from me I was finished but i understand now she had a pretty ugly past with hard drugs and stuff before we dated I was there though and I saw how low she can go even if it doesn t work out I want to see her be successful and happy in life and I just worry because she s not seeking treatment and she is withdrawing from me and most everyone else wat do bpd,Suicidal Reference
I m very lonely Thinking about it I believe this is because I think that the people around me experience the world very different than I do I don t really have a lot of days where I don t cry or at least have to choke back tears That is fine I can deal with that but I need someone to understand Really understand how it feels I feel so selfish I just think that maybe if I killed myself they would know The sadness the despair I don t want to hurt them but it would be so nice to feel understood just once Even if I d be unable to experience it myself We could be really sad together I could write a letter to explain I m not gonna get my life together anyway It s too late for that I mean it doesn t matter anyway People die every day I think if I dragged it out I d only disappoint them even more I could save them that and fulfill my wish That s good right The more time I spent trying to get better the worse I get and the more I realize that people think I m worthless I always suspected it but having it confirmed is both painful and relieving at the same time I think maybe I should just cut my losses Thank you for your time Edit because I love escalating and I m a drama queen let s move this over to r SW http www reddit com r SuicideWatch comments 37iqg8 i_feel_like_playing_tonight yay POS me,Suicidal Reference
This is actually my first post on reddit so bear with me Sorry if this is all over the place Heres some basic background information 18 f I was diagnosed with BPD a few months ago when I had an appointment with my therapist after attempting suicide The psychiatrist at the behavioral health clinic I stayed at diagnosed me with bipolar disorder which I automatically knew was wrong Everything about me screams BPD and I felt somewhat better after being finally diagnosed I took medication antidepressants anxiety antipsychotics until it made me psychotic i was prescribed it for my bipolar disorder until I ran out and have had insurance issues ever since so I don t take anything I just don t know if lying so much is normal I have cheated on my boyfriend of 2 years 3 times I know what you re thinking but these are friendly kisses thats what i m trying to tell myself He knows about all of this and gives me endless love and is very forgiving He reads all about BPD and understands it more than I do I love that about him but I am so scared that he is going to soon get tired of getting hurt so often My chronic flirting and interest in almost everyone I lay my eyes on is eating me alive I love him so much but I love more attention even more In my head I hate myself so much for it and can t stop No I love myself for it Then hate myself Back and forth I lie about everything I possibly can not only pertaining to my relationship I lie to my parents friends everyone It starts to get to me and I beat myself up over it then get over it The cycle always repeats itself I m surprised I have yet to cut myself since my suicide attempt I don t want to hurt everyone in my life yet its the only thing that excites me How can I stop myself from slowly killing myself again,Suicidal Reference
I m a new poster here but I have been looking around now and then and reading other posts I was just wondering if anyone here was diagnosed with BPD or EUPD as it is sometimes called here in the UK under the age of 18 I m currently 27 and have known about my diagnosis about 5 years though I have never agreed with it and have never had anyone explain the why s and where s that I fit into it I feel I was only given it because of my long history of self injury now over 19 years After some issues with my mental health team back in October November long story I made an official complaint I received a response to my complaint a few days ago and a previous psych who was interviewed as part of the investigation said that the diagnosis was actually given whilst I was under the child and adolescent mental health service CAMHS at 15 and he agreed with it when I was assessed by his team at 21 Neither me or my Mum were made aware of the diagnosis and I had no contact with mental health services from 16 until I was 21 So I was just wondering if it is usual for someone to be diagnosed with this so young And if they thought I had it why would I then have no contact from any mental health professional until I asked for a referral at 21 Also how can someone stick with a diagnosis made 6 years previously and not tell me about it I m not sure what I am looking for here but I am a bit confused and was wondering if anyone might have some advice or comments to make Thanks,Suicidal Reference

Hi this is my first post Reddit I was cheated on by my boyfriend left for another girl Twice with the same girl I am deeply hurt by this and it has been 9 months and I am having a lot of trouble not talking to him and staying away from him We still have sex sometimes even though he dating the other girl still I went to therapy a couple of years ago and was diagnosed with BPD but quit going for financial reasons I can afford it now though and I have an appointment Friday I am having a very hard time forgetting about this I feel like he s the best boyfriend I ll ever be able to have and he s perfect for me and the other girl is manipulating him and he s just too innocent to realize it It s got me in pieces tonight and I am crying and have already self harmed,Suicidal Reference
There is a guy I ve known since 5th grade now in high school I always an interesting relationship with him with a lot of drama and constant switching between being best friends and worst enemies There was something about him that made me feel very strongly I was always aware of his presence in the classroom and I would think about him a lot and how he behaved and what was going on between us at that moment He was the only person I knew with whom I felt like that and I feel like he had some kind of control over me I avoid him now because of some stuff that happened and I can t handle being around him Also I have another guy in my class whom I opened up to about a lot of my past issues For some reason I felt like he d understand things such as self harm and that stuff I couldn t handle talking to him in the long run though so I started to avoid him too I recently realised that these two guys have something in common that I never felt in anybody else They both have some sort of intensity and realness about them They both seem to have some sort of mental illness but I am only assuming here though the first guy almost certainly does They have some sort of heaviness about them When they speak to me I feel like I am 100 in their attention and like I am in some sort of bubble and completely vulnerable and exposed It feels like when I talk to them they have 100 control over me They affect me and make me feel in ways that nobody else does I am terrified of both of them and simply can t deal with the emotions I get because of them I feel lightheaded and like I need to cut after talking to them It s a shame because the second guy is pretty nice but I feel like I need to avoid both of them to remain stable Neither of them seems to be aware of the fact that they make me feel like this I spoke to a few other classmates about this and it turns out others have noticed this heaviness about them too I can t quite put my finger on what it is about them and I was wondering if anybody else knows similar people or what causes me to react so strongly to them And if there is a way to handle them without having to avoid them,Suicidal Reference
I feel that i am only still living because i don t want to hurt friends and family i know it would destroy my parents They can t help me though there is nothing they can do it has been 16 years of trying It doesn t feel right to live purely so i don t hurt other people when i am in almost constant pain I don t know what to do i don t want to be here but i don t want to hurt people I see it like euthanasia if another organ was causing this much pain then surely that would be thought about whether action would be possible or not due to legality issues edit not that it makes too much difference i guess but that made it sound like i am 16 i am 26 i have hated life since i was about 10 edit thankyou all so much for you comments btw and apologies if i am being a bit ranty in response,Suicidal Reference
I want to keep this short because I have a killer headache and I m a disaster right now I just want to go to sleep and not wake up I m not cut out for life I can t be well rounded I can give everything my 110 but I can t do like 60 one thing 40 another So inevitably when one thing comes crashing down I m left with nothing My SO and I had plans to see each other today but when I asked him what the plan was today he said he had a spontaneous family trip to celebrate his dad s birthday and he couldn t see me today So I said that s cool we can hang out when he gets back which he said would be around 6 7 5 minutes later he calls me and says he wants to break up I can t remember what he was saying I was hyperventilating and losing my mind but the gist was that I was smothering him and not giving him any time to himself that he couldn t just use all of his time and resources to see me all day every day I was fucking blindsided I thought things were going amazingly He never once hinted that he was having any problems I even asked him yesterday Hey we re okay right Like let me know if I need to take a step back and I will And he just said Yeah we re great Are you okay So yeah this caught me by surprise out of nowhere He said he lied about the family trip thing he just was too immature to talk to me about this and he was putting it off and didn t want to do it in person He was in the middle of explaining and I hung up I couldn t listen I called back after hyperventilating for a few minutes and then I talked Asked him what went wrong what I did why this is so sudden why didn t he tell me sooner I could have changed things I thought we were great He agreed and he said he regret breaking up as soon as he said it He said that if I would let him he would love for me to forgive him for this and try again We need to just take our relationship slow We re going to see each other about twice a week rather than 5 6 days out of the week And I m going to stop demanding his time and just take no for an answer But I don t know how to cope with boundaries I m a nervous wreck I don t know if this is the same relationship and we just don t see each other as often I don t know if I have to be careful about what I say I don t know if I can talk to him like we did before I say something but then I apologize for saying it because I didn t know if it was appropriate I m short circuiting and I m not comfortable like I was anymore My whole world just turned upside down and I didn t expect this at all Now I have to learn to have a life with him as a part of it rather than a life revolving around him But I can t divide my attention like that It s too much to handle I also told him that I would move to Florida because I didn t want to put that pressure of moving in together on our relationship and that we should enjoy what we have while we have it I just want to curl up and never face the world because I can t deal with anything Honestly guys I m not feeling great I want to self harm I want to not be here anymore I can t see it ever getting better because when I do it s all a lie anyway You were right about my last post I m sorry for being stubborn and not believing you,Suicidal Reference
I don t know why For some reason it feels like abandonment My dad recently set a boundary with me and that was that I was not allowed to call him on the phone when I am freaking out and cry He goes up to the camps up north from Wednesday to Wednesday and so he s not around I guess My dad is not really emotionally supportive he says that my emotions aren t reality that they re overreactions and manipulative He believed that me crying on the phone because I m just so hopeless and don t know what to do is me trying to emotionally manipulate him I know that s stigma but I was less upset about the stigma and more upset by the fact that I m not allowed to cry while we re on the phone together anymore Intellectually I know that it s because me crying distresses him Emotionally it feels like he was saying that he didn t want to be there for me Maybe it is manipulative but I feel like if he doesn t hear that I m hurting then my hurt won t exist I m incapable of being miserable by myself In the past when people ignored me while I was hurting I cut just to make physical proof that my emotions are real because when they re in my head they aren t I know that in order for us to have good healthy relationships with the people around us these people need to set boundaries But it s distressing and it feels awful and just ugh I could literally burst out crying right now just thinking about it Typing this up has left a boulder in my chest,Suicidal Reference

um hi posting under this account okay so I have my group of friends I love them dearly but when a new person showed up everyone started to flock to this new person I felt left and abandoned I still have this pang of loneliness that cripples me to a stop it feels like I have been replaced and they don t love me anymore well after a couple of stupid things I became hateful and spiteful to the other person that stole my friends away my mood emotions have been cycling into everything under the sun between sad to mad to murderous rage to suicidal depression I have threatened the fuck out of this person s life and even spent 3000 on multiple anger times in order to go and kill this person because of the abandonment feel I have also started down a path of suicide hell I have attempted to kill myself via overdose on antidepressants antidepressants and alcohol cutting rolling over my car multiple times while cutting lithium poisoning and anticonvulsant med overdose in the last month and a half 16 times total my mood falls so recklessly and my emotions take over so quick that I end up doing that a lot I kinda am in a suicidal place right now and no matter what I trap myself in this hell I either get murderously angry at friend stealers regret my actions and commit suicide or remember what I have done and commit suicide Most of the time it is kind of spur of the moment take all of your meds at once type thing my question is has anyone else reached that level of instability with emotions and how does one control it I think it is best to say that I am scared but also ultimately scared of everything else sorry to bother llqsa,Suicidal Reference

So I m 17 and I ll just give you a brief summary of the events leading up to my current mental status In 7th grade I first realized that I wasn t like most of my friends I didn t really talk about my feelings to them or anything and it took a toll on my I started cutting and it seemed to help temporarily I was in a deep depression through summer and into 8th grade In the middle of 8th grade I became friends with my current best friend She and I were a lot alike We told each other everything and I finally felt like I was no longer alone For a few months we didn t talk because we had gotten into a fight During that time I used social media to seek out replacement friends I used to tell this guy named Tommy from a neighboring town about everything in my life Looking back on it I think I just did it for attention I just wanted somebody to be there for me because my Nparents never were Freshman year I thought things would get better but they didn t I attempted suicide twice and was in a dark place Summer went by and I started 10th grade I finally started to push the negative thoughts aside and was finally happy In January my old best friend and I reconnected and I felt like we had never stopped being friends because we still had our strong bond We would go to parties smoke pot drink your typical teenage experimentation Well in February a different friend of mine told my parents I was suicidal They made me go to a psychologist and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety My friend who I had reconnected with was sent to FL in April to live with her grandma I impulsively tried to drive from WI to FL to get her I ended up getting tricked into turning myself in at a small town police station in Illinois I was diagnosed with adhd and an impulse control disorder at that time I am just finishing my junior year and have taken a step back and looked at my life as a whole I am very happy with the progress that I have made but I also noticed that I have severe mood swings and tend to push others away from me by making scenarios up in my head There is so much more that I could tell you but I don t want this to turn into a novel In your opinion do you think there could still be an untreated mental illness within me,Suicidal Reference
This is so hard to type I m a 25 year old female from England I have been experiencing problems with depression for several years though now I think it might be BPD I have struggled with feelings of emptiness and loneliness and suicidal thoughts for years I experience relief and a sense of I don t have depression anymore when I am doing something fun with friends or feeling like I have friends Like when I first started University at 18 I was on meds but because I was socialising with new people and away from my controlling parents I finally felt free I finally felt I had beaten it Then I get angry if other friends are hanging out with other friends without me or when some people didn t show up to my 19th birthday party I practically threw a tantrum and screamed at everyone and cried I think I need to be the center of attention I have yelled at my parents in pure frustration since I was 15 or so When I enter a new relationship I feel alive again I get addicted to that feeling of being loved but when the honeymoon period is over I feel depressed I cling to that rush and feel like things are going badly if they are calm I don t feel like I have a personality anymore I have adopted bits and bobs from each relationship thinking they are the one so I put everything into it I have had 4 serious relationships without much of a break in between With my third boyfriend his brother passed away and he stopped loving me so I got extremely depressed and over thought everything he said until I broke up with him Then I obsessed over him for a bit My last relationship ended two months ago and it was the most intense yet I met a guy from America 7 years ago For 6 of those years we were very good friends supporting each other through the highs and lows of life He confessed feelings of love to me a few times but because I was in a relationship living in England at the time nothing happened Then in March 2014 I went to visit him and we got into a relationship I finally felt like myself and finally felt I had beaten the depression That was just for two weeks though Then I started worrying and fell into clinical depression again Felt suicidal I went to live with him for 6 months from October 2014 Just before that I had cyber sex with a work colleague I was in a state of complete dissociation when that happened I felt like I was living out of my body I hate myself for it My boyfriend forgave me for it I was very jealous of his ex s Looked through his phone for evidence Over thought everything Very unhealthy relationship I could feel him pulling away He smoked a lot of weed I smoked a lot of weed and my depression got worse Slept until 1 pm every day found no motivation to do anything He was there for me running out to get food for me but wasn t there for me emotionally Argued a lot He has an anger issue He told me he had to walk on eggshells When high I had a panic attack thinking I was a lesbian I d never really found happiness in my relationships with men so I assumed I am destined to be with women We broke up he was very forgiving and kind to me about it Now I feel I made a fucking dumb mistake I went with my feelings and didn t apply logic or reason with him I moved back in April I live with my parents and have no job and feel like I m dying of loneliness My friends only want to meet up with me once or twice a month It s all my fault I lost my ex I d do anything to convince him I am worth trying again for The guilt and pain of losing him kills me I spend all day going over what happened in my relationship torturing myself Every minute of the day hurts My actions were selfish and stupid If it weren t for my actions I d be planning my life with him I feel I fall into the same repetitive pattern of self sabotage Sometimes I want to kill myself to end the pain Sometimes I m okay It s been especially bad this week My ex and I are still friends because he is a good person and wants me to be okay He ll text me but it s killing me I want to change but I know a part of it is for him I want to convince him things can be better and I ll seek professional help for him I m finally sick and tired of being depressed in relationships and in myself and he s the one who convinced me that things have to change What annoys me is that I don t think the above is the real me I think in general I m quite a calm positive intelligent person but mental illnesses ruined everything and I was stupid enough to give into it,Suicidal Reference
Does anyone else experience an involuntary chanting where you get stuck in a loop of repeating words I seem to do this both in my head when I m by myself and out loud sometimes when other people are around What is it called Chanting seems to imply meditation or protestors nothing like the obsessive distressing experience I m referring to When I was depressed and feeling urges to self harm phrases like I m fucked up I m stupid I m fucked up I m stupid I m bad I m fucked up over and over again on a loop and the longer this would go on to more intense and quick the words came For example it would often start with Why is everything wrong What did I do How did I fuck it up I must have fucked something up I must have done something wrong I fucked up I m stupid I m fucked up I m bad I also do this out loud Sometimes I have gotten stuck saying the I m bad spiral of phrases out loud but other times my verbal reaction is more directed at others if they are present and I seem to feel hurt by them An example was the other day when I was upset that my partner would not agree to my request I didn t come to bed because I was trying to process amp validate my feelings of sadness while still respecting his decision I was unsuccessful at processing them ended up crying for hours He came out to calmly ask me to come to bed a few times but I was upset that he hadn t just gone to bed himself Finally after a while of conversing with him without being able to logic very emotional I ended up repeating You re stupid you re wrong you re stupid you re stupid you re wrong to him like a chant When I chant like that internally or externally I stop being able to think I start doing it automatically I can t stop myself To stop the cycling I either end up running out of the room falling over hurting myself or wearing myself I have anxiety also as well as ADHD amp BPD and often this chanting sparks my anxiety When I notice the dissociative feelings where things get super blurry and my mind stops thinking except those thoughts I start to panic The panic often ends up curbing the cycle since I ll start to hyperventilate yell or even shriek scream Has anyone else had similar experiences What do you do to get out of the loop before full on flipping out Do you consider this to be dissociating I think it is because I certainly don t feel like I am controlling my mind and or mouth anymore I definitely start zoning out I think for me it might be a little different since when it combines with my anxiety it seems to turn into a panic attack very quickly Since it turns into acute panic I don t get amnesia or anything and I get this weird combination of being zoned out while simultaneously feeling extremely heightened emotions and tense all over I have just straight up felt floaty and dissociative out of stress before but it s relatively rare compared to the panicky incidents,Suicidal Reference
My therapist told me I probably have borderline personality but I m getting a formal diagnosis later today It s been such a struggle to get to this point She told me last December that this was likely my issue but I ignored her because I felt like if this was what was wrong with me it meant I was a horrible person even though I know having BPD doesn t mean that Because I ignored it and kept trying to fix things on my own I fucked up my life royally I lost my two very best friends because of my suicidalness and inability to be alone with my emotions and the shit testing seeing if they still wanted me by pushing them away I just blew it all up I ruined the most important thing in my life trying to act like I could get better on my own My therapist pushed me in April about the borderline diagnosis since anti depressants have never worked for me and here I am now It s been nearly 3 months since I lost my friends and I just don t know what to do I have other friends and another best friend who has been at my side despite all this but it hurts so much It hurts knowing that I lost the most important people in my life because of a disease I know I m a good person and a great friend I know they miss me too and have said that they care about me but that it s better off this way they say It s so hard If only I wasn t so messed up that s what I feel like I don t want to lose their love I have such few friends to begin with because I m so terrified of opening up It takes me years to loosen up around people I ve never felt so hurt in my life even when my own family tossed me out of the house it s nothing compared to losing people who actually love you,Suicidal Reference
I m diagnosed BPD for one reason and another have been waiting for therapy for 2 years or more I know myself I know how BPD works and what it is and how it affects me and I m in a situation where a friend someone I ve come to rely on in a way I would never normally consider is in the process of dropping me not my imagination I have been as mindful as I possibly can be about what s been happening between us over the last couple of weeks and it is breaking down and it s horrible and I am not imagining it I never get involved with people like this because this is exactly what happens and now I am so scared of what I might do when things come to a head The type of self harm I do in a crisis situation has got so much worse I cut down to the fat last time I have also been trying as hard as I can without therapy or whatever to understand why I m how I am and I really feel like I might be getting somewhere but it s been with a lot of this friend s help and now it s going and I m on my own under his roof currently I left my husband about a year ago and still have literally nowhere else to go What can I do to help myself now what should I be doing should I be calling whatever psychiatrist I m under at the moment or service or whatever to say this is happening and I m ok I m just worried for me I do not want to self harm again or go crazy like I know I do our conversations are kind of I can t explain like threatening my sense of stability or something every time and I don t like how it feels how do I keep myself together while I navigate this without destroying our friendship or making myself homeless I m panicking because this is the result of a stupid decision I made to put so much trust in someone else and I ve got no one else to blame but myself I ve got that mineshaft opening beneath me feeling and I have no idea where my therapy referral is up to or what services I m still entitled to use or whatever so if anyone has any advice for me I would be really grateful,Suicidal Reference
Wall of text sorry So my partner of 10 Mos and I are both diagnosed BPD Been living together for about 5 mos now just got a puppy together last month Everything had been fine we were both in treatment and seeing weekly councillors though the usual ups and down of BPD were still there we handled it amazingly and it gave me hope for a real healthy lasting relationship Id struggled in the past with going boarder lion and kicking her out of my apartment Since the puppy I ve stuck to my rule to not do that it s not the real me and I remember how it feels to be on that side So last night All day I was in a bad mood looking for jobs and filling out applications online I asked her to take the dog for a walk somewhere for a few hours as I needed some space I asked her this almost an hour before she finally left as Id asked so if course here I am fuming that she s puttering around and doesn t respect my space She leaves I have some me time and am just starting to feel somewhat like myself and she storms back in with the dog Words are exchanged I told her Id txt when I was ready and she completely disregarded that She again takes her time puttering around before going out again Now I m all roar y Starting from square one trying to get my shit together and knew I was failing Sent her a txt please don t come home tonight She has both parents nearby and friends I was not leaving her without a place to go but knew I wouldn t be ok all night The sane non BPD part of her knows that I wasn t trying to kick her out But apparently she d gone over the edge too She called her father and came and picked up all her things just like before when it was my fault and i was kicking her out I repeatedly and pretty calmly kept reminding her as she packed that I didn t want this and she was choosing to go I also said that I can t do it again if she takes her things and leaves they aren t coming back She left saying you don t want me you don t love me with tears in her cheeks I called out that I love her and I hope she feels better She texts me in the evening blaming me for not caring not trying not loving me nasty mean things Id never heard her say Sure we ve fought but she called me out on a failed past relationship she was aiming to hurt and it did She told me she was going to kill herself She had 96 morphine pills and a bottle of vodka I told her I understood the feeling but hoped she wouldn t do it Then I passed out for three hours Cuz of all the lorazepam I took When I woke I called her as Id heard nothing and the last message wasn t good Her mother answered apparently shed left her phone at home and taken off somewhere Her mother reemed me out blamed me told me I m fucked in the head her mother that had met me once Anyhow desperate for info I bite my tongue and we txt she s taken off hours ago her mother isn t out looking but made a phone call to the police they won t take a report for 24 48 hours I tell her where I think she d run off to and try to be civil through the blame of a panicked parent I ask her to keep me updated and if by the morning no info I am coming to find her I spend all night in the worst anxiety and panic I call every hospital cop shop and clinic I can think of Nobody will give info over the phone though my gut tells me she s in that hospital thy transferred me to the charge nurse HShe told me I hope you enjoy the guilt in one of her last texts I can t stop thinking about that She chose to leave I told her I love her I went through all of this in my last relationship But I was on her side of it At exactly 9 am her mother texts me that they are home from the hospital apparently she was found by the lake as i said by someone comin back from fireworks I didn t get much detail but she must ve been in a bad state the police were called Apparently her mother father and lawyer all went in to get her off of the Form 1 and allow her to go home with her mother My mother received this text from her at 9 am as well Yes I am now Took too many and drank too much Was found by someone after fireworks and police were called My stuff is out of there and its not going back neither am I I had an epiphany last night and that was that no one especially her is worth killing myself for I just Don t know what to do I don t think for a moment that s her texting it sounds much more like her mother And seeing as she d just ODd she wouldn t really be able to text I m waiting for her to wake up at her moms I don t know what ll happen I don t know if she ll even contact me I don t know if she will want to come back and I don t know if I should let her I don t know how any of this happened Her family clearly hates me and though this relationship has been my healthiest and I love her more than I ve ever loved anyone and I finally SAW a future with her not just a fantasy She helped me when I was losing it but I didn t do these things she stood by my side I m so torn I want to stand by hers but sometimes I need to be okay before I can help you be okay,Suicidal Reference
I ll try to make this as short as possible I might fail miserably I ve been diagnosed BPD very recently I am a man in his thirties and I believe I am what they call a quiet BPD The way I understand the nuance is that the only people I could stab or punch out of intense anger is myself and I do That said on a slightly less crazy note when I look back at my love life I realized I just cannot date girls Of course I have to consider that I had three girlfriends and surprisingly managed to stay with the second one for 8 years Nonetheless when it comes to dating girls I just can t Even when they come to me not that it happened 50 times I have a negative attitude toward the situation Either I stay immobile and try to simply ignore their advances or I just behave slightly impolite just to jump over the possibility or rejection I guess I suppose I fear being not interesting or just awkward I really hate the performance I have to display in order to impress the person in front of me especially when it comes to love relationship The fucking performance Being that guy that is the center of attention Super social respected and all How am I supposed to act like this if I hate myself so much I have zero confidence in myself regarding pretty much every spheres of my life Anyways most of the time I ll stay in my room I hate going out in bars and clubs I hate club so much it hurts Now I ve come to the conclusion that I should just not care about love and focus on a hobby and or a career in arts While this is not a bad plan on paper I need affection it has been so long since someone touched me I am suffering from this Aditionally if I ever end up in a relationship I will never initiate sex and will have a hard time making decision Not out of lack of dominance but by a lack of interest I just cannot connect The ex I lived with 8 years had a connection with me but she cheated on me and left me for someone else Thinking about this generally triggers suicidal thoughts I feel powerless as I write this Anyways A bit of venting just to ask this simple question I would like to know if some men with BPD here on this forum have similar issues How do you approach dating How do you approach being in a couple Do you have long lasting relationships Please feel free to create your own questions if you want EDIT I failed miserably sorry,Suicidal Reference
Hey I m gonna start this by saying this is my very first time on Reddit so apologies if I get something wrong amp nbsp So trying to keep this as short as possible last week my bf and I fell out over a small misunderstanding over text The situation escalated when I tried to explain what I d actually meant he wouldn t listen and got angry Felt like I was trying to prove my innocence and not listening to him After a while of this I got fed up and told him he is overreacting one thing led to another and he threatened to hit me This took me by surprise and I told him I needed space In that time I spoke to various friends advice boards and counselling support services and they all pointed me in a similar direction take some time for myself and ask him to get help for his anger this isn t the first time he has lost his temper insulted me or blamed me for a violent outburst but as we are long distance I ve never been there in person to experience it and I felt like this was a reasonable decision to make I asked to speak with him and it was just like talking to a brick wall had no time for me had better things to do etc so I just sent him a long message explaining that I care greatly about him but with his temper and my personal struggles I cannot cope with the verbal abuse any longer I asked him to get help for his anger and any other issues he s been considering the possibility he has ADHD or aspergers but he refused Had another big outburst claiming that he won t put up with me calling him abusive and if it s an abusive relationship I should just leave him etc etc I left it at that hoping he d come around once he d calmed down He sent me a message the following day apologising and saying he thinks he s made a mistake that he doesn t know what he s doing and he s going to talk to his therapist I want to add now that his therapist is more of a college guidance counsellor Students talk to her about college home stress but she is not qualified to diagnose anything give medication or help with specific mental illnesses He s been seeing her for about 5 6 months and I ve noticed no change if anything he has been getting worse Anyway turns out he couldn t see her and after that he sent me a message saying he s pretty much giving up on our relationship That things will not be the same for him and this is all irreversible I was prepared for this and I felt like it was reasonable for me to walk away if he won t get help So right now I m just dealing with the fallout His friends have been supportive I ve told them the situation and they feel he has overreacted and is treating me very unfairly but at the end of the day his feelings will dictate what happens in his side of the relationship It s over I know that much is certain I now have a 600 plane ticket for the 1st of June for me to fly out and visit him again He bought me a ticket to see a concert with him and I bought an outfit for his brother s wedding He s told me that I can come but he won t go out of his way to show me a nice time I don t know what I m gonna do with this ticket I don t know what to do about any of this I m just hurting and I m tired Feeling suicidal crying all the time I m basically a mess Any advice support questions I ll be happy to answer I just need some kind of guidance or support right now amp nbsp TL DR Broke up with long distance boyfriend after a threatening outburst overwhelmed by his temper Won t get help won t listen Now have a 600 plane ticket from the UK to US that I don t know what to do with amp nbsp ALSO I should say that I have been diagnosed with BPD OCD anxiety and depression I m posting here because I m sure a lot of you know the burdens we can put on a relationship and the feelings that come with a breakup or stressful situation especially when you have BPD,Suicidal Reference
38 y o female a few days out of an inpatient fiasco Previously diagnosed as Bipolar II PTSD with a side of anxiety Once long ago it was floated that I might be borderline I scoffed at the idea Again it has been brought up I m taking it a little more seriously this time around The lack of identity The desire to be special and better and perfect and if I can t be then what is the point The rage The jealousy The reactive ability to be destroyed by rejection It all fits and I m finally on my knees It s like I woke up this spring out of a dream my youth and future gone All of a sudden I m a middle aged lady and I have no freaking idea who I am Let me tell you it s been a serious kick to the gut I m sure a few of you can relate Over the course of my life I ve attempted to get a college degree with no success I have however successfully racked up a significant amount of debt and done some major damage to my academic record It s not that I don t have the skills to achieve my academic goals but I simply failed to apply myself when I was in college I was far too busy chasing social acceptance rather than sticking my nose in books I ve been out of school for a long time now as well and I doubt I ve retained very much of what I did learn All my life it s been about being prettier wittier more loved I tried to be whoever was needed at the time and lost any semblance of personal identity along the way OK I get it Find myself I ve been in therapy for years though it wasn t addressing BPD My therapist and I were working on personal acceptance and I think it helped to an extent Even so I recognize now that I need to become independent less fear based For a long time I ve been asking myself what I want what I would like to do and I m no closer to an answer than when I started Every time I feel like I m approaching a plausible career path I see nothing but obstacles The wrecked academic record cost benefit analysis of potential accrued debt if I do go back to school no guarantee of a decent job once I get out IF I even figure out what the hell I want to do and I m still not even remotely close to an answer So how Are there any success stories out there people like me who didn t catch on to their particular reason for a hellish existence until later in life with very little in the way of a foundation for success built up around them who managed to turn things around in the third quarter of the ballgame I feel like even if I do everything right there will always be applicants that have employment histories without giant gaps academic records that are solid instead of filled with incompletes retaken courses and the random failed class here and there Or am I destined to be stuck in the minimum wage rut forever I don t know if I can stand working 40 hours a week just to pay rent buy groceries get the necessities The longest I ve ever held a job was a matter of months before I spazzed out the monotony of drudge work always allowed my brain to spiral uncontrollably and I started thinking of ways to ruin my co workers because HOW DARE THEY BE HAPPY AT WORK Rather than wreck them I inevitably wrecked myself I am in the process of searching for a DBT therapist but I m in the middle of nowhere Looks like the closest is about a 2 5 hour drive from me so I m not sure that s feasible I ve been working on mindfulness and have been utilizing the headspace app I ve been exposed to a metric crapton of experiences throughout this scattered life of mine and nothing has kept my attention for very long I honestly didn t think I d live to see 40 so I saw no point on planning for a future I don t know where to go from here For now I am living with my mom I can stay here forever I suppose and hide from the world though I know that will just lead to more depression and self loathing I ve been here since my last failed attempt at college which was seven years ago We re codependent as hell Good times TL DR I have no idea who I am and I m terrified of the future I feel like it s too late to turn my life around,Suicidal Reference

It s been a while friends hello to you all When last I checked in oh hell who remembers back that far it feels like a thousand lifetimes ago So here I am I went through another episode of abject desolation and loneliness So what did I do Fell back to r dirtypenpals amp Craigslist for some attention physical and emotional It did what it was supposed to And it also made it so much worse Met a couple for just mutual oral but they never called back after the first meet so I of course internalized it and decided I was hideous and unworthy since these obvi amazing guys didn t want to see me again sigh Well we all know that s not what really happened cognitively I knew we got what we needed out of it and we all moved on No one ever plans to see each other again Except unless they do I had posted a few times each ad a little different while I was looking to fill The Void A virtual boyfriend friends with benefits just company just physical it was all there As a woman I got tons of responses which was cool Thinner the herd and wound up with some crazies but met a few genuinely nice guys A couple were in over their heads or not sure what they wanted But we were all looking There was one guy I liked a bit We talked by chat every day since we met and then we actually met and it went well He was so sweet and innocent I didn t want to scare him off so I let him set the pace We tried to meet Friday but his sitter fell through and we cancelled We still talked though Friday night until we said good night I sent him the usual good morning text and I never heard back from him Still haven t I did what any good person in borderline recovery would do I sent an email last night telling him I hoped he was ok but if he changed his mind about us I would respect that I left it at that He hadn t written back yet and I ve seen him online at Hangouts I will stop checking it eventually and it isn t the first time one has disappeared It just sucks when it does It s when The Void comes back So back to Craigslist to look around but it s only halfhearted really I doubt I ll replace him immediately I haven t fully grieved the loss yet I decided to try to talk to my SO the way I talked to these other guys still not the same We ve slipped into the standard banality of long term relationships I have surgery coming up soon to fix my knee Some other things are falling apart and others are coming together I have my annual exam in a couple of weeks and I ll pray that despite my self destructive behaviors I m still STI free I ve gone back to the gym after eating like shit to try to drown my disappointment over losing my companion this Friday On the bright side I was only briefly tempted to self injure and I have talked to our EAP to set up therapy again Not sure why maybe to deal with my daddy issues Or maybe it s just an excuse Who knows I had to get this out though it was choking me and only you would understand the feeling everything all at once while being so disassociated you feel nothing Here we go again,Suicidal Reference
I just stood on a bridge staring death in the face At this point my mind tells me the rational choice is to kill myself I will suffer if I stay alive I will continue to endure the relentless pain I ve been feeling for three months now However I can choose death and with certainty end the pain and thus give myself dignity I would want no one I love to have to endure pain like this I feel less than a human being I am less I ve never been given love I ve never been treated like I was worth anything I m not worth anything I m a piece of trash that gets used and taken advantage of by others Meanwhile this bridge lives in my mind constantly To die with dignity To choose death as a means of brining pain and suffering to an end And I m still here I m still here ready to let my body begin living again while my mind remains locked in hell My mind is a machine of torture I can t endure this This is pure suffering Suffering for the sake of suffering To choose death as the sole heroic act I can choose and thus to make my final act and moment one of dignity and joy,Suicidal Reference
I don t know if I m doing any of this right I m anti social to the max even on the internet so I ve never been on Reddit before I didn t even have a Tumblr until recently I m 18 years old and I was diagnosed with BPD a little over a year ago I ve known a few people with BPD but I never connected with them maybe because they were all males and I have issues with men As days go by I feel more and more alone I feel like more of a freak and I just feel like I m breaking apart I know that sounds dramatic and silly but I feel like I m going crazy I have a lot of problems with substance abuse I will abuse any substance I can get my hands on and the older I get the worse the urge to do more gets I used to love the taste of alcohol now I have to force myself to drink it I used to enjoy a smoke now and then now I smoke 5 in one go just to dull the need I was always scared of screwing myself up by using drugs now I ll take as many pain killers as I can just to dull my senses Pain is all that my life seems to be about my body is covered in scars and each day I only cause more I feel like everything I do is going nowhere I talk to my friends and they either make me feel like I m making a big deal out of nothing or they make me feel like all I have to do is choose to stop Is it that simple though It feels like there s this driving force that s constantly silently pushing me screaming at me to do something but I never know what I drink and do whatever I can to dull the crippling need for something that I don t even know I feel like I m meant to know what to do how to fix myself My mother has always told me that I m the only one that can fix me I have to do the work because no one else can But I don t know what work I need to do I don t know what parts of me I need to fix because BPD isn t just one thing it s my personality it s me It feels impossible to separate myself from it I ve lost the person I was without it that is if there even was a me without it I don t know why I m writing this I m just desperate at this point It s become every night that I feel like I m screaming internally I sit out on my driveway and look at my contacts in my phone while having a smoke or 5 and I feel this intense loneliness because I know there isn t one person I can tall or text who would understand My father s been the only person in my life to be relatable and he s one of the reasons I m so screwed up I love my father something fierce but he mentally beat me down so far I was just a pathetic victim Anyway I m getting way off track like there even is a track I can t keep a routine in my household I m the one who does the housework because my housemates have physical issues but I fail horribly I have this bubbling anger towards everyone and everything I don t want to be around anyone or anything but at the same time I feel the opposite I m so tired I m tired of feeling such intense emotions and having to control my mind emotions reactions I m so scared of hurting other people emotionally because I lose control no one would understand if I did and I would hate myself so much because it isn t fair that they should have to deal with something that isn t their problem I m tired of feeling empty dull numb I want to claw at my skin just to feel something but sometimes even my skin feels numb I have severe depression and even more severe anxiety and countless other issues so I m confused as to whether these things are BPD or something else My minds so messed up right now I hate reaching out but I feel like I lost little kid right now,Suicidal Reference
This is my first post here so I m sorry if something is wrong or has already been discussed I m generally a good person but sometimes I struggle with these terrible horrible evil thoughts that I cannot control I hate them and they make me hate myself more than I already do I sometimes wish really bad things on people even the ones that I love the most Sometimes I find myself wishing my best friend who is often suicidal would actually kill herself so that I had a reason to do it myself and not feel like I am failing her When she tells me she feels like she wants to kill herself and I m trying to talk her out of it sometimes I m really thinking Well let s just do it so we can both finally end the suffering Does anyone have a similar experience Am I just a terrible person I feel like if I just died I would make the world a better place because there would be less evil in it,Suicidal Reference
In an attempt to trigger myself self sabotage is baaaaad by the way don t do it I ran into a website where a certain female psychologist was talking about people with BPD and NPD The things she had to say were well She referred to them as abusive personality disorders for one talked about the many many many many times she s seen men who have been abused by their wives with BPD or as she called them BPD wives numerous comments and stories were added about how horrible BPD people are talked about the subtle differences between NPD and BPD neither of us are capable of feeling empathy though in our case we can have fleeting moments of it if we re reminded of times we were sad but it looks like people are able to feel sorry for us essentially we re basically the same abusive and awful Other things said about people with BPD include a child should not be allowed to parent a child nah actually they re not like children children aren t genuinely intentionally malicious if a BPD really can t help it then why do they turn into the perfect person when they want something or they decide to be nice or they think you ll leave them suddenly POOF they re everything you want them to be and more I ve never wanted to kill myself so much seeing a psychologist and numerous numerous people talk about how awful I am and how I don t really have a prognosis to speak of and things like that It makes me feel like so many people think a BPD Holocaust would be perfectly reasonable and it just I just want to die before I hurt anyone else I just want to kill myself so I don t abuse anyone anymore because I don t see myself as getting better Ever I m afraid of treatment as therapy is a weapon that I d just use to continue the cycle of abuse and hate like they said Moreover that part of me that wants to get better It s just not there It s not there I don t care enough But I m also scared to die I ve got a splitting headache and I just want to be normal,Suicidal Reference
Sometimes when I m with other people I can be the shinier and better version of myself sure I ll still lash out at people or have mood swings but it won t be AS BAD Then I m alone and it feels like no one ever talks to me as if I ll always be mentally ill as if everything is hopeless and occasionally I am not entirely sure if I am here I think about self harming again whether or not certain drugs would block out the pain so that I could kill myself properly Even when I m okay I m never content I am always trying to find an identity Always trying to change something until it clicks But alone depressed starting to hate no longer caring about myself it feels as if the only way I ll ever be okay is if I use people as crutches Because with them I can be beautiful and strong and mysterious and unique and I don t know how to function without external pain of any kind so I become the source of my own pain Sometimes it feels like recovery isn t real I ve gotten better and many people see it but then I am by myself and everything is bad again,Suicidal Reference
I have recently been diagnosed with BPD after dealing with depression and anxiety for a long time now Before my diagnoses I already decided I was going go to a partial due to the need to always harm myself and the suicidal thoughts that control my life I guess I am just worried about the whole thing I just don t fully know what is going to happen while I am there and what activities I will have to take part of I hate not knowing what is going to happen I know I have to go but I keep talking myself out of it I think I will feel better with more information Is there anyone that has gone through this or know of someone who has Can you clue me in,Suicidal Reference
When I was a kid I was never allowed to be angry at my parents Every time I even suggested that they did something I didn t like they would beat me I also got sad a lot when I was younger and didn t know why When my mom would ask what was wrong and I said I didn t know she would yell at me So I would blame my sadness on a dead pet She would then tell me that I was wrong and that that s not why I was sad And then she would yell at me when I couldn t give her another answer To this day I m not allowed to be upset Every time I try to tell my parents how I feel my mom says oh stop or oh please and my dad just says it s bullshit But when they ask me why I m upset and I don t tell them they yell at me I can t deal with this anymore I feel so frustrated and horrible every time I m around them because whenever I m with them they insult me or make fun of me or point out every little thing that s wrong with me It s gotten to the point where I am upset with myself for feeling anything The only way I can deal with being upset is cutting myself and then I just have the added stress of hiding my cuts from them because if they find out about that I cut they ll yell at me In fifth grade the school called my mother and told her that I was suicidal She came home and yelled at me and my dad didn t speak to me for weeks Last year my senior year of high school the school called and told my parents I was suicidal My dad told me I was blowing it out of proportion and that I was fine Every time I get upset in front of him he yells at me and I can t take it anymore I ve considered killing myself so many times in the past week just so I won t have to deal with this anymore,Suicidal Reference
Huge long deflated sigh My mental illness is in full swing My husband is now fully aware of it intellectually I get the sense that the gravity of what that means of the past three years and what that means for the future has not fully hit him yet in his emotional mind I told him that I read that some people recover in a year I think that is why he is staying with me I didn t mention that some people never recover The thing I never understood about suicide hotlines is that apparently people feel suicidal in a big dramatic way and not just a low level of it constantly Like do I call them now or is there going to be a time in the future when I m like holding a knife to my wrist and I m like crap We were walking to the train and there was a furniture store and right in the doorway onto the sidewalk there was a table for sale It was a log that had been shaved into a table top with some wrought iron hairpin legs I gasped and said Wow look at this table how cool He said It looks unfinished I just wanted to show him the table that I liked I didn t want to buy it or spend any money on furniture I do actually want a bed frame and not just a mattress but I m ok with not getting one until he is ok buying one I just wanted to point out the table and say look table log hairpin legs cool to share the aesthetic He was not into it I think I was projecting just then Like about money I just assumed he was thinking about money I don t get it because I used to actually be poor I am more worried about money now than I was when I made 9 an hour working 25 hours a week Anyways I feel like my husband is so fundamentally different from me How could he ever love me We didn t have sex tonight and I honestly can t tell if it s because I didn t approach him out of fear of rejection or he was just exhausted after our completely draining and fucked up day week month years I can never tell what he s thinking I just want to be good I want to take the bad parts out When I love myself I feel so good I feel like I am a beam of light and everything feels perfect When I hate myself my face feels like it was run over by a truck I ll probably have some fucked up dreams tonight and tomorrow cancel my plans for the day and repeat today but worse The next day will be worse I am sucked into it again I sincerely hope I can get out of it magically by the time I wake up Good night you are special,Suicidal Reference
I don t know what to do On the surface life is great I just got a promotion at work currently a student and most importantly I have a wife who loves me more than I could ever hope for Underneath the surface is just a mess Some days are good some days bad but today is HORRIBLE I ve had a good week with my promotion and have handled my responsibilities well Out of nowhere today it feels like just too much I just started the new position on Monday so resigning this early isn t an option I don t know what my problem is It s so bad today that I texted my wife and asked her to hide my gun before I get home All I can think about is how I don t want to see tomorrow,Suicidal Reference
Sorry if this is a wall of text I haven t learnt how to format properly please bear with me though The thought of doing normal things that most people do want to do in life eg Courting getting a bf marriage mortgage kids etc makes me want to top myself now So I engage in reckless activities eg Drugs i dont even care which I just want to be out of my head sex purely for pleasure self esteem and feeling wanted Trusting complete strangers all the time spending I can t see myself in a week let alone a year I I do things that i know are bad for me physically and mentally but It doesn t deter me When i look at myself in the mirror it feels as if there s no one there I love feeling empty and numb because it means i don t have to feel unwanted and like a failure of a human being I rely on other peoples opinions on me for self esteem and go out of my way to avoid conflict After reading some posts on this sub I totally agree that it s hard for someone to love you if you don t love yourself also the black and white thinking After being cheated on multiple times It s almost impossible to admit i have feelings for someone out of fear of rejection and embarrassment I try to please everyone and never get grumpy or snappy at people other than myself this is because I have learnt people like happy positive people not negativity Sorry for sounding like a downer I write this not because i am sad but because I feel this community of people may understand and offer some insight if so I would love to talk to a like minded person mainly just for the reassurance that my brain is not broken and restore a little bit of hope,Suicidal Reference
Hey guys first time posting on reddit ever Also not a throwaway Had my first psych consult yesterday got diagnosed for a depressive episode I understand where the doc s coming from because yesterday was a really good day and whatever I said weren t really the true symptoms my experiences were a lot more dysfunctional than I related to him couldn t evoke recall the feelings only facts For example he asked about how I dealt with disappointment and I just brushed it off as accepting what went wrong and moving on If only that were the truth I take it on in reality as a literal physical shock then a lot of mental negotiation and then do I accept what happened all in the matter of minutes to hours It s like I go through the grief process for every minor disappointment The good day was also the weirdest good day as well It s good compared to the last two nights where I was full on suicidal in that I didn t really wanna kill myself anymore But I m right smack in the middle of my exams and just printing out my readings was quite about as much as I could manage Everything I read just went over my head I couldn t feel anything as well Like I wasn t the super horny elated aggrieved hyper panicky self that I normally am Was still quite restless though had to keep checking Google maps on the bus there to make sure I m moving I don t know I feel like I just kind of mimicked the way in which I want to come off to people I ve newly met I mean whatever I said during the session felt like the truth because I ve fully embodied that persona Totally not the best way to seek help from a professional and it left me a lot of thoughts during my trip home about how I wasn t purely honest and wasn t helping myself by doing that I know that BPD usually requires more than one session to suss out also because I m so inconsistent but im starting to feel like I m wasting everyone s time I m seeing him again in two weeks to see how my 10mg florexitine is working out so how best should I prepare myself from now until then Also should I feel this way about what I said to him Only starting my antidepressants today not sure how that would change things either Ps I m being reviewed under my local Child Guidance Clinic but I m already 18 Do you think this would affect my final diagnosis if it s really BPD,Suicidal Reference
As a lot of you might know one characteristic of BPD is feeling emotions deeply and for an extended period of time I ve been really ashamed to talk about this but a girl indirectly caused me to delete my instagram It was a girl that my boyfriend had a crush on and the thought of it has never left my mind ever since he had told me roughly 4 years ago Every time she would post up a selfie I would slip into a really deep depression that made me completely inactive for hours or sometimes an entire day It got to a point where I started starving myself causing me to be under 100 pounds This is just one of the many things that fuel my rage and anger the most and I am just so goddamn fucking tired of living like this I still try to seek out her pictures even though I ve deleted my account I m so angry at the way my mind works and how it is so difficult for me to let go of negative situations as minuscule as this I feel like if I weren t this way I would have achieved my full potential in college Instead I feel like I can characterize my childhood teenhood and young adulthood as insecure angry and sad,Suicidal Reference
Everything went very weird I m still not really sure I have an exam tomorrow and I was revising for it It struck me that I don t know anything at all on the exam I mean literally nothing even after all the revision and I went into this massive panic attack I ve been at rock bottom all year which has affected grades plus I missed one of my other exams the other day If I fail I get kicked out then everyone will want to know why I got kicked out and they ll find out about my mental health and have me shut away Trust me that s what my family will do the last time my mum heard anything was wrong with me she started talking about trying to get me institutionalised and I was nowhere near as bad as I am right now I mention this so none of you tell me to talk to my family because they will not listen I have tried I had this panic attack and was overcome with this really intense need to kill myself I mean suicidal thoughts are common for me but the urge to do it was so strong I could barely control my arms I managed to tell my friend L who I was messaging at the time and he got me to video call on Skype That s where things started going really weird I remember I was hyperventilating a lot but I slowed down Then I don t really remember At some point I started talking to myself and this is what gets me It s not like I m hearing a voice like an actual auditory hallucination I ve researched hallucinations and stuff a lot and it wasn t like that it was inside my head It was me but a me I don t think about very much In conceptualising my head I tend to feel like there s two of me There s the me that s typing this out and gets to control my mouth and run day to day activities so called Rational Me and then there s the other one Usually it s dismissable as that voice everyone has in their heads and maybe it is and ive just tripped myself out about it I don t know But that one the second one it got out I started talking and I was both of them and I could feel it wanting me to die It started telling me everyone was lying and saying all this stuff and L could hear me saying it and worked out what was going on and started denying it it kept saying he was lying and doesn t care about me but it just kept saying he wasn t real and that Rational Me isn t real only it truly exists This kept going for ages I don t remember why but I got furious at this poster on my wall and I tore it down and ripped it into shreds I think because the walls looked like they were closing in Sometimes I was laughing sometimes I was crying It kept making me talk quietly because L had taken sleeping pills earlier he has insomnia and is several hours ahead he lives abroad right now and it knew I d have to be loud to keep him awake But he fell asleep I d gotten my other friend P to message me but then he just stopped replying after he promised he wouldn t he claims he s there reading his phone but I told him I was at high risk of killing myself and he s not even checked if I m still there in the past hour or so which really hurts because he got so upset when I said I couldn t trust him to be there for me especially because when I call him out on it he always gets all defensive like it s my fault he can t just fucking say he might not answer for a short while and just leaves me hanging I m sort of calm now I don t know I drank a lot so I can t really move which is something but I ended up cutting a lot The anxiety keeps coming back because I know how many hours of revision I missed and how crucial they were I haven t eaten today I don t really want to My head hurts a lot because I hit it on my knees and the wall a couple of times and I cried so there s no water in there to work against all the vodka What s worrying me is the voice I don t know whether it s something I should count towards evidence of psychosis because I know a psychotic break lasts longer than a few hours and I know the voice was me but I couldn t control it and I still can t truly understand it as myself it feels like a separate entity and it felt like someone else was in my head watching until I calmed down It s that and the laughing I d go from crying to laughing to nothing in the space of a minute I wouldn t know why I was laughing I don t know what I was feeling I don t really remember what was said only that the voice was nasty and wanted me to keep drinking I just want to know what people know about psychosis and psychotic symptoms with BPD EDIT L is awake now and I asked him what happened He said that I was talking a lot but it wasn t you It was trying to kill you,Suicidal Reference

I ve felt like this a lot recently And feeling so down and so out of it on top of that There s a tipping point I guess with my ir rational reasoning Do I deserve it Am I worth the effort it will take to complete the action Will it change anything in the long run And recently it s no and no and no Normally me gt effort trouble by a small margin but lately it s me lt effort trouble on a huge scale Everything I have to do feels so huge and I feel so tiny I bathe sparingly I eat sparingly Just enough to keep myself alive I m frustrated by the tiniest little setbacks and I give up frequently I m cutting a lot and I can t even bring myself to ask for help because I feel like people will say no because I m more trouble than I m worth,Suicidal Reference
im a student its in the middle of our last week of finals right now im so stressed out i know i always mess up my grades so this year i was so determined ive kept my grades up all year which is good but now theres the added pressure of doing well on the final exam worth so much of our total grade and lock in those grades im so stressed it takes so much energy to convince myself to leave the house to buy food so much anxiety and general paranoia people are following me to hurt me im just so stressed theres so much to do and i dont have that many friends but my idealized person is my best friend who hasnt been answering texts for 3 days hes either really busy studying or tired of being my friend which is probably the reason so i dont wanna text him again to not bother him but he is the only person i can talk to as my idealized person i only feel safe talking to him if that makes sense i know im such a bad friend so i dont wanna bother but just my thoughts are so intense and my feelings and im always at the brink of honestly contemplating killing myself at any little thing that goes wrong,Suicidal Reference

Hi ive been in hospital twice now The first time was 2 years ago for a suicide attempt and this last time was about a month ago I wasnt trying to kill myself but i was having thoughts and i was trying to harm myself and it probably wouldnt have gotten that bad if i was able to voluntarily admit myself I had called Kaiser a day prior to see what hospitals i could go to before my problem escalated especially with how fucking long Kaiser takes to book you with a psychiatrist But i was jerked around until someome finally told me the only way to get admitted was to go through the ER which is considered involuntary I just wanted to get help and it turned into this whole thing im starting to feel the need to go again but i dont want to go involuntarily has anyone had problems like this before or have any insight,Suicidal Reference
I ve never gotten along with my abusive brother Even when I m splitting and idealizing him I still hate him just not as much At best it s neutral For a while the only way we communicated was yelling I don t know what the hell is wrong with him if he has the same fucking curse that we do but his temper is ridiculous After dealing with this shit for years I realized something the silent treatment is the only way to avoid conflict with him Once you open your mouth and say something he says something twice as loud cunty and vindictive back The more you talk the crazier the two of you get until he s throwing fists and hyperventilating and you re trying to hide behind the door with holes in it Once I figured this out I thought I was fucking set I thought I finally solved the problem of our relationship or at the very least put a decent band aid on it It was almost surreal to be interacting with him all those months and not be slitting my wrists because I don t know what else to do with the rage of having to deal with more of his shit and not being able to take it anymore We were on good terms even Sure it was stilted and horribly awkward but we weren t at each other s throats But no These past few weeks I ve been slowly getting angry and angrier I m trying so fucking hard to keep composure but I can t The slightest thing and I fly off the handle again I can t fucking help it Even after all these months I didn t solve anything I put on a band aid and the band aid fucking fell off I ve blown up five times now and this month is barely half way over I can t fucking take it I hate him so fucking much right now I hate myself I hate everything,Suicidal Reference
1 I remember not wanting to be with a therapist anymore after she disagreed with me about unconditional love Only mothers can love their children unconditionally I thought it was bullshit and I get upset easily I know it sounds silly to other people 2 Most recent example I did an intake at a mental health place Your new therapist will call you soon So I kept waiting getting more frustrated and thinking I was rejected and they didn t bother to tell me Then after 6 days I left the lady a voice mail to the effect of New therapist guy hasn t called me can you call me or make him do it So the next day he did After a week I feel like most people would not give a shit if their new therapist took a week to call them but I might have to adjust my one class schedule also it feels like maybe I was so awful that he didn t want to take the case Like maybe he d never call or just forget or something I don t know if it s normal to freak out after a week of waiting for a call If he has time to take a new case can t he call It feels like I m already biased against him I tried to rationally calm myself down but UGH I tried so hard and might finally get DBT but I wanted to get it all sorted out before my resolve changed too He s a DBT therapist Someone I know said It d be awful if he were a therapist for people with abandonment issues Me Yeah that s often a part of BPD 3 Another example I had a therapist at this one place and it seemed like other therapists were calling a patient crazy etc and it sounded rude to me so I didn t feel safe there anymore 4 Another time the therapist told her supervisor that I was going to kill myself on Halloween because I expressed suicidal thoughts and was excited for Halloween forever my favorite holiday So fuck you lady Don t try to ruin my precious COULD BE A GOOD DAY FOR ONCE Can anyone relate I never know if I m being fair or freaking out over nothing Sometimes they seem condescending assholes etc and then I m just done with them Like fuck you I tried my best to give you a chance but then you ehh I don t usually express it all the way though and lash out Try to hold most of it in Also sometimes they just seem like idiots I know that sounds harsh and judgmental but they ve honestly never seem helpful HERE S A RANDOM DIAGNOSIS ALSO WE HAVE A PSYCH HAVE SOME MEDS WOOO THEY LL FIX YOU RIGHT UP I think I respected one therapist maybe but I liked her too much for me to be honest She was an interesting old lady I can respect someone without liking them a lot but I haven t felt the respect trust etc with a therapist very often It usually feels like they don t try to understand their patient or actually help They expect you to be all better and do all of your goals just by asking you some questions every week This is a bit of a rant but I d still like to hear other opinions P Maybe you all can get me,Suicidal Reference
because there are so many upsides I mean yeah it fucking sucks that I had to call out of work today and pretend to be sick because I m an anxious wreck I suppose I should clarify that my partner called for me because I couldn t even call myself BUT on the other hand I think I m thankful for being this way Sure life sucks and is way more difficult for me than it should be Yet I can tell that in many ways my experience is better than the average person s My impaired emotional processing also means that I feel positive emotions more strongly I Äôm easily entertained easily impressed and enjoy nice things more than most people I laugh longer and louder at the simplest of jokes Äîwhich makes people like me because I make them feel funny Funny things are always 100x funnier things that are neat to most people are awe inspiring for me I Äôm easily and completely overwhelmed in instances where most people go Äúoh cool Äù Movies affect me more Theme parks and big malls still move me like it s the first time I m seeing one The tiniest gesture of kindness feels indescribably loving Swimming in the ocean feels almost spiritual for me even if the beach is dirty and crowded with tourists The bad stuff is stronger But I don t know if I would trade In my lowest moments I sometimes do Hell I want to kill myself in my lowest moments just to avoid being the way I am But I know in my heart that I wouldn t want to be any different I m learning coping skills that help me through the bad times and mindfulness that makes me see all these good sides to the way my brain works Just feeling hopeful despite my shitty day and felt I should post something positive here for once lt 3,Suicidal Reference
Being more self aware and trying to implement mindfulness I m becoming aware of issues I ve always had and it seems to be apparent more now than ever I have become close with someone over the past couple of months We aren t dating but we are currently on the same page we both really don t know what is happening but despite where it goes friends first She s a social worker and also has mental health issues as well We have both opened up to each other and have been communicating honestly about the past feelings etc One thing that I ve found very frustrating the past couple weeks is the overwhelming empathy and confusion on how to handle anything She is experiencing real life issues that is also triggering past bad experiences in her life I have been there for her and I am beginning to sort of spiral I feel intense empathy and feel like I need to do something because it s getting worse I know that it s my emotions and that I can t solve these problems but I can t help but feel this way Because we re all about honesty I feel more and more selfish saying that what she s going through is affecting me It s getting to the point where I am starting to self harm and not sure what to do I have been sharing all this with her but it s getting to the point where I don t know what to do I want to be there but I also need to take care of myself Does anyone else have similar experiences or this particularly frustrating situation Any good ways to cope or communicate to each other such that both people feel comforted I am so trying not to spin what she s going through on me and it s making me feel so guilty for feeling the way I do I ve had both bad close and friendship relationships where the other person is not empathetic selfish co opt their identity to all the bad things that happen to them or any combinations of these but this isn t that type of relationship I believe her when she says she cares and have been comforted by her I just wanted to point out this isn t a one way relationship I ve gotten much better at eliminating those types of people from my life and this isn t the case,Suicidal Reference

I can t remember what the name is or if it has one What I mean is you know how you can have one mood for a couple of hours and then another on your average BPD day but sometimes it goes rapid fire Like right now for the past hour or so I ve been doing 5 minutes of suicidal self loathing and fury 5 minutes of giggly happiness 5 minutes of emptiness 5 minutes of rage 5 minutes of contentment and so on,Suicidal Reference
I have no idea what to do with myself anymore Recently another hysterical and drunken episode with my boyfriend and family has made me lose all hope of myself These episodes consist of outbursts of ridiculous black out rage followed by hatred of myself and a shitty attempt of suicide I then franticly cry and cry about how I continuously make mistakes and go in circles saying that I don Äôt deserve to live because I am not good enough and constantly fail at life These episodes are always the same They bring out my true feelings of guilt and hatred of myself that I attempt to mask everyday with trying to live a normal life and have a normal relationship with myself boyfriend and family The thing is I seriously am not good at life I hate myself and what I Äôve become and I Äôm sick of attempting to get better My constant changing of my perception of self my drastic mood swings that completely alter my perception of reality The extreme instability of my thoughts and feelings Everyday I am either picking up the pieces of another failed attempt at life or telling myself that today will be different and that I can do this I Äôm tired of just forcing myself to try everyday its a constant struggle to work to take care of myself to have any kind of productivity I just am lost I am so empty I have no sense of self I have no interests or skills I can Äôt make relationships because its too hard to Äúbe myself Äù with of others when I don Äôt know who I am I can Äôt keep a job because I can Äôt commit to anything and feel terrified of failure And I am sick of telling myself things will get better and I will find my passion and learn how to live a normal life because it is just untrue I am in a constant battle with my thoughts and self to be better while I simultaneously self destruct I wish I could explain my thoughts in my head to others but this is about as good as I can do I just am so tired of constant failure in every aspect I want to be normal I want to love myself I want to be able to cope when stressors happen instead of seeing the world end before my eyes I am a 21 year old woman who is aimlessly going through her life overcome with hatred that I can Äôt get things right in any aspect I truly feel worthless in this life I don Äôt want to continue on with my rollercoaster moods and realities I have no control over my life anymore I have been taken over by my BPD and the worst part is no one understands what it is like My loved ones just think I Äôm insane I have no health insurance or money right now to get therapy or medications So I just have no idea how to live anymore Im so lost in this world of BPD that I can Äôt believe in myself when I say that I can get better I have proven that wrong countless times I was diagnosed with BPD about a year ago Before I turned 21 I was only diagnosed with depression about 10 years ago and ADHD about 4 years ago I just want someone to understand my thoughts and mind To help me because I honestly don Äôt believe I can help myself anymore,Suicidal Reference
Has anyone with BPD found happiness with the right person I have had the worst relationship of my entire life these last 4 5 years and I lost myself completely and I went into full blown BPD I have never been this bad in any other relationship I would cry rage have intense emotional breakdowns crippling depression and sought out drugs to help me numb the pain I was never like this before with any other guy He hurt me so many times with other girls lying and disrespecting me In the beginning he told me his best friend was a female friend that he used to date She was a former student of his and had even worked in his lab He talked about her all of the time and she was incredibly sexy and bisexual and free He would ask me thinks like is it okay if she sleeps over as friends or tell me how she wants to see me naked I felt so uncomfortable about this and later on I would find out that they were not best friends They hung out 3 times since he had been single right before me and he tried to be with her but she was seeing someone I was wrong to feel so jealous of her because in the end he didn t want her in the end I believe however I was more bothered that once he saw and I was not really comfortable with her he decided to just hide her and hide hanging out with her Rather then ask me why I felt threatened he just assumed I was too jealous and controlling and ignored the situation I gave up my place and furniture and I moved in with him I began to see his lies and him hiding people There were several other girls students that he used to sleep with or girls who he really liked and tried to date before me He had one former student stunning blonde with huge tits lets call her Barb and who really like him but she was too much for him he slept with her off and on in his other relationship and she wanted more so he had to stop He never told me about her once I found out about her because I saw the texts She apparently did not want to hear about me at all she was too jealous The texts were flirty in nature and there were tons of holes in the messages meaning he deleted specific texts with her I asked him about it and told him how much it hurt me At the time I was studying for my comprehensive exams and I was really stressed and the nights I spent studying is when they would text all night I became obsessed with her and we would fight about it He would text her during our fights and tell her that I am crazy and fighting with him for no reason She and him would laugh and call me a crazy bitch He never told I her I was upset that he was hiding her The worst part is she is a therapist and had to know that texting a guy who is living with somoeone and flirting with him is not right especially when she wants nothing to do with me After this I found out about another girl and I was a emotional wreck at this point I felt trapped having no furniture or place to move into I cried all of the time and I drank at night before he came home because I did not know how to be around him He kept telling me I was insane and he was not doing anything but talking to some friends This is what he told everyone in his life I was angry because of these friends Not that these were his former lovers and girls he had really liked He made me feel like I was crazy for this and convinced me and all his friends it was all me I actually did go crazy as a result We broke up but then we got back together because he said he loved me and was sorry I spent a few days crying and explaining why Barb in particular hurt me and how important honestly is I told him how vulnerable I was and how much this had been impacting me I thought he understood Also during this time he wanted to try swinging and he told me it would be good for me and my jealousy issues We started swinging and I become a bit more insecure and told him that if we have a open sexual relationship that trust and honestly are essential A few months into us being back together he starts talking to Barb behind my back He had apparently lied to her before saying we had not gotten back together and when I found out he was talking to her again behind my back he told me I was crazy and he had to hide her That I was getting upset because of a few texts I a span of a week he had texted her like 8 times and talked on the phone 3 times I broke up with him but I was a shell of a person at this point I told him he needs to text her and explain the situation and tell her that he loves me and needs to take time away from talking to her to repair the damage of the lies He refused said I was making demands of him and he will not be controlled I leave and go to my grandfather s place We talk a lot and I agree to see him a week later We rebound and connect again He tells me she is not a threat and she is not around and he was suppose to go to a wedding for my family that weekend so we decide to stick with that plan IN route to the wedding I see a message pop up on his phone reminding him to call back Barb My heart races and I manage to look at his texts and I see that the day after we broke up she came over his place I feel sick to my stomach my palms are sweating and my heart is beating a million times a minute I take Xanex and drink a lot he ignores me the whole night and stays on his phone He actually took pictures of himself in his suit and sent them to Barb We get back to his place where my car is and I go into a rage induced episode and I lash out at him Months of playing with my emotions fucking me over with the same girl and I just lose my shit I leave again and I vow to never look at that disgusting lying face of his He killed me emotionally and I was trying to pick up the pieces of my life and after a few months I had to go to his place and move my fish tank While I am there I cry a lot and we talk and he asks to see me at the place we had our first date I meet him and he tells me he loves me so much and he is so sorry about Barb that he realizes that his actions were hurtful and he should of told me about her He said he only wants me I fall for it hook line and sinker My heart feels so deep a love and I feel so happy to hear him say that to me I had been dating a few guys at that point but no one I liked liked Once we slept together I told him everything and told him that I love him only and I didnt want to see these other guys anyone more A few days before that he had meet a girl and he liked her enough to kiss her that night This was two days after our date and him telling me he loves me He says he didnt get to date girls and he is jealous that I was dating I spent the night at his place and I told him I didnt want to see these guys again because I love him and only him He tells me he is not sure he can commit fully because of last time I had a date on Tuesday so I asked him about me going and he said he not really thrilled so I told my ex I can just cancel the date and he said okay I leave that morning and before I go I went to the store and brought him some stuff so he had some food when he got home He decided after work to go to this girls house for a date and does not understand why I am so upset After I finally get him to tell me what I wanted to hear for so long he starts fucking dating another girl I feel like this is a sick dream of sorts this cant actually be happening I went from cloud nine to the lowest of lows To cope I did what many BPD do I made dates that weekend with all of the guys I was seeing just back to back dates I wanted to numb my pain with sex and rub into my exs face Yeah not healthy behavior at all He sees this new girl over the weekend and sleeps with her but he can not stand the thought that I have these three guys and he caves and tells me he picks me and he dosent like her My dates over the weekend involved a lot of me crying about my ex and I was so unhappy I was really hurt that he could date someone after telling me how much he loved me after seeing how much it hurts me after breaking up because of his inability to be honest and respect my feelings I am an emotional bowl of pudding that cries all the time I agree to meet him and we talk and love each other again He says he is sorry that he only wants me I ask him to end it with her before he goes back home town for the holidays He refuses to says not now and i break down thinking this is just another game of his If he dosent like her at all and wants me why cant he just text her and say he cant date right now or something along those lines We are at a bar at the time and I lose my shit I take a half bottle of Xanex and drink more and end up in the hospital I am so depressed and not myself and he seemed to be there for me afterwards I thought maybe he could see that his action were having a deeply negative effect on me and my mental health and he would stop He ends up being there for me but texting his ex and those other girls and telling them I am crazy I did not know this until later We go on a trip around new years and that girl texts him about hanging out the one I asked him to end it with He says fine and sends her a text one he didnt know I was going to see it says that he has to deal with an emotionally unstable ex who is going through some issues so he has to help me She replies You once told me that I was a breathe of fresh air that being around me makes you happy Just know that I am there for you if you need me This is from a girl that he had no interest in he says someone he just slept with to get back at me for sleeping with guys when we were not together I cry when I read this and I get angry This was not the only girl he told that to We get back together but there other girls and other issues His ex of 4 years moves back here and starts working with him She doesn t want anything to do with me because he told her I was crazy and because it hurt her that he moved on I m not allowed at functions or get togethers for his job Worse we have to watch her dog the dog they got together I tell him I am okay watching the dog however I want her to be able to either the dog off or pick the dog up It s crazy that you have to drive to her place and pick the dog up and drop it off because she cant come here He says maybe if I didnt act crazy before she could come here but he doesn t want to fight I say okay then tell her you can not have the dog here because of that he tells me do you know how crazy you sound It s my house and my decision You do not like it then leave Her dogs stays with us 5 times over the course of less then a year and not once does she pick up or drop the dog off when I am around After one fight about the dog he promises to have her come to our place and pick up the dog however she is home all day but he tells her not to come until I have to go to work later that night Then he tells me he did what I said and had her come here not even realizing that it was me being there and not being invisible or hiding from his ex that was the issue and her coming to the house when I am not there defeats the purpose He says it s my house and I do not want her to come here if you re around We break up again and I am at an all time low The years of dealing with this shit have taken there toll on my mental health and I have no job no place to live and a ph c in psychology because I couldn t manage to finish my dissertation I am so alone and unhappy he started dating this last break up immediately after I left He texts me he loves me still and no one can compare to me I am alone and confused and he knows how much I love him I just spent the weekend with him naked embraced in love and while I was there with him I found out that he was texting another girl to come over as soon as I left He told me he has to work and needs me to go back home on Sunday but that was a lie I know he is dating and I can not do anything but the fact that it was the only girl I was really jealous of he is dating like 5 different girls and the fact that he did it when I was with him when I thought it was a safe love zone I know that s silly but I felt betrayed I flipped out worse than I ever flipped out before I had so much emotion and I was drinking and I just erupted and went insane for the night I feel terrible that I did this and I am so embarrassed for my actions He kicked me out and told me that I am never ever allowed at his place again I know that he is no good for me and is not what I need but I also wonder how much of this is my fault How I could have been better believed in him trusted that he was not going to cheat on me Maybe I did cause him to lie to me Maybe it s okay to have these other girls around and I am crazy for my jealousy Could we have been happy if I was normal I feel that being in love and living with someone requires honestly and a caring if your actions hurt someone I wish I did not have to go insane and I am now a day later from my breakdown and I am so depressed I want to die I just rambled and I am sorry I guess I needed to just get that all out Summary Has anyone with BPD found happiness in a relationship with the right guy,Suicidal Reference
After two hospitalizations in one month due to self harm and alcoholism my SO has stuck through all of it with me kinda He talks to me daily we hang out occasionally but we don t sleepover or share any intimacy anymore hand holding kissing saying i love you I kept bugging him about it when I finally got back to the city where we live and he finally said we are not in a romantic relationship and that I have to prove to him that I am a happy person and that I am seeking to better myself but there are no guarantees we ll ever have a romantic relationship again and he doesn t know how long it s going to take if I can t wait and try for that long then to go find another guy My mind immediately goes to He s only sticking around because he s afraid you ll harm yourself He s using this to start dating other people Once you re better he s gone I ve ruined another relationship How could he do this to me after the hell I ve been through these last 7 weeks Constant thoughts that make me physically ill I have to take my PRN before seeing him because I start shaking getting light headed and having stomach cramps He knows I have BPD but he doesn t understand how intensely I feel the emotions related to every aspect of my life especially our relationship I ve worked so hard these last 7 weeks I m not working so all I do is work on myself in and out of therapy What else does he want from me I don t know what to do We ve both said we wanted to move in together and eventually get married so part of me wants to stick it out but is it really worth making myself even more physically and mentally sick,Suicidal Reference
Bit of a long post apologies in advance I thought I d post this here I m not a regular poster but I do lurk occasionally if something is on my mind A little background I was diagnosed with BPD officially in early 2014 after suddenly attempting suicide by the radial artery Previously I d rejected the thought I was mentally ill beyond being a bit depressed but I was forced to accept this along with a slew of minor mental defections including avoidance intense anxiety and schizotypal behavior I m not normally one to pander to my own misfortunes but I feel as if this information might provide some important context to my issue I m also trying to avoid any emotional instability affecting the writing in this post as I want to be sure this is clear and not influenced by my own feelings I am becoming increasingly disillusioned by my place in life I don t mean that by a what is the meaning of life philosophical way but quite literally I don t even want to do anything with myself anymore I would consider myself high functioning despite the severity of my mental condition while I am no where near to remission I am able to keep a full time career a caring partner even a pet without much issue I persist through the terrors and intense pain of being very mentally ill but I do so with a passionless drive which doesn t reflect my own strength I wake up in the morning with painful dissonance usually the first thing I think about is suicide but the only reason I still come into the office every day is because the anxiety involved to call in sick often or resign would be unbearable for me In fact most of my actions are governed by fear anxiety and a desire to live without pain I m desperate to avoid any struggle that will make things a little worse for me and I feel like I m constantly living my life treading on tip toes careful not wake that tiger in my cage I know if I could I d probably shut all the windows curtains lock the doors and hide in the bedroom for the rest of my life It is common that most days I get back from work and immediately shut myself away in my study from my family and partner preferring the comforting glow of a computer monitor the mental silence and relief of smoking a cone and more recently drinking myself into a quiet state of mind Often I will need to cancel appointments and social events because I am simply too anxious or depressed to do it Some time ago I lived with my sister who is ten years older than me I often would go to her for advice for dealing with mental issues Her and her partner both strongly hold the opinion that you can fix these issues by 1 working hard almost all the time 2 being more social Due to my living arrangements there they put me to work every day and I was strongly discouraged from spending time alone in my room there As I was looking for work they asked that I be maintaining the house and they d often give me heavy gardening work Rain or shine depressed exhausted I did what I agreed to While in the past I might spend 80 of my time at home in my own room I now only woke up and went to bed in it I did my best to entertain their friends with smiles and conversation even though almost all of the time I felt no desire to Often my anxiety was so bad I d pretend I was going out to run exercise simply so I could spend some time at the beach alone with my thoughts at last I did my best but within a couple months I had a psychotic episode went off my medication had several seizures and worst of all was even more depressed than before I m falling further and further away from any desire to improve or work on my issues often the energy to even think about the direction of my life is not within me Without exaggeration at least 90 of my week I feel utterly exhausted everything I do seems to demand more energy than I am able to give I often apologize for my lack of energy as being sick but this is almost constantly present in my daily life apart from having short bursts of energy in mood swings As a result my entirely life has devolved into suffering First my appetite dissolved eating less less frequently I now often force myself to eat so I won t waste away Then came my sex life my own interests hobbies often I try to sleep it all off but I can feel it in my dreams What I m saying is that I feel like even though I deeply care about the people around me I cannot perform the social gymnastics involved with keeping these people in my lives I ve not the energy nor the motivation to maintain some semblance of a normal life in my circumstances I m frustrated because I feel like I m putting up with a life I m not comfortable with I tell myself in the mornings that I need to get up just for one more day but then I realize that this isn t going to end I m going to have to keep playing this game over and over Is it going to be easier to get up in the morning when I m 45 I m sorry but I simply don t think so Things change but they don t change that much I won t be able to live the isolated safe existence I desire and accepting that is hard for me In the end I don t desire death because my partner left me or I lost my job or any physical triggering event I desire it because I constantly feel out of place like I was never really meant to be born I think it s important to make it clear I m not actively suicidal right now the title of the thread pertains to my jaded view on life I feel like I give up on myself a little more every day hours upon hours of depression could certainly do that to you Being BPD meant I ve always hated certain parts of myself and I ve fought hard to destroy those parts of myself but now I resent the husk left in the wake I m becoming increasing concerned that at some point soon I will

tw for passing mentions of self harm and suicide A bit of background I m 21 a trans guy and was diagnosed with BPD at 18 after a string of suicide attempts I m not currently on medication but I m starting DBT in just over a week I also have autism and depression and suspect I might have anxiety who knows I m super nervous posting this because honestly it sounds so silly written down but here goes I have some awful jealousy issues centered around my best friend We ve known each other for a while through school got talking properly three years ago and in the last year or so we ve grown really close This is all good stuff but since we ve gotten so close I ve become extremely possessive of her Example 1 a few months ago she told me she was going to visit a friend for a few days My reaction I had a breakdown that consisted of a two hour long panic attack crying for all I was worth then cutting myself silly because I was convinced that she would either 1 decide she liked this person more than me and then inevitably abandon me or 2 plot with this person to kill me so she doesn t have to deal with me anymore I often have delusions and begin to hallucinate under extreme stress In the end I had to delete her number off my phone remove her from my Skype and get myself two twelve hour shifts at work to stop myself pestering her and ruining her weekend I got into a lot of trouble at work for accomplishing basically nothing instead moping around like my soul had left my freaking body Example 2 we re both gamers and she s really looking forward to this new Blizzard game Overwatch It s not out yet but it s an online multiplayer shooter sort of thing with the beta dropping some time in the autumn Anyway I have nightmares about it most nights I have panic attacks when people mention it I literally sit at my desk and cry until I have nosebleeds or throw up It s gotten to the point that I ve had to install keyword blockers for my browser to stop myself running into the words Overwatch or Blizzard by accident because even seeing those words will set off panic attacks and stress me out to the point I dissociate and start hearing seeing things for days at a time My reasoning I am utterly 100 convinced that she will meet new people through this game like them more than me and ditch me That s literally all it is She insists that she won t but I am very black and white and once I ve formed an opinion it s very difficult to get me change my mind This mindset extends to all other multiplayer games too but for some reason my mind has classed Overwatch as like The Ultimate Evil As you do And then there s a bunch of other things like flying into a panic if she doesn t tell me that she s going out and leaves her Skype signed in so I think she s still there and freak out when I get no reply or feeling personally offended when she says she s going out with her mum for the day or I see her boot up a multiplayer game on Steam And I constantly split on all of her friends instantly hating them if they show any affection towards her which they do of course which just drives the wedge in further I am aware this behaviour must sound absolutely ridiculous I am aware it s bad and I am aware it s hurting her deeply but I can t get a handle on it no matter how hard I try Deep breathing and stuff like taking baths or going for a walk doesn t do anything for me I usually resort to hurting myself because nothing else works She tries to talk me down and tells me she loves me multiple times a day which helps but only minimally I get myself into such a state that trying to get through to me is pretty futile And just This is so silly I love this girl very much and don t want to lose her She has been steadfast for years in saying that she won t leave me she wants to go into mental health has done extensive research and tries her best to understand but I cannot go on treating her like this It s just not fair I am trying my best to be the best friend she deserves but it s just So Hard We ve made small compromises e g she ll give me half an hour s warning before she goes to play a game with another friend but I can t be wrapped up in cotton wool all the time and in general I don t think I m getting any better So can anybody relate Please tell me you relate I couldn t find anything on jealousy this bad What can I do to help this situation I m so sorry for the length I ve needed to get this off my chest for a while edit lmao I tried to edit this post to add flair and my keyword blocker detected Overwatch and wouldn t let me access the page this is so ironic I m going to cry,Suicidal Reference
Long story short I accused a super close friend of mine of doing something she didn t actually do The doubt was just eating at my mind and I couldn t take it anymore she was saying how she doesn t have to prove herself to me but then I threatened to slit my wrists if she didn t and she ended up posting proof This is by far the worst thing I have ever done and I don t think there s anyway I can ask for her forgiveness after she sent me the proof she told me Don t fucking talk to me until im ready to deal with you and I replied with wait why not just deal with it now yes im a cunt and theres literally nothing I can do to get you to forgive me She then said Because im done with you Theres nothing to talk about My mangos manga are waiting and my uterus hurts So leave me alone and finally I told her i should feel sad about that at the same time im glad the doubt isnt eating away at my brain anymore alright i wont blame you if you never wanna talk again im just glad you ended up being right this was all through text by the way So r BPD what the fuck can I even do I just feel fucking horrible for what I did to her shes been with me throughout all this stupid fucking bpd and depression bullshit and this is what I do to her how can I possibly even hope to salvage this shit show,Suicidal Reference

A family member has been long been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder She has extremely low self esteem and thinks she s unattractive and that no one likes her when the major unattractive thing about her is that she doesn t like herself She has churned through a slew of psychologists she starts out liking them but ends up hating them after a few months She doesn t respond well to cognitive behavioral therapy and there are no dialectical behavioral therapists in her area Depression runs in our family and virtually all of the women in one half of our family take antidepressants Anti depressants work very well for her at least for the symptoms of the disorder though she insists they don t work When she s taking anti depressants she doesn t cry uncontrollably or have fits of rage When she takes anti depressants the tone of her voice lifts an octave and she sounds happy When she s off anti depressants the tone of her voice is low depressed and flat affect She has been on and off antidepressants more than a half dozen times in her life Everyone who knows her well can easily tell when she s gone of her medication She insists that anti depressants don t work She gets very angry when anyone suggests otherwise She also says they blunt her sex drive though she isn t dating right now Whenever we raise the issue of antidepressants she lashes out and accuses us of trying to fix her Talking to her about her problems is very difficult because if you do anything other than agree with her assumptions that her life is terrible there s nothing she can do and there is no hope she gets extremely angry and accuses you of not listening When she is on anti depressants she doesn t talk about suicide but she talks about suicide frequently otherwise And she does pose a real risk to herself due to her condition and because she has thought about specific methods What can I do How can I convince her to go back to counseling and to take antidepressants I ve bought and read a book on dialectical behavioral therapy but it hasn t helped me to convince her to take positive steps that would help moderate her powerful emotional swings And I m not a counselor and it s not easy for me to try to succeed in counseling methods when so many psychologists have failed Has anyone here been in a similar state and agreed to be helped What helped you What can I do or say This is very important because we love her and she s in a very dangerous place,Suicidal Reference
I used to think that things would get better as I aged Maybe I d pick up a girlfriend who actually cared about me maybe I d find a hobby that I had a particular interest in or where I excelled Maybe it s the years of substance abuse that have numbed me Maybe it s the years of isolation that have numbed me I don t know anymore I don t have any friends I can t think anymore thoughts have been replaced by this iridescent numbness It feels like neurons are firing in places that they cannot be firing anymore like I ve shut down certain parts of my brain that are essential to everyday life The thing with life now is I ve learned that if I ever find a girl who I truly like and enjoy being with they ll inevitably leave me within 2 weeks Friends who talk behind my back and seem to revel in watching another human being slowly spiral It s sad because as you grow older you grow numb and I think that applies to everyone not just me or us What s sad is that much of the population seems to take some kind of appalling happiness from this it s some weird social caste system derived from the basis of mental illness Life becomes well at least I m not them right I feel like everywhere I go I will be Otherized It feels like my personality does not mesh with the Same Self I cannot be happy in situations where others are absolutely besides themselves and I cannot be happy in my petulant little imaginary box either I m tired all of the time I m sad all of the time and I cannot escape from this neverending feeling of being criticized from a distance as if every imposition I ve placed upon someone is bigger than the burden that I carry due to these continuing impositions that inevitably fail Someone at my old high school killed themselves during the last week of school last year and it was an absolutely appalling event because you could see the discernible change in their sheer reality due to this The guy was lionized and all of my friends who were close to him were sadly lamenting what they could ve done to change the course of events if they ever could ve said anything or sent an extra text that could ve prevented such a mess It s unfortunate that these things to do not illustrate certain lessons in the minds of people Sometimes I feel as though I d be better off as a memory This is mostly bullshit like everything I ve ever said done Wish i had the courage to go through with it but i don t i really don t,Suicidal Reference
I dissociate with daydreams and it happens without even trying In these daydreams it s always will fall back to some sort of pain I felt and what I feel like I should have done Fight back what I should have said what I should I have did etc I ve been trying to control it by not allowing myself to fall into those thoughts because when they do I get upset I ve been noticably happier Constantly reminding myself that these things aren t real that these arguments have not yet happened and that I ll deal with the problems when they re real The day dreams are rather comparable to self harm urges They come and go I was wondering if anyone else had these and had any way to stopping it,Suicidal Reference
My dad doesn t actually love me I understand that now he only cares about the person I pretend to be and the person I really am is too ugly for him to care about Nobody could ever like who I really am I thought that we were close We never were I was stupid I was so fucking stupid for thinking he could ever care about who I really am People are so attached to this fake person but it s not me My dad likes to look at me and pretend that I m just a cheery honors student When I play along and I pretend to be the honors student he loves me Or he thinks he does he loves the idea of the cheery honors student who s always so grateful for his money and turns a blind eye to anything he s doing wrong and never ever cries But the things he sees in me are just an illusion First of all I m not actually smart Almost anyone could have aced the classes I did if they put in the work It was mostly just memorization and occasionally writing papers Most people just aren t going to bother studying for a weekly quiz or locking themselves in for an entire weekend to study for a huge exam Other people had social lives I didn t That made it pretty easy If I had an exam I was worried about I could just study from morning until night for the whole weekend and I d get an A Second I truly don t give a flying fuck about his money if it comes with strings attached I thought he was supporting me through college because he wanted to and it gave him some sort of validation for being a good parent or some shit Yes of course I was fucking grateful I don t want to be in debt for years after graduation But if my tuition is something he s going to dangle over my head he can go fuck himself I don t accept bribes Third I cry All the fucking time Sometimes I still scream Sometimes I scratch myself or burn myself but don t worry only on special occasions Many times I go an entire day and I realize I haven t eaten and I need to force myself to make a bagel and it tastes like chalk dust When I don t see anyone I can go days without showering At one point last year I was so bad that I stopped taking out the trash for several weeks and there were flies all over my apartment and I had to spray Raid all over my kitchen and make a homemade fly trap and after a couple days I got rid of most of them But don t worry daddy you don t have to worry about that I ll just act like your cheery honors student and you can pretend I m not secretly a psycho bitch But see I m not actually a cheery honors student I m a fucked up perfectionist who didn t sleep last night because she was too busy crying and trying to distract herself with various things It s almost 11 AM and I haven t slept But you don t love who I really am Because yes I AM angry and I AM terrified and I AM sad and all of that makes me bad in your eyes I don t want to be this way I ve tried to become someone else I tried really hard to be the cheery honors student But it s not me i can t keep it up it s exhausting Nobody even understands how hard I ve been trying You don t understand My therapist doesn t understand I try to be what you want me to be and i cant do it Sure I can go on meds I can take a pill that makes me act like the cheery honors student all the time you ve made it clear that s the only way you could love me But one day I will forget to take my meds and I will drown in the lake or take a nap on the train tracks or drink bleach or frankly just shoot myself in the face if I had anything approaching courage but I don t Because when I forget to take them I will remember what I am and I will remember that what I am is so disgusting that I will always be hated So I m going to kill myself You can remember me as the wonderful cheery honors student if you want I will die as a nobody because I am a nobody I am lower than a nobody I am dirt I am garbage I am worse than that I am a disgusting parasite What I am inside is too ugly for anyone to ever love You never loved who I am You only loved who I tried to be and pretended to be I tried to be that person but I cant do it anymore I can shut up on the outside and I can stay in my bedroom so you don t have to see me cry But i m still screaming on the inside i never stopped screaming it never really stops i just want someone to look at me and see that i m screaming and still love me nobody ever will i am a parasite and i wasn t meant to be loved you shouldn t have married my mother she was a parasite like me and i never should have been born all i will ever do is cause people pain people that i love i dont want to do that anymore i just want to die,Suicidal Reference
I recently discovered that I have BPD My entire life has wrapped around this unofficial diagnosis so well that I took steps to solving some of my greatest fallbacks before I knew what BPD was I am about to seek professional medical help with this but I havent been able to so far I spent my early life growing up with therapy different diagnosis and so many head pills that it has traumatized me The right thing was never treated because I manipulated the doctors and was not truthful Every time the doctor insisted something against what I had to say I lost trust and respect for them and tried to move on feeling empty and without self identity I felt attacked Growing up I was always the victim but I always denied it This is not my full story so if you doubt me ask and I will tell you exactly why I have come to such a concrete conclusion on this matter My childhood was horrible and when I had the chance I ran I moved to the southern states on an impulse and blew through all my money by the time I got there This is a landmark in my life relevant not because of how my extreme actions were this is not evidence to support my condition Its relevance marks the point in my life where I became an individual I took control and I was actually able to My entire childhood was spent without any control and I mongered for it After living down south for a while with my cousin and living life as a young adult it wasnt quite working out It seemed that no matter how hard I tried I could never make it I felt worthless and I started drinking I was out of my parents house I worked hard Id be damned if I couldnt drink if I wanted to I was arrogant I was overzealous And I realized it I moved back to my parents stayed on their couch for about 6 months I tried to find jobs maybe not as well as I could have however I could not find one Their neighbors were heroine addicts at the time so I dabbled I was never afraid of becoming addicted because of how afraid I was of the drug As much as I do drink or do drugs to ease my pains I have always known when I had to stop No one has ever had to tell me because I was always asking myself Are you forming patterns Cravings Why are you doing this drug I formed a golden rule Never do drugs when you cannot control your mind until you have it under control This rule also implies that one is not depressed in rage manic or anything but clear My emotional pain was always so intense I wanted drugs but by the time I started medicating in my adult life I had already began to unknowingly battle some of the issues I dealt with having BPD I did not know what it was but I knew that my head didnt work quite as everyone elses I noticed my reactions to things when I started taking LSD It made me able to question the things I thought I knew and be honest with myself Again this drug did not allow me to do these things just when I took it As I seldom did but rather introduced me to the strategy It broke through reinforced walls established very early in my life Most recognizably a time when I became a victim of someone elses mental illness This brings me back to the progression of my adult life I sat stagnant for months living with my parents was also a catalyst for the worsening of my symptoms It got to the point again in my life I thought about killing myself I knew it wouldnt fix my problems I didnt really care then but I knew I was blinded by a curtain of liquid emotion spilling like rain falling through the sky It filled every pore in my skin and every vein in my body I knew I had to change things I knew there was something I could do there fucking had to be I was only 19 years old if other people can make it until they naturally die then why cant I even see tomorrow Then I realized My head worked a little bit differently I still didnt know what it was but I knew I began to force my mind to humble itself talk less listen more Think hard and question everything But most importantly be honest with yourself You cant expand when you humor your minds defense mechanisms Now we jump to eight months ago ish I was moved into a new town had a job and things looked alright I was starting to get where I wanted to be I meet a girl and quickly knew I wanted to be together We developed a good relationship and shortly after fell in love Things were great when we were building our relationship Always meeting new people getting a lot of praise and reassurance But after a few months things got hectic I became very anxious and dependant and started exhibiting my most profound symptoms We broke up about three months ago when I became ill I was not considering but wanting to kill myself again I wasnt going to because I knew it wouldnt help me but I wanted it to be able to help me so desperately Life moves on and through trying and talking and loving each other more than we knew we took an objective look at things We loved each other we wanted to be able to work through things and we agreed on what the issues were All we thought they were Time took over and I tried my best and she finally came to visit me We had a rough week I still feel like there was more than my issues that week I feel like there was a lot of defensiveness and resentment Towards the end of the week we were totally unhappy We were considering breaking everything off She didnt want to leave she was angry I didnt actually want her to leave she knew that We talked she told me that she thought I had BPD I didnt know what it was but I didnt deny her I spent the last months teaching myself how to be humble how to listen and think before I judge When i was conscious and clear headed I could do this fairly I hadnt been very good at it but I was able to be just that in this situation I read I searched I analyzed myself I started thinking about my past how things happened and why it happened that way There were a lot of holes I didnt understand why I did things the way I had I looked at my parents my family friends I remembered what was going on It was not easy but I connected a lot of dots I learned how drastically and directly I was effected to some traumatic events I read more and more about BPD and analyzed how the therapist I went to last treated me I thought that he must have known He wouldnt tell me but he was talking to me as if I had BPD I believe he was trying to get me to comfortably rediscover some events in my past before he told me He needed a clearer picture and to preserve trust void of suspicion or interrogation Focusing within and reflecting being honest to myself I have come a long way Im not yet sure where my relationship is going But I know she has been with me as I am trying my best And I have been able to clearly communicate with her I realized the impact this has made on my life and my mind is open I have been spending a lot of time just thinking not doing much I have a job I am able to pay my rent Im getting on my feet We spent time apart and I gained much focus over myself I see myself able to not cycle through my head all day long Another few weeks pass things are growing a little darker for me Its harder to keep my focus with some of the things going on in my life I cant give up I am seeking advice anything anyone has that could help me My mind is open and I am trying to keep it that way Even just someone I can talk to Be objective with and think with,Suicidal Reference
I don t know if you use trigger warnings here I will describe some self harm Background He has been diagnosed with BPD about 3 5 years ago when he was inpatient He does not accept the diagnosis and did not want any treatment since then We ve been together for 5 years ____________________________________ We had dinner at his place There was some leftover pizza I could not eat because I have an anxiety disorder and I can t eat anything left out of the fridge for 4h He had this one and I a new one While we were eating he took a slice from mine cutting with his own knife too fast for me to intervene I did not eat the part his knife touched He noticed and got angry accidentally dropped his knife Then he started punching himself until he fell of the chair unconscious He woke up with a headache and confused asking why there was a slice of my pizza in his plate He is ok now ________________________________ I try everything I can to not make mistakes that set him of This time there were multiple I should have organized dinner earlier and put the old pizza made by his parents in the fridge I should have asked him if he wanted a slice and cut if with my own knife It is really difficult to always say the right thing in the right tone Another time he choked himself until he was unconscious because I had said sorry after he had told me that I was stupid for doing something I don t really know why I am posting this It wasn t something unusual and I know I just have to try to learn and get better at all of this I guess I want to ask What should I do if I can t prevent a situation that I know will make him angry or have to say something that will make him angry Is there any way of preventing the following self harm I am not always that lucky that he forgets why he did it Sometimes it means that he will be suicidal for days Because of a mistake I made I just wished he found another girlfriend I spent so much time trying to make him not hurt kill himself,Suicidal Reference
Hey reddit I m just in desperate need for advice or just really someone to talk to anyone I guess Bit of background on myself I am 22 been coming into self awareness of this condition since I was 15 but due to a abusive and narcissistic mother I was never allowed to seek the help I needed As a result it wasn t until recently that I was officially diagnose My entire life has been nothing but struggle hardship and abandonment Personal relationships have been horrible except for my now husband Now that being said my husband has been the best relationship I have ever had one that hasn t been abusive or based on lies and being used And I am so afraid that I will just push him away because of this condition So afraid he s going to get tired of supporting and taking care of me Now the major problem is in all the years I ve known him we have been a opposite ends of the country We met online on World of Warcraft a few years back and didn t meet until last year We married April of this year and in total we have only spent about 2 months actually physically together which is what I really need to feel happy or at least a little happy in my sea of unstable emotions He is in the Navy and was supposed to get orders to Japan for two years without me but a month ago I was admitted into inpatient hospitalization locked up for wanting to kill myself and self harming This led to me getting in a specific program for military family members that insures orders can be worked around my specific needs my needs being my husband actually with me physically I really have no one else zero friends distant family So his orders for Japan got scrubbed but we have to wait on paperwork and official proceedings to go through before new ones can even be issued and it s the waiting that s killing me I ve already spent so long without him lonely and longing to just be held so I don t feel so terribly empty all the time I know I crave physical affections it s the best thing to make me feel happy and somewhat calm but I m without that completely I don t know how to cope waiting in limbo like this completely alone and secluded I cant even get professional help the soonest I can see a mental health provider is October and my regular doctor flat out refused to treat my BPD and co morbid conditions because they don t feel comfortable dealing with such a complicated condition And the hospital I was in treated me like dirt like a crazy invalid incapable of being able to make any decisions for them self I was even issued by the police a temporary detention order trumped up by the attending doctor s uncaring attitude forcing me to stay longer that I voluntarily agreed on I just dont know what to do anymore this doesn t even cover a fraction of everything I ve gone through To do so would require a written novel and admittance of very unsavory events I feel so exhausted so worn and beaten down It s hard to wake up every day and force myself to keep going especially right now that I am on my own and have my entire life on limbo waiting for people who have never even met me to tell me where I m going in my life with the only person that even cares,Suicidal Reference

I am trying really really hard to make my relationship work My boyfriend has been incredibly patient with me despite the fact that I am a crazy person who can t take any criticism well He still wants to be with me and make this relationship work and I have been trying my best to get my issues under control One of the problems I continuously run into is that I need a lot of support and praise when I mess up and he has no desire to give it For example today I had a freak out because he didn t want to reach out and get a hold of me right away It turned out he had a very good reason for not being able to and once I heard it I felt so stupid that I wanted to die or break up with him I asked him to reassure me me that I am actually getting better because I really need to be reminded that I m making progress Instead he told me that I ask him to tell me that every time I freak out and that he felt it was manipulative I had a panic attack when he said that and now I m sitting at my desk sobbing I want to call him and end the relationship right now which is ridiculous I am an adult and I should be able to handle criticism but all I can think is that I will never be happy that he can t be the partner that I need because I m too high maintenance and that I might as well break up with him because he s going to leave me anyway I feel stupid for wanting validation I have my good days and my bad days with this and today is a really really bad day,Suicidal Reference
Ever feel like when you start hitting bottom you ve shifted into a intense sort of spiritual awakening I felt for a while now that my long term craziness past being major mixed anxiety chemical abuse psychotic depression periods of sadistic self harm was having me cross over into insanity I was recently turning psychotic from taking various medications without any therapy and in result was bringing out a lot of inner demons but it was different this time round because I was directly projecting on my SO whom is the first person I ve ever fallen for I was constantly splitting him making me appear very jekle and hyde in his view I began thinking signs were EVERYWHERE calling out my attention making sure to remind myself that God A Higher Power was NOT in play at least dim down the belief in order too not make myself manically reckless or appear schizophrenic like I did in my teens I started crying naturally for the first time and its IMPOSSIBLE for me to cry rage always blocks it I only do if I am feeling immense guilt or terrified of imminent abandonment even with strangers I m being friendly with but that s only been at my worst of self control I realized feeling everything to be in synchronicity seriously everything was resulting from my subconscious trying to break through I realized I need to start piecing my past together I had a childhood where I was convinced at the young age of four that I was psychotic I started self harming and thinking of death at that age I was really messed up and adult far too early I realized every time I ve suffered terror from intense depersonalization and derealization simultaneously occurring that I have been missing a lot of parts of myself needing too integrate those missing pieces in order for me to grow I am also starting too realize a lot about my cognitive functioning when dealing with relationship stress why I did things that I had done in my childhood and in my present past I basically am a product of a highly fragmented childhood but I feel I have hope due too realizing my reality I am hopeful the mental craze could potentially change into something for the best as in an awakening Turning to mental health professionals was a disastrous experience as they only wanted too force the offer of drugs getting emotionally unsettled had to restrain my own self from attacking the psychologist at the ward by their offensive responses due too major stigma leaving a bitter taste for them and me but in a sense the ordeal pushed me further into waking up when having to face it all alone and unheard Can anyone understand where I am coming from,Suicidal Reference
I ve built my entire emotional stability around one person and that person isn t dependable or responsible it seems that every major breakdown I ve had over the last few years has been related to them in one way or another Both stints in hospital have been about them My suicide attempts have been related to them In June I saw them for the first time in a year and a half and slept with them It wasn t planned at all and I was kind of surprised because they know everything but I thought that maybe it was going to be okay And since then there s been lots of nudes and flirting and we had Skype sex the other night and just saying to each other how we want to see each other in person etc etc And I know that it s partially emotional prostitution on my side I give him the sex and whatever and in exchange I get to feel wanted and important I ve struggled with friendships and relationships my entire life people will use me for what they want and then leave without any warning and he is the only person in my entire life that has ever even made me feel worth something even though I know I m not And when I m with him I feel calm and normal He lives 2 hours away at the moment and it s just a bit expensive for me to get there and back so I ve been trying to figure out a day that I can go there or he can come here and spend the night And just tonight he s stopped responding to my messages even though he s reading them and I m panicking so badly I don t know if I m overreacting but I ve been down this path before with him and it s destroyed me already I would rather cut out my own heart than cut him out of my life please don t suggest that They know everything so trying to talk with him isn t going to create any results and might make things worse I don t want to be the crazy girl sending a billion messages when he isn t replying I just know that I m worthless and hopeless and that I can feel the end for me coming closer I don t know if this particular instance will work out I know that even if it does this won t be the last time I have to deal with this I ve known that this had an expiry date all along I know how to do it properly this time I m just really scared and I want it all to be okay,Suicidal Reference

I ve struggled with MDD since I was a young teen I ve received the diagnosis of BPD though I really don t agree with it I feel like the aspects of BPD that apply to me are a result of depression Things like self harm talk of suicide past attempts low self esteem feeling hopeless I m rarely in any kind of relationship to have it be unstable and my relationships with others are pretty much all superficial anyway I don t have huge emotional ups and downs downs and further downs maybe but not ups Anyway I m just wondering if others who have been diagnosed with BPD feel that it can be a result of other mental illness not necessarily a separate disorder Like I have low self esteem because I have depression and I self harm because I have low self esteem and I think of suicide because of the depression etc I feel like my doctor who has worked with me for 5 years is giving up on me because of the diagnosis and it makes me feel even worse than the depression already had,Suicidal Reference
I love her deeply and have been with her for five years We have had arguments and fights almost all ending with her running off screaming in tears We then talk about it and resolve issues The principle thing that comes up time and again is her feeling she cannot communicate well with me that she talks too much and she should just shut down around me When I hear all this my heart breaks and I reassure her that she does not and she doesn t need to respectively Today she had a super rough day learning some bad academic news but we talked it through and she relaxed around me We got into a discussion I love talking with her and seeing her often different point of view with regard to many things The conversation meandered and we starting talking about tangential points and this led to her screaming and crying and begging to be let out of the car Of course I obliged and she went off I don t know what else I am supposed to do in this situation and am currently stressed that 1 she left 2 she will not answer her messages 3 she does this more and more frequently 4 she talks of suicide almost casually 5 she feels so terrible and that I am responsible for it 6 she will feel this way forever I am probably doing something wrong I listen to her I try to reason out her views but if they do not merge with mine am I meant to just shut up and let her views build She takes small problems and combines them and creates a wall that she cannot get over She breaks down and I m supposed to just hold her and empathise and I can t help but feel were missing something that can aid the situation Typing this I feel defensive I am reaching out to you guys but maybe I shouldn t even say something to anyone else This is her thing and she carves privacy above all else It s why I can t talk to our friends about this They don t know about the BPD and she always acts so well in front of the She saves that true emotion for just us I appreciate that and her honesty but I a thinking it might be time she gets therapy from a professional I just needed to vent I think Thanks for being a soundboard,Suicidal Reference
Me 19F was informally diagnosed with BPD at the age of 16 since according to the DSM BPD can not be diagnosed if the patient is under 18 I have tried to explain the illness to my boyfriend 24M of 5 months who lives with me a few times when relevant The problem is he doesn t seem to get it or understand that it is a part of me so to speak not a way I chose to me It s very hard to get my feelings thoughts through to him when he doesn t have an empathetic bone in his body The discussions usually leave me in tears or furious because I feel like he doesn t care about me and doesn t want to understand or I feel crazy I am constantly bombarded with what s wrong s and just talk to me Even though I have explained before that a lot of times I don t even understand what s wrong let alone able to verbalize it to someone who doesn t have a mental illness The struggle of self harm is also a topic that seems to be out of his grasp of comprehension He finally seems to understand that it is not an attention seeking type behavior or an attempt to guilt people but still gets aggressive in tone if I try to communicate I m having an urge I want him to understand but also don t want him to think I m crazy I ve also been accused of being too clingy and paranoid jealous I ve tried to explain my attempts to keep my relationships with SOs healthy and not define the person I am but that it is a struggle On the flip side I go through days or weeks where I m too distant and shut down and don t show affection I guess I m looking for advice on how to explain BPD to someone who hasn t heard anything about it without freaking them out Also any suggestions about maintaining a healthy relationship and boundaries when you have BPD would be greatly appreciated,Suicidal Reference
A few times I remember something like this Being in the emergency room because family wanted me hospitalized telling them No I do not want to harm myself I don t want to kill myself And them writing down the opposite Another time IN the psychiatric hospital I always said normal healthy things because I wanted to get out Frankly the doctor rarely asked questions Or gave a shit But APPARENTLY he wrote down that I was still very suicidal and often expressed desire to hurt myself I never said anything like that So I had to stay longer because he wrote down things I never said Sure in other situations I definitely DID show lots of signs of wanting to hurt myself and actually doing it But those times it feels like they just lied Anyone else ever have moments like that Where no one believes you because a doctor wrote down otherwise You question whether or not you simply don t remember properly It s scary Everyone thinks you re 100 insane and talks to you as if you re an idiot and completely out of it,Suicidal Reference
Diagnosed almost three years ago after a stay in a stress center self admitted with the encouragement of my sister after threatening several times to commit suicide Current medications are Busiprone Lamictal and Ativan but only as needed My boyfriend and I have been dating for roughly a year Backstory I say roughly because when we first went out everything was supposed to be casual because he had been upfront with me about not being over his ex About 7 months ago the thing I feared most happened He broke up with me said it wasn t fair for him to date me when he still felt like he had unresolved feelings for his ex They ended up hanging out or getting back together for about 2 weeks before he came back to me and told me that he felt he had gotten closure and he was absolutely sure he had no romantic feelings for her anymore and that he wanted to focus on building a real relationship with me We got back together and have been together ever since The biggest challenges for me have been 1 Getting over the fact that he abandoned or rejected me for her 2 His schedule is extremely taxing and during the school year I only get to see him one day a week and during the weekend it seems like I get separation anxiety from this And 3 anytime his schedule changes or I don t get to see him as much as I d like and anytime he s too tired or stressed to have sex I take the rejection VERY personally often getting extremely sad or angry and consequently lashing out sometimes by saying things I deeply regret later The positives and the reason I believe that this is a healthier relationship than any of my past ones have been that we communicate fairly well Even if there is an argument or an emotional outburst we always talk it through and find a resolution We both listen and we both talk I am learning to balance this relationship with my life trying not to neglect my own needs and realizing that I don t have to be with him every second of every day and that is getting better He s extremely understanding and when we do have a fight or when I lash out at least when I apologize or explain he is ready to move on and forgive forget even though I can t always let it go He clearly cares for me very much and I believe him when he says he is 100 in our relationship and that he has no feelings for his ex In fact my perspective on what happened is that it was better for him to break up with me and figure out what he really wanted as opposed to him staying with me and me never really knowing if he was truly done with that relationship I m still struggling a lot though with the fallout surrounding the ex and his schedule I m trying to figure out how to deal with his time constraints in a healthy way and to not get mad or hurt if there is a change or when he doesn t have as much time for me as I would like The other big thing is that he has expressed an interest in maintaining a friendship with his ex AND she happens to work at the dentist office he goes to I get incredibly jealous and insecure about anything that has to do with her Regardless of the fact that I trust him the whole situation makes me extremely uneasy and leads to a lot of anxious internal dialogue What if he leaves me again Why wasn t good enough to keep him from leaving in the first place What made her so much better than me I ll never be as pretty or as good as her I m too much trouble and she was probably so easy to deal with in comparison Will he ever love me the way he loved her If he really cared about me why can t he just cut her out of his life Same thing when it comes to his schedule Why doesn t he want to spend more time with me Why doesn t it matter to him if he sees me or not Why doesn t he want to see me all the time He doesn t care about me I m too needy I m aware that all of this is going on inside my head and has to be dealt with but sometimes it comes in such a flurry of emotion or anxiety it seems like I can t stop it from happening or even interrupt the negative self talk Just looking for any thoughts suggestions that might help me continue to work through some of the anxiety,Suicidal Reference
Hey everyone I forgot to post that this might be triggering in the title so please be aware that there could be triggers in this post I was married on Friday to a wonderful man It was a beautiful ceremony with many friends while on a retreat in the woods out in the country On Saturday we left the retreat to go into town and get some things from the store On the way there we began to argue about missing a community dinner at the retreat and before I knew it I had disassociated and was no longer in control of myself He threw a drink on me and I hit him The day after we were married I can hardly believe what s happening and I don t know what to do I ve had my diagnosis a bit over a year and I m currently on 75mg of Wellbutrin to counter depression and help to keep me level Until now it s worked wonderfully I have gotten through the initial shock and suicidal thoughts and now we re home and I ve had a good night s sleep though we had another argument this one a simple misunderstanding as soon as we got home to unpack the car I m obviously not okay with any of this And I m obviously not feeling really good about myself Mostly though I m scared It s really scary to think about not being in control of myself or able to stop myself from acting like this I m scared of losing him he s known about the diagnosis and is willing to continue working on things so far but I also wonder if he d be better off without me Everything is jumbled and I came here just to see if anyone can relate or have any thoughts of help and support Please don t flame me for my behavior I know it was out of line and you couldn t say anything to make me feel worse about it I just want help,Suicidal Reference

I was diagnosed with bpd this past winter I feel like I ve known for years but refused to accept it It s not an easy disorder to fix It was recommended to do DBT I don t see what would be the benefit Instead I go to counseling twice a month and visit my psychiatrist once a month to adjust medicine I d prefer to see my counselor weekly but I just can t afford it and my insurance refuses to cover more than one a month Nonetheless counseling seems to help me keep calm My antidepressants seems to keep me from crying all day But that s where it stops I m feeling like there s too much to heal from There s been too many horrible memories made and no where near enough wonderful memories to counteract I was sexual abused by my father emotionally abused by my mother and physically abused by my brother I married young My husband is abusive in multiple ways He has something wrong with him I just know it But he s refusing treatment Anyway that s all old news Removed details of why this year has been absolute hell the worst year out of my 25 years I ve gotten too many people into reddit and I don t want them to find me I take his abuse because I have no one else I am alone I HATE being alone My thoughts are cruel I m not afraid I m going to hurt myself I couldn t hurt the people that supposedly love me I m afraid someone is going to hurt me I don t know what to do I m so tired I m tired of being a burden I m tired of remembering I m tired of distractions just to get through the day I m tired of pretending to be okay just to not upset anyone I m tired of being the kind of person that hurts others with words and actions whenever I m being myself and not controlling my emotions I m tired of being tired I want to run away But I don t want to scare anyone I wish I could do what Hermione did make her family forget all about her It was hard for her but it didn t hurt her family I want to run away and see the world and all the dangerous things I want to be covered in tattoos and have bright blue hair I don t want to be who people need me to be But I have no choice I don t remember where I was going with this,Suicidal Reference

The person who mainly raised me died recently the next one probably will soon too One of my biological parents is battling cancer probably quite unlikely to live for much longer too they have been trying to protect me by not telling me but I found out tonight I left my native country some time ago anyway and see no future for me in returning to that country at least for 5 10 more years or until some drastic societal and technological changes I am trying to build my life here practically and emotionally I have great friends for support but there are times like this night when none is available and I am scared and hate myself for not being able to be there for my family I have always held it natural that old people die and that there are many extents of suffering that are worse than death and I haven t even been really sad about them am I a bad person for that it s just my selfish fears and not so selfish fears for my younger sibling Because I am 24 and have come a long way about it recently but many of my life skills are still basically non existent at the level of a pre teen I do sometimes wish I could die instead of them I spent so much time being suicidal and I am still alive and in quite good health it doesn t seem fair that so many people who want to live have to die sooner that they d like to,Suicidal Reference

I was running an errand today which was to just drop a package off for an overseas friend There was a lady talking to a postal worker blocking the bin where I could easily throw my package in and leave They were blocking it but if I had been given just 3 seconds I could ve squeezed right by real quick and thrown my package in the bin Unluckily the lady talking to the postal guy turned around to leave as I was trying to squeeze by so she almost ran into me In a rude tone she said excuse me and she rolled her eyes stepping back as if I was the one being so rude on purpose As she said excuse me I said sorry Obviously my apology wasn t enough not that she deserved one Then to escalate it further I dropped my package off in the bin and turned to leave but the lady was walking so slowly her stupid heels that we both exited out two different doors and she stepped back again saying You can go first You seem to be in a rush with the most passive aggressive tone At first I just paused and stood there shocked at how she was treating me wanting to do something about it but I couldn t say anything I wanted to curse her out so badly I wanted to stick up my middle finger and tell her that yeah I m in a rush to commit suicide Fuck off please When I come across situations like this I can t think fast enough to say things back at these rude strangers I freeze or panic and angry tears start to build up but I don t actually cry Then I unleash all my anger afterwards by slamming doors or driving aggressively I hate myself for just letting them walk away without me saying anything back When situations like these happen that catch me off guard I panic I hate being this emotional and sensitive I don t know how to be better prepared for things like this I know I sound like a wuss I d also like to make a note that I m an Asian American and I ve been raised to keep my mouth shut and be extra polite to people especially strangers It feels a bit unfair because it allows anyone to take advantage of me easily I m totally not an Alpha person and it sucks,Suicidal Reference
I could really use some help from people who know how hard it is to be abandoned After many years of friendship Patrick fell out of my life He meant the world to me he was there soft and sweet and always warm in a world where I found very little love However relating to turmoil in his relationship with his on off girlfriend for reasons still unknown to me he severed the friendship last December I hurt I cried I was confused and I persevered and moved forward The last thing I told him was that if he were to get his senses back I would be here Last Monday Patrick came back He told me of his looming thoughts of death how his girlfriend left him how if he were to say one last thing it would be to tell me he s sorry It felt like the most beautiful knife as I really never thought he d be back How do you forgive someone for throwing you away His anorexia puts him so close to death and I love him so deeply my beautiful unlovable Patrick Any input advice or opinions would be appreciated I meet with him next Monday and he promises to tell me what really happened I want him back but I struggle still with boundaries and slowly letting someone gain trust as opposed to throwing my trust at them,Suicidal Reference
And that s the illness I m calling horrible lying and manipulative not the sufferers Not been doing brilliantly for a while now been out of it dissociating a lot ignoring people and generally trying to avoid my own head Last night got a bit drunk got a rush of elation and lay in bed next to my SO proclaiming One day I m going to get happy drunk and take a bunch of pills and then I ll die and I won t have to be sad any more Then I burst into tears Suicide isn t something I ve been thinking about minus the constant ideation for a while It just came out while I was drunk And it s a little worrying to think that s how I think underneath I drove a fair distance today and burst into tears in the car All I could think about was how awful this is how it s not really having a life just spending your days distracting yourself from your own mind and how I just want it all to stop Of course the crying didn t last long Now I feel shaky and sick but I know I could just as easily feel fine and not remember anything My psych review is next month and I want them to be open and honest with me and actually validate my disorder s by giving me a diagnosis but I m also afraid that I ll just be fine in the office and they ll never know how I do on a day to day basis because I forget BPD lies to you and makes everyone including you think you re fine all the time when you re not It manipulates you and makes you act differently all the time but it doesn t let you remember your own emotions It s really fucking hard,Suicidal Reference

I barely even know where to start but I ll try and keep this short I lost my job last year because I was physically ill I was actually pretty mentally unwell at that time too but managing to go into work albeit spending the day fantasising about hurting myself to pass the time I ended up moving back home which is in the East I had been working in London before that a few months ago because I didn t have money as I wasn t working and wasn t well enough to go back to work mentally or physically My mental health went into a really big decline around March and I ended up attempting suicide several times When I got back I spent the whole summer searching for jobs and managed to find one I really loved the sound of and was so flattered when they offered it to me It pays well and I am really excited for this opportunity I am supposed to start in less than two weeks The job is in yet another city so I have been preparing myself for the move and focusing on that So what s the problem Well obviously as usual the problem is me I ve been telling everybody around me that I m feeling pretty OK but honestly I m not I ve been lying to myself I ve been attempting to keep a relatively serene superficial surface but inside of me the hurricanes of emotion have been stirring more violently than ever Just yesterday a friend said something to me along the lines of eventually the people around you will feel unappreciated and give up You have to realise that it s hard for people to understand what it s like to feel like you do when they aren t in the same situation and by no means is that their fault Obviously I can t read this in any other way than that I m a terrible person who drives everybody away from me and this stings in my stomach every second I think of it because I feel like a failure in my relationships This morning I had a huge fight with my mom and ended up screaming at her how much I want to kill myself which is totally futile never mind embarrassing because I don t share much with her to do with my mental health she doesn t even know I have a BPD diagnosis The only thing she says is she thinks I m not ready to move to another city and start a demanding job if I m feeling like this I honestly don t know what to do I feel hurt bereft embarrassed useless and frankly semi suicidal I feel trapped and ridiculous and above all of this I am totally totally exhausted and so frustrated that my struggle with BPD is jeopardising my opportunities in life Who am I supposed to be if I can t even function normally and earn myself a living Should I go and do this job and try to be normal I just don t have a clue and I feel like absolutely nobody is listening to me no matter how loud I shout The only person who takes me remotely seriously is my boyfriend but he is so busy with work at the moment and because we don t live close anymore I don t get the chance to talk to him as much as I would like I am so so tired of this I just can t see any way out of anything except the permanent one,Suicidal Reference

so this is kinda about sex so you might not want any details but since you clicked on it consider yourself warned so the deal is I am not sure I like emotional sex at all it s more of a necessity something your body demands when you are in love but it hurts I keep having urges to have affairs with taken men who I find reasonably attractive and have some chemistry with but whom I know to be safe both not to fall in love with me and not have me fall in love with them does anybody else have such socially disapproved fuckbuddy urges does this go away with therapy anybody figured out what this symptom represents thanks,Emotional Distress

I was diagnosed with bpd 7 years ago during a hospitalization I am also diagnosed and take medication for bipolar disorder I have been mostly stable for years aka I have held the same job and am in a serious years long relationship and have not been hospitalized since my initial diagnosis I fit every symptom of bpd but my parents are both in criminal justice professions and have told me repeatedly that I do not have bpd because I am stable not a criminal or child beater I don t have kids and i also received therapy for my traumas that caused it due to my stability they think bipolar covers everything that I dealt with as a younger person and blame their own genes as at least 2 living women on each side of the family are openly bipolar however I was sexually assaulted as a younger woman and grew up in a somewhat empty environment because my brother was seriously ill for years and I was ignored both of which I believe caused the bpd I do not treat my bpd at all besides seeing a shrink 3x a year and practicing mindfulness due to my parents beliefs and my own lack of treatment of bpd I have convinced myself on more than one occasion that it is a crap diagnosis I doubt it even though i was diagnosed during a month in the hospital and fitting the textbook definition it s self defeating and awful I know but it just seems easier to do nothing I think this prevents me from seeking treatment or dbt especially when combined with the comfort of stability basically does anyone get this do you ever think you re too good for this diagnosis how do you overcome the stereotypes what have you done to recover,Emotional Distress
I feel so pathetic as a 22 year old who cannot drive When I was on my Ls I was either constantly panicked because I was not in control of the other cars fearing they would just run into me at any time OR I was completely faded out and dead to the world which resulted in me running red lights and almost hitting a kid without even noticing that was when I stopped trying Even in the passenger seat I ve been trying to train myself and stay mindful but I still panic that people will run into me or just day dream Pretty similar reasons that I cannot hold a job my fight or flight response is triggered constantly and it s so intense How are you I either get super defensive and attack the person for asking me or I just give up and walk out because that question is too hard to answer Stupid things like that just set me off I ve gotten better at waiting before acting on these impulses as the panic only lasts 5 20 minutes for small things like that but people start to think I m insane or I never get my job done because I m constantly trying to calm down Every DBT group I ve been to the BPDs there are working and driving around Yes they re struggling in different areas But I feel so broken So different and like I don t belong there Am I alone in this,Emotional Distress
Hello I m new here and recently diagnosed with BPD I ve always had a lot of difficulty with interpersonal relationships and being acutely sensitive to people s moods but I never thought I had a problem until this past year I started dating my boyfriend and about a month into the relationship I started going absolutely crazy with wondering when he was going to leave me or get tired of me I ve had this problem before resulting in two divorces but this was the first time I was forced to confront the fact that I may not be mentally well I started working on getting help and that s how I got my diagnosis I wouldn t say I m relieved to be diagnosed but in a way I am I can t tell you how many times people have asked me what is wrong with me only to have me answer I don t know Now I at least have an answer Suddenly I m starting to make sense to myself I have a really long way to go but I am trying to be better I m really grateful that spaces like this exist,Emotional Distress

It s been the most prevalent thing in any relationship romantic or platonic I never feel comfortable until I know what it is someone wants from me Once I know I go to great lengths to provide it But until I know who I m supposed to be for them I m anxious and worried and stressed about the relationship In order to interact I just have to know who I m supposed to be for them I feel like a lot of times this supplements having to have a personality As long as people give me the appropriate box to fit into I m okay I can be anything they need me to be as long as I know what it is But fuck do I hate not knowing who I m supposed to be for them Especially in romantic relationships Until I figure out what persona I m filling I can t ever relax or feel comfortable I know I should be myself but I also don t want to ruin things before I can actually be myself Idk I m just venting but I hate the weird limbo of not knowing what role I m supposed to be playing with people,Emotional Distress
My girlfriend of almost 3 years just broke up with me Said she needed to learn how to value herself and figure out who she is That s fine and dandy The break up I can handle It s the complete lack of sympathy and caring after the break up that bothers me I am completely fine being friends I don t need to talk to her every single day or see her ever The fact is she s going around telling everyone I m emotionally abusive and manipulative and that s what is really bothering me She knew I had BPD and I was struggling with it a lot She said she cared about me and while she didn t quite understand BPD she tried really hard to understand that I am the way I am because of it After hearing all these things she s been saying I m just hurt and it s so incredibly invalidating to all of the work I ve put in over the last 5 years since I ve been diagnosed I know I ve come such a long way and that I m incredibly self aware and very good at handling my BPD at this point but all those things made me second guess all of my progress I don t understand how your best friend can turn their back on you and then put you down like that Now she s ignoring me and acting like I m the worst person in the world and all I want is to have a friend that understands me and won t give up on me I m sick of being hurt this way,Emotional Distress

I was walking to a corner store today and a man stops his car and tells me that he thinks I m beautiful Fine Whatever at this point I m used to one or two men catcalling or things like that I m a little bothered but the guy drives away and I continue my walk After about three minutes the same guy pulls over again and asks my age and if I d like to hang out with him I say no he drives away At this point I m shaken up and worried about him driving by again so I text my friend who lives nearby just in case I keep walking and I m about a block away when a guy on his bike passes me He stops and asks how I am I say fine and he continues in the opposite direction At this point I m panicking so I call my dad and ask if he can pick me up in the store While I m on the phone with my father the guy on a bike comes back and asks if I d like to go give him a show I say no He leaves I finally make it to the store and I m shaking so much I just want to go home and never leave I buy some stuff and my dad picks me up and I get home safe But I still can t shake this dumb feeling that I m being stalked or watched and I haven t come out of my room since I m upset at myself for being so freaked out about this but I just can t calm down,Emotional Distress
Hey guys I love this place I love the support I ve received here However a couple recent posts were the last straw for me in a string of frankly disgusting posts One was by a red pill guy wondering how to best maniupulate a girl with BPD which was later removed but was still unbelievable to me And on another of them about someone s ex wife I saw a lot of you say that this wasn t the place for him to post and the moderator Rain disagreed and encouraged him seeking support That s fine if that s how she wants to run this sub and I have no anger towards her But I d like a support group that feels safe a support group where I don t feel like I m just as likely to discover someone attacking me my disorder as I am to find help I ve started r BPDsupport as a subreddit for exclusively those who have been diagnosed with BPD Come join me over there and even if you aren t bothered by friends family posts the two subreddits are not mutually exclusive,Emotional Distress

Without going into a huge backstory for brevity s sake I ve been having a really difficult time the last few days stemming from the end of a very important relationship friendship I have an abnormally good memory it can be argued that I have hyperthymesia though I realistically probably just have an exceptionally good precise memory and therefore my brain constantly attacks me with memories sometimes to the point where I have to physically shake my head and exclaim Stop This has been happening a lot the last few days and as a result I feel like hiding and completely disappearing from everyone I feel that way quite often actually which I find odd given my BPD diagnosis which I only received recently mind you I can t even really explain a reason why I want to disappear I never have a real reason for feeling this way It just always feels like a good idea to hide in my house never go outside and essentially become Boo Radley Is this a common thing that comes with BPD Or is this possibly coming from my depression dysthymia instead,Emotional Distress

So just recently I had a very good friend pass away he was older around my dad s age but we were very close and actually was more of a father figure than my own ever was to me Sadly I was the last person to speak to him before he passed away in his sleep it was ruled a heart attack sadly that night I went over and talked to him he had taken a pain med he had a work related injury as he was in pain He got a methadone pill from a coworker as he told me this I became angry with him being a former addict I knew it was strong for someone that didn t take pain meds often and it isn t even really used to control pain but help with withdrawal He was very incoherent but I had seen him like this when he had his knee operated on due to the work injury we was a lightweight with pain meds Well he was fading in and out on me and ended up falling asleep on the couch so I stayed for a bit as I was using his wifi on my laptop and I finished up turned the lights off and let him sleep That is the last time I saw him as he was cremated today was his funeral services Throughout all of this happening the medicine I am on which is Seroquel XR I have had to up the dose to help keep myself sane well I was doing it a lot my doctor had me at such a low dose it wasn t doing anything I called and requested an earlier appointment with my doc due to the situation but today realized I would be out of meds tomorrow and I don t have an appointment until the 20th where she could stock me back up on samples I called today asking if I could get in sooner as I deemed this an emergency visit or at least come in to get more samples no go I have to see the doc and the soonest that would be is on the 20th so I m looking to be going 14 days w o medicine I got angry but not with the secretary on the phone and simply said please cancel all future appointments as I will just be going to the hospital even though I don t want to I feel it is my only option to ensure I stay level Just for a FYI she had me on 25mg Seroquel XR once a day that meant breaking a 50mg XR tablet in half and I was taking 200mg to stay sane I don t get why she put me on such a low dose as she had me on this med before but it was at 150mg I have had some rough spots where I lost control and could do nothing but cry for my friend he was my only friend he accepted everything about me including my mental issues and I have been blaming myself for not doing something that night knowing that what he took was way too powerful and with him having heart conditions already that it was way too risky being a former pain killer addict I knew all of the signs to watch out for and it seemed like I ignored them and most of all I hate myself because I left his house angry with him I know none of this is my fault and there was nothing I could really have done but he just meant so much to me and the loss hurts like hell and now I m dealing with my doctor not cooperating with me during this very rough time I don t want to go off of meds as I feel that they are working at least at the doses I have been taking and I m scared I m going to loose control after I take my remaining medication tomorrow I m scared I m sad I m angry and I do not know what to do Edit changes,Emotional Distress

I had a lot of bad things happen to me this past years that made me hide my true identity All of them leading up to the breakup with my boyfriend about 6 months ago I ve had frequent major episodes of dissociation to keep my self from coming out I ve been splitting between being completely different persons in different situations But finally after much reading on bpd and going back in my diary and memory my brain kind of shut down completely When i came back everything fell in it s place I remembered who I actually am and suddenly that foggy unreal feeling just disappeared The thing is 3 years ago I was diagnosed with Asperger sydndrome But I have been trying to act like a neurotypical person all my adult life just to fit in I have rejected all the lone time I need I ve been forcing myself to talk more than I really am capable of I have been hiding away all my few true interests and cultivated a wide range of activities just so I wouldn t seem so boring I kind of became my ex The good part is that most of the time my BPD syptomes are absent But the sad part is I have come to the realization that i will have a hard time being around my friends It would take lots of energy to switch to neurotypical thinking and back again I would have to the person they have come to know is a complete opposite of who I really am I kind of built my whole life around this persona and it is kind of sad to know that nothing will be like it was before A big hole has been created around me instead of in me and I now have to fill it with something that is meaningful to the real me Somehow i think I may have cured myself But I m really ambivalent to the greatness this change,Emotional Distress

I ve been reading through so many post on this forum and others about BPD I had started therapy and got diagnosed I stopped because of my own compulsions and worries I have ruined my relationship because of my lies and my instability I feel like such a shitty person Why am I so horrible How will anyone ever love me again Will he ever forgive me for all the shit I put him through I don t know what to do with myself I m such a wreck right now and I keep fucking everything up even if I don t want to,Emotional Distress
I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder last year but it was never much of a problem but started getting so intense last month It s constant I try every day to do anything to make it easier to leave the house i shower and dress nice and charge my phone and get my purse ready and know all the shortcuts to avoid people But it never works I try so hard but it s just not working I ve been trying the just force yourself thing but nothing and it s getting to a point where it s so bad I can only eat around twice a week I never have enough energy to study or work If I can find a psychiatrist is this enough to be able to ask for medication Will the psych think im overreacting and tell me to try harder Has anxiety medication worked at all for you How about if you have substance problems and dont wanna give up your weed and alcohol,Emotional Distress

I never have been able to find very clear information about the link between sex and BPD There is a lot of loose information floating around on those with BPD possibly being impulsive and or reckless regarding sex I also noticed it is common that some people describing those with BPD as lustful wild and very attractive That is about it I feel like there is SO much more though BPD is a Ä surprise a PERSONALITY disorder It has to be strongly connected to our sexuality right At least for me I feel like having BPD and my sexuality is VERY connected Maybe too connected When I was diagnosed with BPD 2 years ago I have been reflecting back on my sexuality since I can see how some traits of mine connected others I m not to sure There could be another underlying factor at play for myself but I really want to hear what others say Maybe we have some things in common maybe I am just a sexual deviant Maybe you will or have seen certain patterns of your own that may be tied to having BPD Some of these things I m not even sure if they are good or bad My pattern is trying to use sex to cope with emotions A more healthy way of dealing with them I m not sure what kind of guidance I m looking for or even if I m looking for any I hope to get more knowledge of the topic though ANYWAYS let me give you a few of my own examples that MAY or MAY NOT be connected to BPD I tried to explain a little bit Some of them might be me just being a complex human being with my own personal desires and views beliefs Strong sexual imaginary even at odd inappropriate times and getting deeply lost in them I use it for a coping method when I feel my emotions about to boil over Also to experience a positive strong emotion bring me back after dissociation An example is having a sexual day dream before a stressful situation ÄúRandomly Äù really wanting NEEDING sex and to feel good from it possibly caused by a trigger needing closeness needing to feel something strong and positive escape what hurts needing a big emotional release Getting extra upset from a sexual disappointment Maybe normal but sometimes I come to tears Suddenly getting turned off for Äúno reason Äù during sex solo and getting upset about it A rapid switch of emotion almost possible trigger Falling asleep to strong sexual thoughts to keep emotions in track I get upset at night way too often Fantasize about the same sex and still not 100 why AM I BI AM I GAY MAYBE I JUST THINK THEY ARE PRETTY You know Ä Identity probs Possibly increase or sudden desires to do Ä um Äúsolo work Äù quick little alone time makes less of negative emotions Getting love and lust confused often and forever Thinking the grass might be greener with another partner Over the top fantasy of things things you sorta regret and would never act out Or just Äúnot normal Äù fantasy in general Dissociation and or cry during sex Questioning monogamy more people to love me Yay Ä Desiring INTENSIVTY in sex Sex being more for the thrill than the connection although connection is NOT completely ignored Having urges to do things you would regret to get a Äúfix Äù Must I explain Thinking of possibly being a sex addict without actually being one A fetish for helplessness A feeling I m VERY use to while suffering with BPD so I believe I like to twist it into a positive thing Being part of BDSM lifestyle as a submissive Obviously trying to make codependency an Äúokay Äù and expected thing Loving the idea that someone will always take care of me Feeling that sex is tied to who I am more than it probably is Others would describe you as pretty wild or they would if they knew Sexuality is ranked probably a bit too high in your life Please send me any articles your own examples ideas thoughts and or theories Feel free to say something of mine isn t connected to BPD As I said there is little good information on the topic so I feel like this is up in the air P S It is important to remember that sexuality is very complex and personalized when commenting TLTR Do you think sexuality is connected to BPD How does BPD affect your sexuality Comment with thoughts examples theories and or links to information Edit Thank you everyone for opening up and also accepting me when I did You all have been very thoughtful and I appreciate the details Please feel free to continue to share It seems to help us understand the bigger picture and show that we aren t alone There are even more things that I can relate to that those had posted that I haven t really thought about I ve also thought about more of my examples how connected sex and BPD is a bit too close to comfort in my eyes There can be some fun benefits though I do feel a bit more enlightened to decode myself even a tiny bit more Thanks to you I am also still looking for any articles research books on the topic If anyone has any suggestions or can share something informative it would be great It truly seems the information on sex and BPD hasn t been researched well Yet sex can be a symptom of BPD Impulsive behavior and BPD is very diverse between individuals So is sex,Emotional Distress
So I write quotes sometimes take something already written and modify it to fit me in a way to help me stay positive this is a first this one is modified but it is very dark it was very simply edited as well so I don t want to take credit for it at all So when I manage to sleep I sleep I don t dream no night terrors etc I m pretty safe in that department my MIs including BPD which I believe is the main one that shows all show in me during the day while I m awake I was on Facebook and came across the legend of The Russian Sleep Experiment and at the very end that is what I took down and edited how I see what I made it into is what my MIs are to me it is as follows What am I WHAT AM I Have you forgotten so easily I am you I am the madness that lurks within you begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind I am what you hide from in your bed every night I am what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where I cannot tread,Emotional Distress
So my parents are narcissists and their unrelenting abuse could be the culprit for my BPD obviously along with my predisposition for it I stopped being my mom s narcissistic supply I stopped calling her and texting her and trying to get her to love me Every time I would invite her out she would say she couldn t go for some excuse Why I was trying to convince myself I could get them to love me is beyond me Denial I guess Anyways So I m out of that I moved about 50 miles away they come to this city often for other things and I invited them to my house warming party They didn t show up or call or anything I haven t heard from them since early June when I moved and for all they know I could be dead My sister well I have enforced some boundaries with her for the first time and now she has dumped me as well We used to be best friends I am unable to sleep at night I obsessively check facebook instagram tumblr for some sign that she is in agony as well I wrote her an email like PLEASE just talk to me No response All because I told her I didn t want to drive in rush hour traffic to the mall She never drives I always drive She never pitches in for gas or anything She was late to my house As usual By the time she wanted to go it was full blown rush hour traffic and I couldn t do it So I said let s just hang out around the neighborhood and she said no she wanted the mall so it was mall or nothing So it was nothing Her boyfriend has been a straight up DICK to me for the past six months She finally admitted to seeing it as well after gaslighting me for six months Thanks sister So I told her to fuck off for that Now it s been a month and it s just her taking smiling selfies and ignoring me I FUCKING FUCKING HATE HER I also fucking hate my parents Is this the BPD that is making me so full of rage and sadness and irrational thoughts and victim mentality I am so tempted to delete every social media account I have and change my phone number so I can move on Thanks for reading,Emotional Distress

I know this is my second post this evening but I m having a bit of a day I m just thinking about when it comes to the point where you know you need to cut someone out of your life and how to deal with that because of the need to have people close to you deliberately removing someone goes right against the grain This guy has been emotionally abusing me for the best part of a year Even though I ve known for a while that what he s doing is abuse because I used to trust him so much he s already managed to gaslight me to the extent that I have barely any grip on reality and I don t know how to trust my instincts He s told me I m a liar I m a bitch but it s my fault I m offended at that that I bully him I called him irresponsible that I m delusional won t give any back up for this one I was hoping he would change as we all do but I really don t think he will I told him my conditions for him continuing to speak to me are that he gets therapy and stops making up lies about me but I don t think he s going to do either because he insists there s nothing wrong with him part of me suspects he s one of that handful of BPD people that goes around giving the rest of us a bad rep because a lot of his behaviour is related to whether or not he thinks I m rejecting him Basically I need to cut him out I just don t know how I can t do it right now because he s actually staying over at my house for a few days but next month when I m back in my university halls it will be easier I just can t deal with the loss Him as a person I don t want around but it s the idea of losing one of two people in the whole world who actually knows me Losing the history and memories I have because that s a whole fourteen months of stability and feelings of self worth tied to him that will be too painful to handle I ve already lost most of 16 17 because of a previous partner who made me feel shit and I don t want to lose even more of my youth I don t want to cut out someone who says they love me even though they clearly don t respect me at all Not to mention mentally I m at rock bottom and I have maybe one person who can support me Plus my family will want to know where the guy is because he s supposed to be one of my best friends and I don t know how to deal with telling them because I don t want them knowing details since it ties in to my mental health and they ve proven incapable of dealing nicely with me being mentally ill,Emotional Distress
I almost posted this to r Confession but thought better of it I just need to vent If you don t want to read the whole thing just read the last paragraph the bolded one and if you have any advice it s greatly appreciated So Where do I begin Basically it had to have been like a year or so ago that a close friend of mine dropped dead suddenly at the age of 19 No drugs or booze were in his system he didn t have any known preexisting conditions he just dropped dead in the middle of the night He was awake when it happened This fucked me up really badly I already have diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder which was undiagnosed at the time so I m always one small thing from being pushed to suicidal thoughts I had gone through a lot in my life to that point but never had I gotten serious about attempting suicide This friend was really close to me and I felt abandoned again Anyways one aborted suicide later after the funeral I was in a really dark place And then I met this girl We hit it off almost immediately We were very much alike We came from similar backgrounds except she loved both her parents She had her own set of issues on top of the stuff that made her like me After she found out about my suicide attempt during a very long and deep conversation we had she made it her personal mission to make me happy again And it worked I was happy for the first time since I was 8 years old when my Grandpa was still around We celebrated Thanksgiving at her family s house we celebrated Christmas together and I felt like I had a real family They had their own issues but for the most part they loved each other and that was more than I could say about my family I lost my only good father figure when my Grandpa died My own father was a colossal asshole who took pride in beating the shit out of me and making me feel like crap about myself before he abandoned the family when I was 12 My birthday came a month and a half later and she told me that she loved me something that I had been avoiding saying until then as I was afraid that I d jump the gun Within two days of my birthday though she said that she couldn t handle my emotional roller coaster and my abandonment issues anymore and she didn t want to see me anymore I never really recovered from that She had helped make me so much happier and in an instant she broke my heart and all the progress I made went down the shitter About a month later I attempted failed and came into one of my professor s office in a horrible state of mind I was bouncing off the walls wondering why I couldn t finish the job They called in the ambulance to have me taken to the hospital and I ended up getting diagnosed with BPD there while in a 24 hour psych ward hold I ve been seeing a psychiatrist and a clinical social worker since So I took a break from dating Fast forward to April and a friend tries to get me back on the horse He sets me up with a girl a great girl who is probably the most normal person I ve ever met We kind of hit it off It took us a bit to get rolling but the bottom line is that we like each other It s been about 3 months and about a week or so ago she went to visit her parents in Brazil for a month Here is the problem I m facing I don t care if she cheats on me I personally am holding back from getting completely attached to her because I m afraid I m gonna get hurt again I m pushing this great girl away who when she gets back is gonna be happy to see me and we ll resume our relationship and all that fun stuff I m still hung up on my ex Wishing that I hadn t fucked things up wondering if I had done anything different would the result have been different I m pushing away everyone because I was abandoned by the closest friend I ve ever had in my ex The bottom line is that I m stuck on my ex and my BPD is involved I m not sure whether I should post this at all and probably will delete this in a few minutes but if anyone has any advice on how to allow myself to get over my ex and allow myself to get close to someone again I ll gladly take it Anything to keep me from feeling like this any longer,Emotional Distress
So basic DBT principles and I do not get along at all Is there anything that has helped anyone else that doesn t rely on the same sort of mind over matter mindset,Emotional Distress
It s not your mind or your heart or your body but there s some part of a human that has to do with just feeling fucking accepted Feeling like you belong A sense of community Self respect Dignity Feeling like you re worth something Feeling like you re equal to everyone else at least at the base level Feeling like you re part of this species Being connected to others Being loved Loving others The desire to love others the desire to be loved The chance to actually live up to your potential To not be alone To not be afraid of being alone Constantly To not be afraid at all To not have nightmares To not wake up dreading your existence dreading the fact that you re conscious again It has to do with friends family lovers being together with others Having others there for support for protection for meaning Some part that encompasses all of these things Maybe it s an ethereal part of you maybe your soul I don t believe in souls But it s physical too when that part hurts it can physically hurt I hate that feeling It feels like fire is running through my body It s like its in my nervous system Usually my chest hurts the worst I can describe BPD for myself in that way Whatever part of a human all of that is for me it s been damaged very badly and hurts very often I don t like it And it s hard to forget It binds you It s hard to escape I don t like it,Emotional Distress

Before I realized what was going on with my head I stayed in school for seven years trying to finish a Bachelor s in English I started at a private university then to community college then a state school I did finish my A A and junior college was less of a struggle less intimidating I had good attendance but poor coursework I d wait until the night before the due date to do anything because that worked for me in high school and then have a panic attack when I was overtired and overworking myself Once I found out my first year that I could take an incomplete grade and take an additional whole year to finish a semester s coursework I requested them every single semester And my professors save one allowed it How I m sure they talk to each other about me that weirdo who can never finish a class and wastes all their time because she s just sitting there My last semester before calling it quits I had two incomplete classes to finish and one class to graduate I failed them all but walked the graduation stage anyway I knew I had failed and felt so guilty and anxious all day being so stupid to let my family believe I d finally finished I know now I put my professors in white and myself in black and that s why I couldn t give them the imperfect work I d done They have Ph Ds They re SO SMART and intimidating I want to be their friend because I want to know what they know but I m dumb so they don t like me obviously I can t accept their criticism so I never went to office hours or turned in a rough draft though when I was required I d often get lost daydream in their personal accouterments and bookshelves while they wondered at my wonder When I do turn in papers and finish classes I generally get B s though I ve only ever seen a professor s written notes on a paper a handful of times I still think about the times I ve gotten B s when I really shouldn t have because I didn t do all the coursework and I see it as a sympathy vote I call into question whether I have actually learned anything from the hours I have something like 140 or if I m a dummy who s just been pushed through I also think it s worth it to mention I failed my freshman English class and I ve never changed my major because that was my subject in high school TL DR I have three classes some to up my GPA to go to get my four year degree but I m terrified to do imperfect coursework and have to turn it in for criticism a grade Any suggestions,Emotional Distress
Does anyone else here apologize WAY TOO MUCH Any time I ve upset someone I end up apologizing for all of it Sometimes it s warranted but sometimes it s probably not I think I just can t handle someone I m close to being upset at me It triggers the abandonment fears way too much and I immediately jump into crisis mode trying to fix the situation by taking complete responsibility even though sometimes people get upset at each other and that s normal and okay How do you stop yourself or moderate this behavior,Emotional Distress
Whenever it s the end of the weekend or one like this that involved a lot of fun my anxiety rises and I have this feeling of dread and discomfort Monday morning is usually hazy and it feels as though I need the entire day to wake up I thought for awhile when I was in college it was just having homework work errands etc but has continued a few years after graduating Does anyone have any suggestions to help ease this or a habitual activity I can do Sunday afternoons night that can help I m a huge podcast comedy nerd so that helps a little but I d like to work on preventing these crashes rather than distracting myself with entertainment at work to bounce back,Emotional Distress
So throwaway here as my nonSO is on Reddit Two concerns about a relationship I m in with a non that I thought some folks here would have insights to share So as usual a relationship starts and I split her white I mean white Perfect in every way and amazing and nothing could be wrong This relationship shows promise and a lot of fun is had Then the split ends but I don t split her black That rare shade of grey turns up instead Things become boring The promise that was there is unknown the amazement that was there has dulled and what I want out of the relationship is unclear I still have feelings for her and have fun when it is had and still feel warm and squishy when in her presence or at least at the start of it But at the end of a date hangout etc I question if the relationship is worth it and if it is what I want Now what Accept the mediocrity of course I m being over dramatic here and see how it goes or move on Second thing is how much slack to cut her with triggers She yelled at me while experiencing some stress induced hallucinations She was freaked out but yelled at me pretty fierce The kind of yelling that would be considered scolding The kind of yelling that one would do at a misbehaving pet The kind of yelling that if there wasn t disregulation on her part I would have walked away Yelling is a pretty bad trigger for me it brings back memories of my yelling at others and what that cost me and I m still shaken up about it even though it happened 10 days ago Do I give her a pass If this relationship continues there will be moments where I am not well there will be moments when I split her black and moments when the tables will have turned She will likely give me a pass when my BPD creates similar feelings of fear So I believe that it is only fair to give her a pass on this yelling But what do you think Thanks for your time and insights TL DR No longer splitting white with GF and she inadvertently triggered me not sure what to do,Emotional Distress
I ve tried inflow and Mood Panda and one by Mind but found them all to be fairly linear and not necessarily helpful when I need extra stuff I ve also tried Habit RPG but I found it made me feel bad when I failed to complete things So I guess what I want is something kind of like a journal so I can keep tabs on things er I guess like eating I don t really like calorie counting apps because they trigger disordered eating but I definitely need to lose some weight so I stop feeling so crappy about myself Drinking I basically only drink coffee and rum and I m always dehydrated and I need to drink water but lack the motivation desire Being able to write down good things I ve done Like cuddling with my SO brushing my cat doing housework positives that I should be doing regularly that if they re written down I might feel a bit better about them Things I got done at work Exercise yoga especially Reading I m not really sure what I m looking for but I don t have the patience to journal everything and thought an app might be handy I dunno Sometimes just seeing things I ve done written down makes me feel a little better Sorry if I m rambling too much DX,Emotional Distress
Hi okay this is hard Maybe it s the reason I finally joined Reddit I survived BPD I started devising coping skills before I knew I had BDP I lost so much to it Family friends lovers So much I was often alone and scared Screaming crying asking the universe why Scared of being hurt Over and over Scared to trust To love I also have still have it mildly PTSD I finally lost as much as I could to the f ing illness I lost the one My love and my soul mate I was his artichoke and he was my Branberry I want to share my story of how I took my life back How I took my past present and future and for once demanded not to be controlled For over a year I have been in remission from BPD I want to share my story Does anyone wish to hear it Edit Let s start here Hi It is not a death sentence but let me tell you it scares the hell out of me just talking about it It makes me remember Remember how it felt Every day Always the same Never able to escape Wishing I could leave my own body just for an hour A break Just a break was all I wanted I have a break now Everyday for over a year Every single day I wake up and know I m not sick anymore and not doomed to die alone But sometimes I remember and have to say like a mantra when the panic seeps in that it ll come back I did it If I can give just one person a break it ll all be worth it Everyone with BPD knows how bad it sucks How many times you hit rock bottom How hard it is The struggle So understand that I know pain and struggle because I think it s fair to warn you all that recovering from BPD is not easy by any means In fact it is the hardest thing I ve ever done So sorry for the delay in responding It s a very busy time in my life Due to the amount of PMs and responses I think it s best if I start a blog I will let you know when it is up It ll be easier for me this way I think I m going to respond to everybody the same way so you guys see my edit Again sorry very busy I want to try to make this journey as personal as needed once the blog is up I hope I can get it up by Friday Please feel free to ask me questions Edit 2 Please read my comments below as well I am new to reddit so please excuse any ways I post that may be less than perfect Also I d appreciate if you guys were understanding of how very hard this is to talk about and give me some slack as I form this into coherent thought,Emotional Distress
It really bothers me when people say stuff like that after witnessing a death or someone in your family falling ill or dying or just when people around you are suffering Why should I feel bad or feel sad because someone else is suffering I don t understand It makes me feel almost autistic I hate using mental disabilities illnesses as a description but I really cannot think of another word to describe how I feel I am sorry when people expect me to feel emotions because they are expressing them I m not emotionally connected to anything My family my pets friends could drop dead right now and I wouldn t blink They all had purpose in my life I d find new people to replace those purposes This coldness bothers me I don t like objectifying all my relationships it does make me feel disconnected but I hate when people say that the coldness makes me inhuman Who are they to judge what emotions are right to feel or not We aren t all perfect We aren t all capable of compassion empathy and connection I also hate when people call me a sociopath like an insult Like I didn t already know I was so disconnected and cold Like it s my fault T_T fuck off BPD comes in all different shapes and colours It s not just the over experiencing of emotions it s also the lack thereof,Emotional Distress

I met this fucking girl and we went on one stupid fucking date and then we sent a bunch of stupid fucking texts back and forth and then we didn t talk for a while and then we started texting again and then I got my heart stomped on by someone else and then I started to rely on her for emotional support because I was walling myself off from everyone I loved moreso than usual and then she kept agreeing to see me but never followed through and then I said some mean shit and then I sent a bunch of stupid fucking texts and then I tried to cut her off and then she pulled me back in like she always did and then a bunch of messages started showing up online about her and now I m thinking about moving just to be with her and I promise myself I won t think about her but everything reminds me of her and I m coming out of a bout of psychosis in which I thought she was my guardian angel and I just want to see her one more time to clear things up I JUST CAN T STAND THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS FUCKING WITH ME THE WHOLE TIME IT S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT She was the first person I opened up to and I can t bear the thought that I was just some joke to her She seemed so kind and goofy and mysterious when we met at least she acted that way ANd now I think it was probably all part of some ploy to tease me basically And since then I ve been fucked over by a bunch of girls and now every time I see one I can t bear the thought of asking them out especially if they seem nice If they seem bitchy I can just ask them out then not give a shit if they reject me but the thought of getting rejected by a nice girl drives me nuts And this post really has no point I m just so fucking lonely and feel like I can t do anything until I find a companion With the exception of 3 weeks which ended in complete heartbreak and emasculation I ve woken up and gone to sleep on my own every night It just gets so fucking draining and depressing and it shouldn t be this hard In the past month I ve asked out like 6 nurses inpatient and given my number to a few other girls but they all either had boyfriends or never got back to me Given I was out of town for a few of those I m good looking I m nice I m hilarious I m weird it really shouldn t be this hard And I know the answer is just to get my life back together and put myself in more places where I ll meet girls but it s really difficult with this much trauma and loneliness floating around my head PLus the ADD makes it so that I can focus on shit for like 2 seconds at a time before I m like ooh a butterfly or some shit I DUNNO FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK I just want someone here tonight Not a gf Just a girl to watch movies and shit with Girls calm me the fuck down A guy would be nice too but I find it much easier to be aroun girls And that s not gonna happen ANd my ffamily is at the beach without me because they think I m a fucking psycho I am but them putting me in the hospital everytime I tried to do anything made me progressively worse every time fuck inpatient unless you re actually suicidal don t send your familiy or friends there for acting weird Anyone wanna talk Edit Feel much better now She s old news If I see her again cool but she would have a lot of explaining to do There s someone out there that s perfect for me and I ll find her,Emotional Distress

So my boyfriend s sister and I had a falling out a while ago We haven t been facebook friends or spoken in months Now and then she ll like one of the statuses I tag him in but generally she stays away from me and I stay away from her Today she made a comment that sincerely hurt my feelings left it up for a while then deleted it I have no idea who may have seen it in the meantime I posted about a trip my boyfriend and I took yesterday and mentioned we were shopping in a small touristy area with cute shops She replied Don t spend too much of YOUR hard earned money Why this is hurtful my boyfriend is fairly well off due solely to his work ethic and crazy awesome business that he started in college I m constantly terrified that people in his family will think I m a gold digger because he s giving me a place to live paying my school tuition paying my bills basically completely supporting me while I m in school No one knows the full details but they all kind of suspect know that he does I m a proud person and it was incredibly hard for me to get used to this I m still not entirely comfortable with him paying my bills I buy our groceries with my food stamps as my way of contributing to the household But I generally worry about people getting the wrong idea Her posting that makes me wonder if he s said something to her about spending his money on supporting me I m terrified of the answer to that question if it s yes I want nothing more than to be able to provide for myself I was making ends meet when he came into my life but he s given me a chance to really better myself and my life by going back to school for a degree that will actually get me a steady job This is getting a lot longer than I wanted it to be My question is this how would you respond The comment has been deleted but it was up for at least 30 minutes I don t know what members of our families saw it and don t know how to handle the awkward if they did see it I just texted him at 3 AM when she deleted it letting him know what she d said because I want him to side with me on this and say something to her about how that was inappropriate Is that too much to ask of someone I m asking because I honestly don t know I just know how I would react if my brother had posted something like that which he wouldn t because he isn t an asshole Thanks in advance for any advice TL DR boyfriend s sister posted a bitchy comment on facebook left it up for a while then deleted it I have no idea if my reaction is appropriate and no idea how to respond,Emotional Distress
I ve had quite a rough life and it s why this break I m dealing with is more difficult than any of the past I was invalidated abused and bullied for most of my childhood and have always been an extremely emotionally sensitive person My personality type is INFJ as well so it doesn t help matters All I ve ever wanted was true love ever since I was around thirteen I always listened to other guys talk about girls and their bodies and other such things and felt such a disconnect I just wanted someone to protect and enjoy life with that s all When I connect with another person I reveal so much and I let people in to the point of no return My first love cheated on me towards the end and cut me out of her life completely after being with me for three years I spent the next four years hanging with my friends and dealing with a perpetual loneliness and deep sense of fear each day I had panic attacks regularly and by the time I was somewhat healed another girl found me and despite telling myself I wouldn t enter another relationship well it happened again We were insanely close to the point where we would explore every topic imaginable with each other We covered so much ground and now everything in life has her fingerprints on it and I can t help but notice it all of the time We also studied psychology together and began to unravel everything that was wrong with us We had an inseparable bond but as time grew on I became more anxious tried to work multiple jobs to no avail and became more housebound She wanted me to do more and could see I wasn t moving forward and this drove her to the point of no longer caring Her love dissolved into a bitterness which I can understand and it makes me hate myself We went from something indescribable to something horrible During the past 16 months she would often cycle between loving and adoring me to putting me down giving me the cold shoulder and saying horrible things to me I noticed that she herself had triggers and I feared these triggers dearly and felt on eggshells with her after some time There were often attacks on my character and complete invalidation towards my BPD or rather she just wouldn t get how I couldn t turn it off My suffering probably felt exaggerated to her I stuck with it took every blow but was always true to love and protective and there for her Recently she decided she was done despite saying some of the most affectionate and long term things to me within that same month She suspected in the past that she might have BPD herself from serious past abuse and I can t help but wonder with how many triggers she had and how there would always be weird tension I m no saint myself and had my moments of being manipulative but it was mostly telling little white lies over food portions and being controlling from time to time It was never major or overboard She just really wanted to see me doing more and I could tell she felt on a time schedule or something like life was passing her by too quickly all of a sudden and with that realization she just disconnected entirely She now wants to be alone and focus on herself for a year and I do respect this and understand why I could be loving myself more and truthfully we both need to grow as individuals as we spent almost every waking moment together for three years But anyways I see guys trying to flirt and get with her and she doesn t mind and she s really just ignoring everything and shutting me out but still sticking around and trying to be friends with me at the same time It s very difficult and tonight I had two panic attacks as a result I just lose all sense of logic entirely and my emotions pin me down until I realize that I m just struggling with myself Also it doesn t help that when I type in BPD and Breakups into Google all I get are warnings of how crazy people with BPD are and I have to hunt for anything from the point of view of a BPD person experiencing the pain themselves,Emotional Distress

So a big part of my bpd is my inability to handle any extreme emotions Don t get me wrong this has been under control for a while now I ve been pretty happy in life and it s been a long time since things have felt that way But when it did show its face it was things like extreme anger at partners hitting or extreme lack of self worth It also showed itself in extreme happiness too having to hug someone tightly or jump up and down when excited etc In short extreme emotions are a problem for me I feel I feel too much Maybe that s something some other bpd suffers can relate to I write this after self harming slightly after five years without I ve built myself strong over the years but things gradually have slipped a little down hill lately to make me not as happy and then a random experience of mistaking a friend for a friend had me looking for some release I don t even know why This shouldn t have happened I m better than this I ve taught myself better I ve been more down than this at various points It was a relapse But for me it was more about control Being able to harness that emotional pain that I had no way to be in control of and turn it in to physical pain where I was the one in charge It was a release It always was There was no need for me to do it this time no real need but it was just a random poor decision Like losing loads of weight and randomly having a cupcake when you know that if you actually wanted it you would have held off built it up made it actually be because of something I ve relapsed over nothing Anyway I just thought I d share I ve had a really great few years so those of you that are struggling believe me it can and WILL get better Keep going I was just looking to share my thoughts and hopefully have a few positive affirmations from others who d been through something similar I could do with the positive reinforcement Stay strong you re never alone Always reach out if you re in trouble People will surprise you with their loveliness just try and give them a chance I hope anyone reading this who s going through a tough time know that things will only end up getting better in the long term In the meantime your redditiors are here We re just you with different usernames Stay strong x Have any other sufferer found themselves doing that This was a relapse for me for sure and one I doubt I ll repeat But it was a more thought out exchange than when I used to self harm that I knew I was doing it just because taking control of the pain I was feeling was more manageable,Emotional Distress
Lately my actions have been severely BPD with the exception of the impulsiveness physically at least I won t cheat steal or anything like that But the black and white thinking about people has been off the wall Like I ll be talking to someone they ll be being nice and suddenly I ll convince myself that they have it out for me they re trying to humiliate me or some other thing and I ll suddenly want to tell them to get the fuck away from me or I ll have intrusive thoughts and want to lash out physically I wasn t like this most of my life I ve always been on the spectrum and fit a lot of the criteria at times but I ve basically been acting like a male version of angelina jolie from girl interrupted just batshit With moments of being completely normal too I don t know if I qualify for BPD because I don t really change my personality to mirror other people sorry if I m stereotyping but I do change the way I act to sort of fit around other peoples personalities including becoming an asshole if someone is an asshole to me I dunno I m not asking for a diagnosis but do the two manifest in simmilar ways in people The PTSD is from being publicly humiliated and toyed with by a bunch of people who aren t worth my time in case you were wondering I guess I m just confused and lost and would like to post here even if I don t have a diagnosis Is that cool,Emotional Distress

I was diagnosed with BPD OCD and severe anxiety almost 6 years ago After multiple stints in hospitals two suicide attempts and A LOT of therapy I would consider myself pretty well I graduated university 14 months into a career and getting married in 5 months I do find myself relapsing during periods of stress which I think is understandable I have been quite stressed with my work quite a negative work environment and experiencing some bullying the wedding finances and generally suffering from a low self esteem as a result When I was really sick I would thrive off attention specifically people thinking I am beautiful attractive I was never promiscuous but enjoyed men wanting me specifically in the romantic sense not just physically It made me feel powerful I was wanted but they could never have me I would also crush quite quickly on men but never act on it physically more emotionally I never did this whilst being with my fiance and worked really hard to let that aspect of my condition go I had to go away for a week for work It was a week of partying and schmoozing I found myself falling into that habit again particularly because people were drunk and very honest with their opinions with me this also helped me a lot with my career There was one guy in particular we work in the same building I think due to low self esteem and alcohol that I indulged in my bad habit Now that I am back home I am feeling really low and guilty I find myself craving that attention and being wanted again I am afraid that I am self sabotaging that I am going to ruin myself but more importantly my relationship My fiance is incredible and doesn t deserve a woman who does this I am afraid of myself,Emotional Distress

So my boyfriend just started orientation a couple of days ago and they re away on an overseas trip That means he has limited wifi and apparently there s a pretty strict phone discipline policy and he hasn t really been able to text or call All the while I ve slowly been going out of my mind Äî I find myself struggling to remember if he s real In preparation for this I actually took a video of the both of us before he left and now I m just constantly watching it in an attempt to convince myself that he is Logically I know he s been trying his best to talk to me whenever he can But sometimes the resentment just builds up and I start wondering if he s really trying as much as he says he is I start convincing myself that he could do this he could do that he could talk to me more often but he just isn t bothering to maybe because he s forgotten me and isn t thinking of me or maybe because he s just having more fun with other people When I recognize that I m being unreasonable I try to pull myself out of it but I end up feeling guilty and worthless And all of that is building upon the thought that I m such a failure for not being able to cope with my boyfriend being away for a week Last night he only managed to talk to me at midnight Before that he d said he was going for dinner with the group and would talk to me then as the place was going to have wifi After that he explained that the place didn t have wifi after all and they got lost finding their way back to the hotel and were slowly making their way back And I just lost it In my head it was like I am dying here and you decide to slowly STROLL BACK I got angry and he got defensive Later on I apologized and he s been understanding but I still feel like crap My therapist isn t free until 2 days later so I m stuck unfortunately,Emotional Distress

I have recently been diagnosed and I m feeling rather overwhelmed trying to understand everything Since a child I have experienced very vivid day dreams When I was around 10 I was in my room on a world of my own I would often sit silently zoned out in a day dream All of a sudden I imagined the house was on fire I was just sat there imagining the smoke the fire alarm beeping I was trapped but I didn t panic I just sat there and started to cry the more I thought about how my family might not make it out and I would be alone in my room with no one to help me It was so real More recently I was at work and my mind ran off again to a place where my son dies and my partner and I separate as a result Planning a funeral All that gruesome stuff I was walking g around with a lump in my throat I began to believe it like I do with most of these day dreams I had to take time out from my duties to phone home TWICE to make sure everything was okay and my fianc and son were safe I was so relieved I broke down in the bathrooms at work Are these delusions hallucinations or dissociative I really don t know what to call them My mind goes off on a journey I can t stop it Even if I snap out of it for a second and tell my brain to stop making stories it pulls away again and before I know it it feels real It hurts it s emotionally draining I even can t sleep some nights because I m convinced there is something under my bed I m 22 of Christ s sake I shouldn t be afraid of my imagination or its monsters but it shakes me to my core it s too real What would this be called if it was to be labeled as a symptom I m waiting for my next therapy appointment to come through this will be discussed with my doctor at some point,Emotional Distress

I 23F and my brother 26M made a deal today This was after my mom and brother kept me up until 1am with angry texts because every time they have an argument they have to drag me into it and make me act as moderator and then insult me if I disagree with either side and call me a phony if I refuse to pick sides They have been having the same dumb pointless argument for 15 years and I always get caught in the crossfire So the agreement we made I will deal with our mom classic violent volatile and invalidating Nparent from now on deal with her dramas and look out for her when she gets old He doesnt have to have anything to do with her anymore if he doesnt want to and in fact I strongly recommended to both of them that they go NC They agreed to not speak to each other for a few months He will deal with our dad pathological liar manipulator lives off the government bc he is too lazy to work and spent all his money on strippers and various other poor life decisions Once again make sure he doesnt die alone etc I will talk to my dad but will not be required to fix his problems take him in if he becomes homeless again etc Im getting some money when I turn 25 from my grandma s estate and that will be family money for any emergencies or poor life decisions made by any of these people I call my family I told him I dont know which of us is getting screwed more So this is my life Every member of my immediate family has the impulse control and self centeredness of a toddler We have to divide responsibilities for emotionally dealing with our parents outbursts and manipulations and I have to moderate a time out separation for my mom and brother as if they are little kids I have to worry about financially providing for not only myself and my future kids but possibly my dad and brother too at least my mom manages money well This is my family Who else has crazy family stories Let s hear them,Emotional Distress

I m going to try to make this as short as I can without leaving out much I thank anybody who reads this Let me start first by saying that I m a 25 year old Male from Eastern Canada o Until I was around 6 years old I was fairly happy and outgoing until randomly my personality shifted with regards to how I perceive the world and how I present myself I lost my sense of self at some point in my early childhood I cut myself off from my family and felt like I couldn t turn to anybody and now that I m almost 26 I can t say that things are much different than they used to be I completely understand why this is often titled as one of the worst mental illnesses to have Invalidation and shaming almost works like the snowball effect building momentum and building more layers around the true self as things go on day after day Anyways to my childhood I suppose My Mother is a good woman deep down but she constantly invalidated and would twist anything that I would say to the point where I felt completely stupid and began to doubt everything I would do or say It wasn t uncommon for her to forcefully toss me outside of the house because as she would put it It isn t normal for a kid your age to be stuck inside of the house and that s when it all started to some degree My Mother would lose her patience more and more and had a pre determined path for me to walk down based on her own judgments and fears Anything that I said was discard ignored or downplayed on a constant basis She slapped me from time to time and I got the belt a dozen or more times during my childhood I was grounded and given time out on a constant basis despite being one of the most quiet and timid children that my parents had ever met at the time My Father well there s not a whole lot to say He s a bit of a narcissist to this day well not a bit as he stares in the mirror at himself for hours on end and will do anything to get what he wants but besides that he is an emotionally damaged man who means well it s just throughout my childhood he was completely emotionally absent and never taught me anything about life My Father never took me outdoors often and if he did it was because my Mother forced him to They were disconnected from each other throughout my entire life and would scream and fight often He would argue with her about how he wasn t getting enough sex and I heard this often and she would make jabs at him on a constant basis over every little thing The man lived on egg shells but really wasn t fit to be a parent himself neither of them were and I m surprised that they had three children Anyways it was because of this atmosphere that I predict I have developed into who I am My personality type is INFJ for anybody interested in that stuff and as a child and especially now I am intensely capable of reading facial expressions and other seemingly invisible queues to determine if somebody is lying or is being inauthentic and I am able to recognize the pain of others without them even saying anything It has not been uncommon for complete strangers at previous jobs and such to reveal their entire life to me rather quickly Still reading people can also cause me to irrationally interpret what others are saying to me I really do take everything to heart and I m a pushover because of it I ve spent countless days in my life trying to cater to my family friends and significant others simply because I have an intense fear of abandonment and I always spiral into the darkest of moods when feeling these ways I really do believe people hate me or that something very bad will happen for no reason and to this day I don t think I ve ever truly relaxed and enjoyed the now or present moment as deeply as all of my friends and others I ve met in life I m always on edge Throughout school I was shamed often and I have vivid memories of having to take a number two as a child when I was in day care and barely able to form coherent sentences and so I did it outside hidden at the bottom of a hill The other kids noticed and made fun of me and the teachers made me pick it up with a bag in front of the other kids and to this day I recognize this as one of the many initial triggers I was bullied often for being timid and throughout my life I put myself down on a constant basis and believed what others were saying about me I felt useless and felt I had no potential I could only dream of love and I felt disconnected and would sleep often and roll around my bed having the most introspective and horrifying mood swings I lived in fear and anticipation for at least half of my life I remember my Mother telling me that if I failed a particular exam to not come home and that I wouldn t be welcomed back All these little tactics to instill fear into me that I interpreted as pure abuse which made me hide my true self even more Since High School I have tried working a slew of jobs but at this point am far too sensitive for reality Still for somebody who deals with as much anxiety and depression as I do I have worked some of the most fast paced retail jobs and I ve experimented with hallucinogens and have went down roads that I never thought were possible I became addicted to cigarettes at one point and had a major marijuana dependency as well despite disliking anybody who had any relation to drugs for my entire life I have so learned so much about reality and I m often praised for my ability to see both the good and bad in something and I have great skills at articulating vast thoughts regarding the state of society and the world in general I know I m a talented writer but beyond that I have no sense of self I can use my body and do normal things but I don t have an established connection to myself deep down I understand my own emotions and thoughts greatly but there s still a great disconnect or doubt inside I m a very aware human constantly taking notes from my environment constantly creative in some way yet people around me never see this side of me and just assume I m lazy and blowing things out of proportion My Father has changed over the years since dealing with a divorce and his own social anxiety and has recently apologized for his emotional absence and tough attitude which I greatly appreciated My Mother is still in denial and doesn t believe a word I say most of the time She still invalidates me daily and assumes I read too much and that only Doctors and Teachers are qualified to say anything and that I m just uneducated I will say that I ve been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and ADD neither of which I agree with I ve always suffered from daily mood swings and intense irrational perceptions of life Literally a room can become horrifyingly disfigured on some level just by how I m feeling Fear can become a pit of darkness and feelings of abandonment and my own disconnection to others tortures me at times in ways that I cannot simply turn off the pain is unbearably vivid and intense and nobody will ever know just how sensitive I am to everything because words only go so far in society People doubt everything and just assume that because their biology and upbringing doesn t support something that everybody else must be blowing things out of proportion Back to my previous diagnosis I ve tried a slew of medication from SSRIs anti psychotics to anti anxiety medication and over the course of three years that I did this I ended up nearly going psychotic and having the craziest dreams and forms of anxiety physical and mental I haven t taken any type of pharmaceutical drug in at least 10 months and it s clear that these were doing far more damage than good I really do believe that far too many people are misdiagnosed these days and that there are too many disorders that mimic each other greatly making truly diagnosing people even more difficult It doesn t help that psychiatrists throw pills at people like it s nothing To bring this to a close I will say that BPD is likely spread far throughout my Mother s side of the family as her own Father was the bad seed that ruined everybody else I found out recently that my Grandfather raped my Mother s siblings and would beat her Brothers One of her Brothers ended up raping his daughers as a result and this is part of why my Dad was so cut off when I was a child He feared ever leaving me home and apparently this is why he never did get a job Both of my parents are damaged immature and very alone people and I know in my heart that they both need to see a psychologist but I know that their view of the world is all they trust and nothing will change this This is extremely long far longer than I thought it would be but getting all of this off of my chest is a good feeling I ve left out so much but then again I can t comment on every single thing or this thing would be ridiculously long I hope to better understand myself in the years to come and I hold no resentment towards my parents as I do feel they meant well they just thought their forced methods would work on me and didn t know that I was an extremely emotionally sensitive person and still am It is what it is I guess If anybody can relate I would very greatly appreciate reading what you would have to say Also feel free to PM me any questions or anything Thank you and take care everybody,Emotional Distress
Today was one of the first good days in a while Sunshine good food friends And then I came back home My SO happy to see me but as soon as my eyes meet his I want to cry I choke it back Act normal We chat about our days briefly A friend walks in He s on drugs Good dude Great dude in fact but really high Drugs are a trigger for me Everything is a fucking trigger for me We talk He is telling SO it s time to go meet up with other friends I ask SO if he will be partaking He doesn t think so Which means there s a chance Trigger We had just last night had a very emotionally draining conversation for me and worked some things out I was happy they worked out This is the first relationship that I haven t been sabotaging from the start Things are going swimmingly I don t want to be with someone who is going to use Trigger Internal conflict Love over my own well being my own self control Or am I just past being around users My youth was spent in a tear filled haze fueled with substances I do not want that to be my life It isn t my life anymore Am I overreacting Thinking about it too much Being too judgmental Or have I moved on from these things and no longer wish to toy around with them Is it possible to find sober people who haven t replaced their vocabulary with the 12 steps I d like to talk about this I know it would be unfair to ask him to not use just to be with me But then I don t know I am so drained These last 5 months have been so taxing the relationship is younger than that even that it s been hard for me to sort anything out Thanks for reading and if not then tl dr Everything is triggering me Drugs trigger me I m around a fair amount of them and my SO is a casual user which flipping triggers me,Emotional Distress
Exactly what it says on the tin This entire mess in my head has ruined my life I ve ruined my credit ruined almost all of the non abusive non codependent relationships I have and it s getting to the point where I m beginning to have trouble functioning at my job which is one of the few good things I really have left to define myself by I also have some pretty bad anxiety in general but what I ve read about seeking help for BPD is making the idea of going to a psychiatrist for diagnosis and help seem absolutely terrifying like the end of the world What if they don t believe me What if they think I m diagnosis shopping though why the hell anyone shopping for a diagnosis would pick BPD of all things I don t know So talk to me about how the hell one works through this kind of anxiety If anyone in the Anchorage Alaska area is reading this and has specific recommendations for a BPD friendly doctor that would be great but I just need some reassurance that seeking the help I know I need to recover isn t going to ruin what s left of my life Edit to remove a paragraph rereading it sounded like a roundabout way of asking for a diagnosis and to add I m going to set up an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow regardless because I also need help for the anxiety and compulsive issues I m dealing with but I really don t know how to go about asking about something like this once I have that appointment,Emotional Distress

I feel like the older I get the further I get away from who I am I feel like my whole life I was very opinionated and knew who I was and what I wanted to be I was a very creative person and I think more than anything that s how I saw myself I feel I have to rediscover myself relearn myself like I have to do a lot of journaling and really work out how I think and how I feel and what it all means It feels obvious but I really feel that if I just did one thing that feeds my creative spirit every day I would make progress and maybe my life would start going somewhere Slow baby steps I m a perfectionist and I have to understand something and immerse myself in it to get the ball rolling I guess it s a black and white thing I m obsessive But my lack of motivation or belief in myself or whatever it is stronger than all of that So I usually ruminate about all my plans and hopes and dreams like I m doing right now but then nothing ever comes of it Does anyone relate to this Is this mental illness or depression or just being a person,Emotional Distress
My most core traits and beliefs change suddenly and drastically with no discernible triggers Some examples 5 years ago I was gay I went and got a gay pride tattoo to prove I was serious I dated a girl I wanted to marry 5 years later I m straight as an arrow I want the tattoo removed I m not bisexual I m straight There was no in between My political ideology has flipped from one extreme to the other I went from being a social activist for acceptance of everyone to being a total bigoted shitlord in more ways than one I had a love for art and English all my life I went to university for it Now I m honoring in Math and can t fathom why I ever wanted to major in English This extreme shifts in personality even pervade things like my interests I used to love classic rock music and I hated pop music Now I can t stand rock music and only listen to pop music and people who are too cool to listen to modern music annoy the shit out of me In fact anyone that resembles what I used to be annoys me and I can t help it Is anyone else like this Is this extreme personality inconsistency a BPD thing Honestly it s kinda incapacitating me and my ability to follow through on every fucking thing in my life Is there a way to just stop changing so much,Emotional Distress
I m trying to get over it but to be honest I really can t Even people I consider open minded and are educated have very serious biases and believe things that are completely untrue Just today I mentioned BPD as a casual part of the conversation not as anything related to me personally and the person I was talking to reacted without knowing I suffer from it I do think highly of her and she is above average in many respects which just means that we are really dealing with the tip of the iceberg here She said that BPD people are aggressive and physically violent that s the hallmark of the disease Which I guess in some cases is true but it s a gross generalisation She immediately started guessing who at our workplace is borderline and started going for the names of my most disagreeable and viable colleagues she knows of people who are most disliked If this is the immediate reaction to BPD I m fucked I consider dropping this diagnosis altogether and identifying instead as a complex PTSD sufferer because I won t ever come out of this well No wonder my therapist refused to give me a diagnosis for years She knew it will hinder my efforts at trying to live a fulfilled life I also read in another post just today how SOs sometimes take advantage of the BPD label and use it as an excuse for their sorry behaviour What do you guys think Do you think the diagnosis is helpful in any way at all,Emotional Distress
I have most of my emotions under control most of the time now I have good days and bad like anyone I can see shades of grey now more often than not I can almost always calm myself before a real episode begins I can recognize and address unhelpful thoughts I can let emotions ebb and flow and I have a basic sense of self now On the whole I m doing very well I have a sticking point though I cannot stand to be treated or judged unfairly and I lose all rational thinking when it happens And let s face it it happens a lot The world is unfair not just to me but to everyone I can feel my face start to flush and I get embarrassed and angry I brood and obsess over the things that were said and done There was a minor run in with mall security that happened 20 years ago when I was a teenager that I still think about fairly often More recent or severe cases are even worse Do any of you guys have this problem Does anyone have any advice for learning to let go of unfair treatment I m not talking about rolling over and letting people walk all over me but when something unavoidable happens that isn t fair how do I stop stewing and being obsessed about it Radical acceptance helps but I seem to just be in a perpetual state of turning the mind about these incidents and unable to move any further I d also like to tips on the obsessive fixated thoughts and memories about this Sometimes they can be almost like a flashback while others times it s more of an abstract recollection Thanks in advance for any suggestions or even just validation,Emotional Distress
Hey I was wondering if anyone could offer me some help or support I was with my boyfriend for about 6 months which I m aware isn t that long and I probably have no right to be upset but it was a very lovely and affectionate 6 months I have anxiety and I ve been in a few nasty relationships but this was the first relationship I feel like I could properly relax in We were so open and relaxed around one another We skyped for a few hours the night before it happened and everything seemed great we were talking about him coming to see me and having dinner together joking about things it was basically just like any other night he told me he loved me and that he d message me whilst I was at work the next day to keep me company Then the next morning I got a phone call from him out of nowhere telling me he was breaking up with me and that he wasn t happy or excited to see me My first thought was is this a joke it was completely out of the blue and I ve just been left feeling confused and that I ve just been left to accept it and pick up the pieces literally at the end of the phone call he said to me we re just going round in circles now because you don t want to say bye Well why would I if you re not even willing to talk to me about what the problem is Just feel as if I ve got no closure at all I haven t messaged him since yesterday and I m trying to keep it that way to give us space but most of me really wants an explanation Help would be appreciated please x small edit he was diagnosed with BPD about 2 years ago and I was well aware of it throughout the relationship but he never once told me he was unhappy He seemed so happy around me,Emotional Distress

So that s a highly specific highly confusing title Sometimes I just can t word For anyone chronicling my relationship status of the week my SO and I are back together And things are going fantastic and wonderful and magical and I ve been so happy and that s not really why I m writing right now Well we were just wrapping up our nightly phone conversation about an hour ago I say something ridiculously offensive and stupid that in retrospect I can t believe I actually said for you nosies out there ily I joked about the validity of his religion Something you just don t do regardless of how close y all are I think that s why he just shut off instantly He insists that he s fine but then he hung up on me after saying Anyway I m done I ll talk to you later before I could get a Good night in He s not fine Anyway my first urge was to call him But I hadn t figured out that I d offended him possibly yet so I waited a little bit for him to realize he was being a little bit mean and call me back to apologize Then I started hyperanalyzing everything I said and started to worry Then I called him No answer I left him two facebook messages the first just saying Good night I love you so that he would wake up to it in the morning and realize I meant no ill will The second I sent about 20 mins later explaining how I understand I crossed a line and I m sorry if I offended him and that I respect all of his beliefs regardless of my own Now in the large scheme of things this is just a little something that can certainly be healed right back up with a small amount of time Maybe overnight or something And I fully recognize this But for some ungodly reason I can t stand it I can t stand one second of it I want to call him to apologize and ensure immediately that everything between us is okay But I know that nothing I say will make it instantly better he just needs some time to cool down If anything bugging him about it is going to make it a thousand times worse and burn everything to the ground I want so badly to be on good terms now and cause problems later on than let it simmer and be on good terms in the very near future onward Now I m just hating myself and refraining from calling the best I can I just want to hear him say good night or for him to see my messages at the very least I don t want him to go to bed angry with me,Emotional Distress
I don t want my responsibilities I don t want human interaction I just want to sleep I don t want to deal with anyone My boyfriend is just not the person I thought he was Or maybe he s not the person I want him to be He tries and it s never good enough for me I want to build a life with him I m tired of living here in my parents house It s like a circus in here My mom brings so many family members to live here because she s trying to do good or as she says i would want someone to do the same for my children but it s exhausting for people to constantly be in my face all the time I thought me and my boyfriend had a future We used to talk about it all the time He used to tell me he wanted to marry me all the time He used to tell me I was gonna move with him to Virginia next year How we were gonna do all these things Now he doesn t And I don t press him about it I want to but that ll only cause a fight or maybe I don t want to hear the truth which is maybe he just doesn t want to marry me anymore or he doesn t want me to move with him come January This long distance relationship is exhausting I try so hard Or I feel like I do I feel sad and rage in my heart I want to be productive and do things but my mind fucks me over I let my mom watch my son I m a horrible mom in that way maybe I feel like running away sometimes I feel like absolute shit I want to call my boyfriend and yell at him but I know I m gonna regret that I don t want to lose him But he doesn t love me like I need him to I just can t do it anymore,Emotional Distress
IT DRAINS ME TO BE NICE I can keep up a sweet conversation for 5 minutes TOPS before I call it quits It leaves me physically exhausted and even thinking about being nice drains me mentally It sickens me to think of being nice for so long I feel disgusted by myself and think Fucking Christ you re a WIMP Don t get me started on when family members come around I don t even talk I just nod and smile and try not to look like a bitch Whenever I want to say something nice to my SO mother brother or anyone close to me I physically can t My teeth hinge shut my lips tighten I walk away look away It s such a stupid and silly subconscious action but I can t help it The irony of it all To people who don t know me I m one of the nicest friendliest and most accepting people they know This will be my downfall My mother is tired of me being nice and respectful to every other random stranger on the planet but her and my boyfriend feels like I ve stranded him when I have friendly and hearty conversations with strangers Please help me figure out how to be nice without being tired,Emotional Distress

I ve been looking for one in the Oakland area of Pittsburgh and UPMC seemed like a great starting place for me until they told me theyre not accepting new patients and sent me to another facility only to learn that they couldnt accept me either because although i m a teenager I ll be entering college and therefore don t meet their requirements They sent me the phone numbers to a few places some of which I ve left voicemails only to never hear back from them I need help and I feel like I m stuck and I m not sure what to do,Emotional Distress
I m just going to say that what s about to follow is just depressing so proceed cautiously I ve debated on whether or not to post this song link since it s really not the most positive but it s fascinating to me so I m going to share it anyway Not only is it a beautiful song musically but the lyrics speak exactly to what my experience has been after being diagnosed and the feeling of going back over all of my relationships and discovering the part I ve played in damaging them You can t fix what you don t accept to be broken right Anyway I ve found myself thinking things like did I ever truly love him or was I in love with the idea of him making me whole Am I really fully loving if I m always holding back in an attempt to protect myself constantly on guard and pushing people away Do I ever love like I suspect healthier people do I m not sure These are things I m really going to have to focus on as I work toward recovery I suppose If anyone has any songs that have resonated with them that they d like to share add them below I d be interested in checking them out Thanks Damien Rice My Favourite Faded Fantasy https www youtube com watch v ayYwXA9u_qs,Emotional Distress

I ve noticed that we for people who don t feel we have identifiable personalities outside of BPD we talk a lot about ourselves I ve known it about myself but it seems pretty common with other people I know who have personality disorders It s not necessarily a bad thing but ever since realizing that I ve stopped talking to friends in fear of seeming selfish or narcissistic even with the amount of self deprecation I do that doesn t seem to erase it It s horrifying to think of being hated for being self absorbed when you hate yourself I can t even reply to stuff they ve said about themselves without somehow relating it to myself even if it s a lie or quoting someone else to fill the air Even if I care about what they ve shared with me nothing really comes to mind to add to the conversation I just don t have a personality and no real original thought Hopefully it isn t annoying I talked about myself again here Yikes Does anyone else with BPD feel or think the same Am I overthinking this Thanks,Emotional Distress
Ok I really need support and feel I have to vent about this Recently I got diagnosed with BPD and since then my life has just been turned upside down I have come to understand why my past has always been a hellish experience I ve always thought that it s the people around me that eventually turns out to be total assholes that only thinks about them selves That they have been using me for their own good Now I understand that my behavior may be a good part of why friends and loved ones doesn t stay with me and why I push them away I also understand why I feel so empty when alone I m an extreme chameleon I mirror people so much I can t see the difference between me and them When I m alone I feel like there are parts of me missing No wonder I stay in abusive relationships longer than most others would cope with Even more is missing when my girlfriend goes back home to her place I become like an empty shell It s come to a point where I avoid seeing her because I know the feelings when she leaves will be devastating I kind of hate my self even more I have a hard time coping with how to tell my girlfriend And Of course the fear of her leaving me is so big that I fear she will see me as a bad person and leave me if i tell her On the other hand I feel that if I don t tell her I just pull myself away from her slowly because of the fear of doing something really stupid that will result in chaos I have already accused her of enough weird things I really don t know how to deal with my thoughts and feelings First I see all the wrong things she and others has done to me then I come to terms with all that is wrong is because of how I behave My mind goes from total euphoria to depression and angst anger and hate so much during the day I can hardly do anything anymore I really don t know which feelings are wrong and which are true I don t know how to act at all anymore I guess as learn to live with BPD it gets easier step by step Right now I just try to do the exact opposite of what I ever have done before But it all turns out in to a major mess,Emotional Distress
I m too young and not well enough to have kids at the moment but it is something I truly want in the future But I am already starting to freak out a little What if having kids makes me become the psycho I currently am because it triggers some emotional response What if I can t deal with sharing the kids with my partner What if raising them becomes a huge disagreement because I can t compromise for whatever ridiculous reason I m scared I will become emotionally unstable again once I have kids What do I even do then I don t want to put a child through not having a good and stable mother I know what I NEED to do to be a good mother but I m afraid the irrational thinking could get the upper hand My dream is having a family of my own with the person I love I don t want BPD to fuck that up,Emotional Distress

Does anyone else get super upset when a friend declines doing a favour for you or does something that you would never ever do to them I ve come to realize that most of my splitting issues emerge from something like this where a friend declines giving me a lift to a party or giving me a piece of their food lol because I wouldn t hesitate to do that and much more for them I have come to the conclusion that I will always care about people far and above how much they will care for me,Emotional Distress

Dear all I have been with my lovely guy for twelve months now I love him Really I never yell at him I barely even get angry at him I save all such emotions for people who deserve them However I am increasingly afraid that my brain problems will kill my relationship In fact I feel downright guilty What if I blow up What if he sees me for what I am What if I hurt him inadvertently He wants to have children what if I freak out I have tons of issues re children due to my own childhood trauma What if I succumb to my fear and run away Or what if he throws me away What if he says Screw you I ll find a normal girl who can give me children What if I do get pregnant and go insane with PPD I feel like I am a plague and I will ruin everything Sometimes I feel like I should stay away from him for his own good Is this what I get for dating a nice guy Should I have stuck to my own angry artsy crowd Or am I generally unworthy Help,Emotional Distress

What about us What about the people who actually have to cope with BPD all the damn time because we are the ones who have BPD Note I think it is absolutely critical to have resources about BPD for those who don t have it themselves to help them better understand those who do have it But having been diagnosed with BPD within the past year when I turned to the internet to find resources about managing my BPD I was met with tons of information that demonized people who have BPD and reading it feels like I m being scolded and talked about while I m standing in the same room but being ignored Does anyone else feel this way Besides this subreddit I ve yet to find some reliable sources of good information and support for people who have BPD I gave up looking,Emotional Distress

I was wondering what you guys think of this image I made on what I m calling the Borderline Cycle of Fear http imgur com ixnGj5z http imgur com ixnGj5z I think it captures fairly well the cyclical nature of our fear based outbursts or at least the ones that I experience and those that I watched my father put us through for the first 20 years of my life Setting aside the fact that it leaves out some specific situations what do you think about it as a simple representation of the negative feedback loop caused by deep seated abandonment fears,Emotional Distress
I m obsessed with getting engaged I bring it up almost every day hinting that I d like a ring openly looking at rings teasing my boyfriend about how if he waits too long I might turn into a pumpkin I know it drives him nuts and it makes me feel bad to constantly make him feel like that I just can t stop thinking about it He made the point that if my concern is him leaving getting engaged isn t going to change anything he could still leave if we were engaged That s not it though He says he wants to spend the rest of his life with me Those are just words I ve gotten words before I want him to commit to that in front of family and friends I want people to know we want to spend the rest of our lives together I feel like that commitment and the involvement of outside parties who are aware of our engagement will help me believe that someone can want to spend their life with me Or something like that I just need more than words and right now that s all I m getting Ok now I have that more than words song stuck in my head He used to get me small gifts and things that made me feel special for our monthly anniversaries but since our 1 year passed that s kind of stopped He still buys me things necessities etc but little surprise gifts have stopped If you re familiar with the Love Languages mine is a three way tie with one of them being receiving gifts He s GREAT at fulfilling my other needs quality time and words of affirmation I want to spend the rest of my life with him I just wish I could take his words at face value when he says he wants to spend his with me I ve just been burned so many times my heart is unwilling to accept promises of eternal love without proof to back it up,Emotional Distress

I found a recent comment that spoke to and intrigued me I didn t know it until my therapist pointed out to me that I don t live in reality I haven t read much about it but BPD basically makes it so we can t rationalize our inside emotions and thoughts with the outside world going on it s a failure of reality testing source https www reddit com r BPD comments 3eu9fw unable_to_live_in_the_present_is_anyone_else_like ctiikr2 u freshstrawberrie I was wondering if anyone had any information on or experience with this I know that it makes sense for me especially in context of projecting my paranoid fears onto my girlfriend and interpreting her every action through the lens of impending abandonment,Emotional Distress
I do this every couple of months it seems like Sometimes there s a trigger but other times I just make the decision to never want to talk to them again They re great friends as well I don t know why I do this I don t even want to be friends with them anymore but I know in like two or three weeks I ll probably want them back They re great people and never intentionally try and harm me or anything either so I have no reason not to want to be friends with them Edit I also deactivated my Facebook and Twitter and stuff by the way It s almost like I enjoy the feeling of things falling apart Also I broke up with my girlfriend a week or two ago and basically just told her how horrible and manipulative I am I just told her that she can do better and stuff I don t understand why I m like this,Emotional Distress
I may or may not have BPD but I sure do have a lot of the symptoms and engage in similar behaviors My father also has those symptoms and it s pretty much left him an empty shell of a man with no friends and just my mom for support I have hurt or distance myself from a lot of people Mainly women I have dated Not even deep and long relationships Women I was just sleeping with regularly I have hurt and are no longer on speaking terms with Of the long term relationships I have been in they usually start wonderful and just slowly move into hateful frustrating madness I don t know how to fix myself and what I should be doing I have read about BPD often and I don t even know where to start with treatment I just don t want to end up like my dad And also I very much want to set things right with the people who I have hurt I want them to know I m sorry and maybe give us both closure My main frustration with BPD and myself is that often I don t feel especially irrational or emotional and instead feel like I need to be assertive about how other people are treating me It s hard for me to believe that feeling is always wrong or bad Can anyone give me any advice about this Sorry if it s rambling and incoherent,Emotional Distress
He basically left about a week ago for work related things and the only way of contact for us was through email I was sad and missed him but otherwise I was good I stopped checking this site I started to get fit It was going great Except now he s back and I feel like an awful human being for saying this and I wish he wasn t He got back said he was going to eat take a nap and then we can face time It was perfect since I was out doing stuff and I wouldn t be back till 9 But an hour later he tells me he s going to bed early because he s tired he s done this more than a handful times tells me he s going to take a nap so we can talk longer and then he changes his mind I got really annoyed and mad Had to rush home so I can do a couple of things before we can face time and basically i just feel like I was better off with him away Now I m back to checking his social networks every 5 minutes stalking and now doubting us Basically why isn t he texting me kinda thing At least when he was away I didn t have to worry about him cheating on me Not that he has but I just always get scared that he might or that he s taking to people behind my back I love him so much but now he s back for a week and a half and I should be so happy but I m miserable And I m annoyed And I m back to square one,Emotional Distress
This may or may not be a symptom of BPD I ll happily admit to being my own brand of weird P But I ve been doing a lot of self reflection lately and trying to name thoughts to emotions or sensations One thing I realised is that I live very heavily in the future and this may be what causes my desperation at the end of relationships Basically I tie my future to a romantic partner And obviously a large part of my past aka the relationship is about them When they leave me I m suspended in a vulnerable present and that terrifies me Does anyone else feel this way or can name it to a symptom I sort of like being able to logically understand my BPD,Emotional Distress
I need some perspective hence why I m writing this post About a year ago my boyfriend of 6 years has asked me to help him understand his emotions so I did He didn t understand the emotions he had for my younger sister he was basically emotionally attracted to her Hearig that has completely destroyed me I stayed with him since I thought to myself that he will never ever in a million years pursue or act on those emotions I hoped that whatever emotional attraction he felt will disappear since he is not indulging or pursuing it For the past year I had suspicion that his emotional attraction towards my sister has not actually disappeared and I was right Today he told me that on some level he is still emotionally attracted to her but he says it is meaningless as what he has with me its what he values I can understand what he says but I cannot live and be with him knowing what I know I feel so betrayed and heartbroken I know people can t help feelings but I m too hurt Any perspective,Emotional Distress
I am 23 y o male who has BPD and three other diagnosis They recently after having been diagnosed for 6 years determined I was born with BPD Anyway I recently got what I have been aiming at for the longest time a girlfriend We ve been going on just at the two week mark She likes me I like her I knew my disorders would eventually be an issue so I straight up told her about all four She didn t care and said if we get further down the road we can learn about how to handle the disorders together Well she went to a national convention over this weekend for her sorority I did exactly what other people said BPD persons so and I panicked and sent her 5 texts rapidly the last included a cutting phrase I literally threw up after I realized I said it And she replied later saying it hurt be she forgave me and ask me to be patient with her And I have been and it is easier now to not panic But the problem lays in that I see horror stories of people dating others with BPD Not having it themselves And the things they say they do scare me death I am terrified of doing any of that stuff I finally get the girl fucking hell I don t want to hurt her I had the moment already she forgave me and waits for me to calm down and is gentle on retorts But I don t want her to change for me I like her for her I want myself to work around her not the opposite I fear having others need to change anything to be near or work with me So far we ve bee good together and she is nice to me and I don t want her to ever regret having met me or the such With all this I m wondering if I even can have a normal stable loving relationship with anyone After all those stories I feel like some monster that will just hurt and torment everyone And what bothers me is everyone I ask for help minimizes my concerns or don t believe me thinking it is some delusion or whatever I don t expect any real help I just need to vent and get my fears somewhere that hopefully I can get the one person who can really help,Emotional Distress
I was diagnosed with BPD when I was 19 I m 24 now I used to be really really depressed back then Could not get out of bed wouldn t shower for days drinking a bottle of vodka every day unprotected sex with random people etc I attemped suicide and was in a hospital for a while then when I got out I was on a couple anti depressants mood stabilizers and an anti psychotic It made me a complete zombie I could not form sentences or have independent thought I lost a lot of my friends because they thought I was doing heroin and they were tired of my shit Of course they didn t tell me until afterwards that was why they stopped talking to me so I didn t have a chance to explain it was the meds Anyway I went off all meds on my own after about six months I still struggled with some depression but it was manageable and for the most part my life has continued to improve the last four years I ve cut back on drinking a lot I no longer self harm and have been able to hold down a job since 2012 These past few months though it just keeps getting worse I am losing all motivation an find myself sobbing for no reason more and more frequently I have changed my diet and started exercising but it has not really helped I have not felt this bad in a long time and I m scared that I m going to go back to the way I was Basically I am trying to find out what you guys have found that works I m not sure if I want to be on meds again because I m terrified of them after my bad experience I realize some are better than others though I was on abilify and resperdol sp and I can t remember the other two meds I am also scared to go to the doctor because I still have a lot of debt from my hospitalizations I feel like when I m honest with them they put me in psych against my will and then I m stuck with the bill My credit is just now starting to improve after I ve paid off a few bills Thoughts Advice,Emotional Distress
for a bit of back story i ve tried different drugs and never got addicted including LSD and DXM i used to drink kind of heavily but was never addicted to it i could put it down and not feel withdrawal i vape pretty heavily on 16mg nicotine and i ve not got addicted to it despite doing it near constantly sometimes but my weakness gambling i come in to work with my girlfriend everyday i wont disclose why you dont need to know and in one of the malls there is a Namco Funscape Arcade i have been there 3 or 4 days in a row and i love it i can t stop talking about it and i ve even looked up tactics to help me win at the machines i know which machines give the most tickets and have developed tactics i come back to my girlfriend works and sort the tickets i ve earned into piles of 10 x 3 tickets and add them up yesterday and today i used 24 and 30 cents on machines and got 622 tickets me and my girlfriend have more tickets at home i need to sort through from when we ve gone together too earlier before i went i was sat at a coffee table and feeling sorry for myself i felt depressed anxious on edge etc then my girlfriend sat down with me and i couldnt stop talking about namco and winning on machines and how i know how to get the most tickets and my favourite things to do my girlfriend told me to just get up and go to namco otherwise i wont shut up about it and i denied it saying i will i just dont know what else to talk about then i got my money out and counted it and eventually just said im gonna go to namco or i wont shut up about it i mean i dont get addicted to things easily i don t see the point in being addicted if you know what i mean i think it s willpower just i can put down this alcohol when i want to and i will resist it sometimes i get strong cravings to get drunk or high but it usually amounts to nothing gambling no i have to go gamble and i have to do it NOW im also not talking slot machines i m talking ball drops grab machines coin dozers etc touched a slot machine yesterday and it was the worst thing in the entire arcade haha i m 18 so i could go in to the adult area and do the proper gambling machines but my anxiety around others mainly men is too strong for that I m sorry by this point i m just rambling i m grambling but i kind of wanted more people to know ive finally found my addiction im really not happy about it and super self aware which i guess is good and im trying to limit myself to 10 a time i go so i m not spending too much only going when my girlfriend says it s okay to go because it is basically her money im using hence im being reasonable if it was my own i d spend hundreds and hundreds there again sorry for rambling but i kind of need to get my self awareness off my chest it s weird because i know im addicted to it but on the other hand i think nah im not addicted im just being childish and petty and i want to have fun no no i am addicted and i need to accept it and sort it,Emotional Distress
I haven t worked for two years I quit my last job as a travel assistant for disabled young people because one morning I lost my wallet and I was late and I broke down enough to quit I was having a tough period during that time as I was on antidepressants which sent my anxiety crazy Two years later I m still unemployed I live with my boyfriend and get disability I need to get a job now because I m somewhat dependent on my SO although we get a huge discount on rent due to my disability support and low income and I need to be able to support myself Plus I feel that staying at home bored has made my bpd a hundred times worse Problem is that I don t know what to do I screwed up my education high school drop out I can t think about a career now because I just need to work But I don t know WHAT I can do that doesn t require qualifications I am on disability so I am only looking for part time work I can t do retail because every time I ve done it in the past I get overwhelmed with the idea that all my colleagues hate me It is also so repetitive that it allows my mind to attack itself for the entire shift with self criticism I read that book Buddha and the BPD and she mentions recovery jobs jobs that allow mentally ill people to get back on their feet in a non overwhelming way Does anyone have any ideas as to what I can do,Emotional Distress
I ve been bouncing between PHP and IOP and now back to PHP in my hospital program My life is spiraling downward I recently got the BPD diagnosis and it s kind of life changing My boyfriend is iffy about helping me right now and my girlfriend is trying to help me but can only do so much and she s taking the brunt of my crazy mood swings and attacks They wanted me to go inpatient but at the hospital they assessed me and said I don t need inpatient I just need to go back up to PHP but that they agree with the psychiatric nurse that I definitely need to go to the DBT clinic and do their program as soon as I can once I m done with this program This hospital doesn t specialize in BPD or ED issues either so it s a good bonus going to the DBT clinic next but I m looking at waiting 6 8 weeks possibly I obviously cannot shut off my problems and while my current program is helping I feel like it isn t quite helping enough The psychiatric nurse said most people will not help me with BPD Is there anything at all I can do are there any resources at all to help me from like home or something until I can get into the DBT clinic My life is spiraling so far out of control and I m desperate for help,Emotional Distress
I have BPD and it feels like I try or wish to discard every part of my identity Gender race interests friends politics everything I don t even know what the hell I am without others telling me yet I manage to try and discard every single piece of identity I become aware of When I can t get rid of it it becomes highly distressing I want to know that I m not totally alone,Emotional Distress

Porn It s everywhere Hell at my job I come across porn I do search engine optimization My fiance looks at it and I generally don t have an issue with it Personally I can t stand it unless it s REALLY out there and that s just the curious cat in me But today like 5 minutes ago I caught my fiance on r Rule34 and got this huge wave of insecurity Most of the subreddits he s subscribed to are porn I got the feeling he d much rather look at other naked people than me even though we ve started sleeping naked every night How in the everloving hell can I curb these insecurity feelings Like I said I couldn t care less if he looks at porn I know he would never stray either I have no worries of him leaving me I just feel like my nakedness isn t good enough for him,Emotional Distress
EXPOSED My name is Kieran James Davidson At the age of 18 I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder I Äôm obsessive by nature and my thoughts consume every second of my day Just like time they never stop A chemical cocktail is the most important meal of the day for me With this I find passable relief My emotions are much like spinning a prize wheel random and unpredictable Like a child playing with a light switch they flicker from one state to the next They vary from a state of manic excitement to crippling depression The physical scars aren t nearly as traumatic as the mental ones Each one is a lesson but unfortunately I m a slow learner So I sit through the lectures and learn the best I can even if I fail the class a few times The main feelings I experience on a day to day basis are ANGER ANXIETY MANIC DEPRESSIVE and IDENTITY CONFUSION With great relief I Äôd finally like to share my story ANGER Let Äôs talk about ANGER Unfortunately this doesn Äôt creep into me but rather shoots into me like heroin and overwhelms me even before the tourniquet is off It Äôs as if several pin balls have fired inside my chest all at once but they never seem to find an opening an escape Every thought is another ball adding to the chaotic mess With no instant relief in sight I can only scream within until I tire myself out much like an infant during a tantrum Gasping for breath and sanity I lay down I Äôve successfully endured another episode without bloodshed My muscles loosen and my heart goes back to its normal pace such a relief but for how long I can flare up in mere seconds and it feels as though I could set a fire under water That being said the raging fire can also be snuffed out by a gentle breeze So I Äôm just going to enjoy this brief moment of inner neutrality ANXIETY What Äôs beyond my bedroom blinds Was that a sound Who was that Did they say my name If they did are they coming for me Better turn off the lights and lock all my doors Fuck I m pacing Maybe it Äôs just my ANXIETY again This feeling stops me from exploring beyond my bedroom door taking on new responsibilities or simply answering my phone My hands start to sweat my eyes scan the room at a rapid pace and my breathing is even faster When will this end Oh fuck It Äôs not going to isn t it I had better take an Ativan Ahhhh It Äôs much better now Hopefully someday I can have more control over these random attacks that leave me in a confused state There Äôs nothing to be scared of yet I can find the ugliness inside of little Shirley Cue or Mother Teresa My paranoia ruins my current relationships and stops me from creating new ones I am fully in the shadow of my own wall only now clawing and digging to find a speck of light instead of bathing in it MANIC If you want to know the definition of impulsiveness just watch someone get triggered into a MANIC state It Äôs like a shot of adrenaline being delivered at a lethal dose It Äôs actually one of the most enjoyable states I experience yet it Äôs the most damaging During times of mania I m more prone so substance use unsafe sexual encounters and other Äúrisky Äù behaviours I feel invincible that Äôs why I say that it Äôs the most damaging Fear doesn t seem to be present at all A game of Russian roulette or human Frogger seems like a good idea doesn t it It Äôs during this state that I Äôm the most productive taking on multiple projects at once The creative juices are flowing and so is productivity You can see the double edge blade situation forming here can Äôt you Now if I could only fight the bad impulses and indulge in the productivity part of it then I could accomplish a lot more than I do DEPRESSIVE My eyes barely open as the sun signals a new day There is much time before I must ready myself for my later engagements and lots of time for productive matters Yet I Äôm fascinated by the ceiling above me Moving a finger at this point seems like a difficult task With yesterday Äôs promise I shone so bright but triggered once again everything seems so out of sight Yep pretty sure this is the DEPRESSIVE state I stop practicing my passions I throw away my goals I whimper and whine for no good reason It Äôs just one of my turns is all I have a great idea Äì ÄúWhy don Äôt I push away all those people who support me Äù Not letting anyone in and turning inward is always the best option right To quote ÄòAmerican Psycho Äôs Patrick Bateman ÄúBecause I want to fit in Äù It Äôs a defining line in the film as he tries to hide his psychopathic tendencies to the world so he can continue to live the lifestyle he s so clearly obsessed with If my inward thoughts became outward actions I fear that none of my peers would want to be within a 10 foot radius of me It seems that these obsessive thoughts come in many forms and vary from state to state The thing I dislike the most about this one is the lack of energy much like I ve been robbed of the essential nutrients I need to survive It Äôs not the case but most likely an unbalanced chemical somewhere up there This is usually followed by emptiness but that Äôs another branch on the tree maybe something is wrong with the soil IDENTITY CONFUSION Since I was a child I struggled with my identity struggling to find out who I was I know most young people have this issue but I coped with mine in much more dramatic ways whether it was drastic changes in fashion hobbies peer groups a name change or sexual experimentation The search for an identity often made me a target of public criticism especially in my high school years It wasn t until recently that I Äôve discovered who I am and accept it For a long time I was ashamed of who I was and how I felt I am now proud to admit that I am a gender fluid male It Äôs a term that when I discovered it it finally made all my feelings make sense It doesn t affect my sexual preference which is heterosexual it just means that more often than not I identify myself as a female I carry almost all of the characteristics of being one without having the physical attributes I Äôve always had a closeness with females and I find myself relating with them so much more When it comes to males I often find myself threatened which creates a trigger for anxiety and anger The reason for this is unclear at this time but it Äôs something I Äôll have to resolve if I want more male friendships which at the present are few and far between Well that Äôs it This is the dizzying array of symptoms that I feel on a weekly or sometimes daily basis The point of all of this isn t to put attention solely on myself but for mental illness as a whole No matter what the diagnosis is the suffering is quite real There have been strides made in the way people view mental illness but there Äôs still a long way to go I find a lot of people have a bastardized opinion on the matter with no significant education to back it up If I m told that I can Äútalk myself out of it Äù one more time it might induce a manic fit but then I may ruin my initial purpose of writing this I have spent years hiding who I really am so I can fit a social standard that I can Äôt compete with I Äôm done being ashamed of an illness I didn t ask for If I can change just one persons opinion on this matter then it will give me great gratification and hopefully spark other people to EXPOSE themselves too,Emotional Distress
so i recently moved in with my gf who i suspect may have bpd tbh i m not really sure where to start with all this nor do i know what i m looking for but here it goes we recently moved in together and i m not sure if apprehension came from the fact that this is the most serious relationship i ve been in or if i noticed signs of something being off lately we ve been fighting over really mundane things all hell breaks loose over spilled milk and often i m left wondering where any of this is coming from sorry if this all seems really vague i m trying to express as much without disclosing too many specifics she has a talent for hitting nerves when she s upset literally attacking my very character in that specific moment i m often left wondering if i should stay or go but any choice i make i encounter opposition i ve told her i love you and nothing means more to me than your happiness so if my leaving will make you happy i ll go to which she ll reply fine go don t work on this if you leave never come back etc i feel stuck and just to clarify we do have good days and they re awesome but they are becoming few and far between,Emotional Distress

Every time I start to befriend someone it s great Then as things go on and we get a little closer I will eventually feel comfortable sharing some more personal stuff And then they see who I really am and it drives them off I m no longer a cheerful person I m pretty damn sad actually And then contact will draw to an end and be near non existent within a month or two It has happened multiple times Now I no longer see the point of even trying to befriend people I don t know I guess I m just curious to know if anyone else experience the same,Emotional Distress

I don t know where to post or talk about this but since psychiatrist feels that bpd is the most suited label for some of my thinking patterns maybe people know the feeling here Depressive throwaway account though But yeah I feel lost I don t know where to aim my energy I don t have a coherent direction in life I have just to many identity problems occasionally not knowing what I want or what I m really like I feel like a failure Also my network is pretty much just my bf but I can t live like that The lack of hanging out and being included with a circle of friends is putting a heavy cloud on my life I don t even know why I should even bother trying anymore since it seems like I can t apparently keep friends or make new ones I haven t seen any friends in what already feels like a very long time How can I keep trying if I don t have network of support my therapy ended too just recently and can t afford to continue it How do people get friends again when people seem to think they have a personality of a mouse and are already almost in their mid twenties Share your wisdom people How to make friends,Emotional Distress

I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy Because they know what its like to feel absolutely worthless and they don t want anybody else to feel like that Robin Williams That spoke to me so I took all the stress from the past few days and sat down with it and finally took the first steps into starting my youtube channel And posted the first video yesterday and I promoted myself on Facebook Skype Reddit and then started to get some views But before I added skype and reddit I had done facebook And I think I had gotten a few dislikes from facebook friends But the thing was I only sent a few people I acutally cared about the link to watch it Bc I set the video to unlisted And about 2 3 people disliked it and that bothered me That someone I kinda feel okay with would dislike a video I really tried to put my all into I had also posted it on a the smite subreddit and got a few nice comments there But then on youtube I only had more dislikes than likes So yeah then I got high Bc Im emotionally weak and wanted to feel awesome and then all this started bothering me So then I wanted to post to here if you guys would check out my video and maybe see it s decent and help balance out the likes and dislikes https www youtube com watch v TAbCDlX60Yk,Emotional Distress
Hello all I was recently off work for 9 weeks and have been back at work for 4 weeks now I learned a lot about myself in the past year since my BPD diagnosis and have been working really hard at getting better But more and more now since my return to work I have been feeling drained I get so anxious so easily and I react to so many little things throughtout the day While I may now have a few new ways to talk myself through all those tiny little things I still have to talk myself through them And I think that s where the tiredness comes from Regular days were hard enough as they were I thought I was already giving it my all but now I have to be even better Sometimes though I never would and I hardly entertain the idea it s just a passing thought sometimes I feel like just giving up Let myself have the breakdown I feel I m on the edge of Partly because I don t feel I have the energy to keep going but partly because I want people to see that I m not suddenly magically better because I had 9 weeks off that I don t now have all my shit in order and am ready to take on whatever the world throws at me I am still fragile and every hour of every day is a battle for me When I m at work I want to be a good employee when I m at home I want to be a good wife I m trying my hardest to keep on improving Just the other day I applied for another job since I know my current admin assistant position is just sucking the life out of me but just that was like a huge win for me So how the heck do you go through life when small things like writing up a cover letter is such a big hurdle I know I have to keep fighting keep trying I just don t know how much longer I ll be able to keep going And I feel so scared of having another meltdown that would lead to me being off work again because finances are something that cause my husband a lot of stress and I when I was off previously he was super stressed and ever since I have been back he keeps making comments like now that you re back to work and getting paid your full salary we ll get back on our feet and giving me happy little pats on the leg when he says that He doesn t realize when he says things like that it makes me panic I know I should just calmly let him know but even just sharing my feelings is difficult Figuring out my feelings and then figuring out a way to communicate them a nd figuring out a way to make sure I m not projecting on him or adding any pressure on him all of that takes effort and I don t always have the insight to do it on the spot But then if I consider bringing them up later I don t know how to It s like the words just get jammed on the way out and never get uttered and I just keep going like everything is normal even though on the inside I feel completely overwhelmed Everything is scary And everything hurts And I just want to give up Sorry for the rant And sincere thanks for reading,Emotional Distress
I ve been doing the same line of work for five years and it feels like an eternity I ve applied for new jobs but it s not easy when I don t know if I d like the job enough I don t even know if I can really cope with work right now and my job isn t that stressful I don t want to take sick leave again I was off for 5 months last year I cannot afford it and I wouldn t qualify for any benefits Money is such a problem I m skint almost all the time Our rent is pretty extortionate but we can t move out just yet for space reasons Sorry I m just venting Too much is happening Grandpa just died things aren t the same Dad gets married on Friday playing happy families with him when he was a bad father when I was younger is just too much I don t want to go but I have to for my little brother I can t talk to him about it last time I tried to speak to him he turned his back and walked away I m bitter as fuck and I just can t let go This shit is too much I want to say fuck it and walk away,Emotional Distress
I feel really uncomfortable whenever someone compliments me especially if it s from a potential love interest I also lose interest in anyone that actively pursues me in a romantic fashion even if I was once attracted to them Why do I do this I used to have a big crush on this one guy we ve been friends for about two years now I think He s always been really nice and caring toward me but for some reason I don t find him appealing now that he wants me And whenever he calls me beautiful pretty etc I just feel uneasy and like he s lying to me How do I correct this thought process I feel like I am self sabotaging I used to really like this guy and I think I should give him a chance because at this point I don t really trust my internal monologue anymore my mind is saying no there s clearly something wrong with him if he likes you don t go out with him but I say that about almost every guy,Emotional Distress
I can fully rationalise that it s normal for him to be moody just like it s normal for me to be moody but any time he s outwardly moody almost never toward me just at like our pets for being naughty or something I don t know if it s my BPD or my PTSD for a fun mixture of both things I just feel like I immediately go into defense mode I get all anxious and short tempered because I guess I m bracing for verbal or physical abuse that he s never once caused me but has been what I ve grown up knowing to expect from parents This sucks obviously but is usually an internal struggle and something I ve learned to get through without affecting others negatively However my husband is also a fan of telling me improvements for how I do things or why something I m doing won t work out properly Like telling me how to cook better even though we re in agreeance that I m the better cook telling me that the methods I m using to secure a blockage to keep our ferret out of dark holes have ways for the ferret to get past etc It s just the smallest stuff and sometimes it only slightly annoys me I know I m hypersensitive to criticism and am being unfair and unreasonable no need to latch onto reminding me of that too much but when it s combined with me already being in alert mode because he s been moody I take this stuff as a complete attack I can recognise that I m projecting my past from my mom legitimately verbally attacking me to destress herself that I m holding onto a past survival mechanism to defend and avoid but I can t seem to get myself to stop reacting in such ways Does anyone else have any skills that hell them deal with hyper sensitivity to percieving things as a personal attack How can I stop feeling so drastically scared of my husband s dissapproval upset Ex he s been moody for hours now over the ferret situation and I was trying to help a bit because he won t stop stressing about it and he s just immediately come over and shoved the board over telling me what I ve done hasn t helped at all and I just snapped fuck me for trying then and immediately locked myself in our room I don t like being so sensitive and reactive and I hate that my way of dealing with anything I feel is a personal attack is to respond with anger I hate that my slight annoyances turn into me thinking I need to defend my entire worth as a human being,Emotional Distress

Well I posted a few threads about shutting out others going through depression I had a two month relationship with this girl who cut me out and it broke me down entirely During counseling today I realized how often I have been shutting people out of my life for years but I never acknowledged it I d hang out with them once or twice but then I d shut them out I would even think of reasons to not like them and it made me feel horrible but I couldn t help it That this reason would justify me not letting them get close or form a relationship I hate it because I don t want to be alone forever but anytime someone tries to get close the thoughts come up again I have no idea if this is my answer but for once I don t feel like I am completely insane and a terrible human being I regret those I have hurt by shutting them out letting them down or even now not wanting to talk to others going through this rough time Thank you for reading if anyone has advice or maybe could share their story it would mean so much it s been a tough Monday for sure,Emotional Distress
In the course of 3 days I found out my ex killed herself by swallowing fucking razors no less I got dumped by the girl I was in my first serious relationship with since the ex who killed herself and I just found out that my mom has been depressed my entire life and has attempted suicide twice within the passed 5 years I want to beg my dead ex to come back to life and I want to beg my new ex to come back to me I want her to ask to call me Not even to ask to have me back necessarily though I can t deny that most of me wants that more than anything I just want to talk to her My body physically aches from the pain of all this shit I m ashamed of the fact that I m this fucked up right now I ve had breakups before and I ve had friends die before but this is too much This fuck you of a mental disorder makes it so much more painful Someone please tell me what to do I m struggling here,Emotional Distress
Last night I had a small fit over nothing and laid in bed with a blanket over my head for thirty minutes He gave me some space for a bit and came over when I reached for him from the bed He sat next to me and held my hand and rubbed my hair and listened to me blubber about how it s hard for me to understand what I m feeling and how to express it He tells me he believes me when I tell him I don t want to feel this way and he tells me I shouldn t be frustrated with myself if I m not making the progress I feel like I should be and that very well adjusted for a borderline I feel like he s too good for me He deserves someone better or at least someone who fits to him better than I do I feel like I m never going to go anywhere from here and I don t want him to get stuck with or resent me,Emotional Distress
I myself have been diagnosed with depression and borderline personality traits Basically I have symptoms of BPD but not enough to fit the criteria for a full diagnosis I don t have mood swings or trouble controlling my emotions but I am absolutely paranoid when it comes to abandonment or really the loss of any relationship even if I didn t like the person I rarely get into relationships but when I do I m obsessed and bend to their every need I wound up in an abusive relationship because of this and I think that experience may have aggravated the symptoms that I have I dated this guy who told me very early on that I was his number one priority We moved really quickly in every way He completely idealized me and I really had no logical reason to fear losing him As things began to progress he would drop hints about wanting me to be his girlfriend and all that but he never asked me directly I took this to mean that he didn t really want to be with me So I would talk a lot about the guys that hit on me and stuff to make him see me as more valuable I guess Of course that just seems like I was purposefully trying to make him jealous when really I just wanted reassurance He had already made comments about me being out of his league appearance wise he wished I didn t dress so well because I looked too good for him and a couple times when we were out a guy would sometimes hit on me right in front of him in these situations I would always reject them immediately He asked me one day to stop talking to straight men and then he suggested I quit my job to spend more time with him Coming from a previous abusive relationship I didn t think to interpret his comments as a need for reassurance So instead of talking about it I just shut him down and said yeah that s not going to happen The next day he broke up with me He said he felt empty I tried to stay cool and handled the talk pretty well Now we have a college class together and I m getting signals that he is interested in me Once when I walked into class his face immediately turned red and he looked down I don t know if he would ever reach out to me I think he is too insecure He was bullied severely as a kid and I would expect that anticipating social rejection is much more stressful for him than the average person But I really miss him I liked him a lot At the same time I don t know if I m just idealizing him But for the most part I want him back and I m not sure if that s a good idea He s an extremely kind and understanding person so I honestly do think we could make it work if we put in the effort So does anyone have any insight or advice on my situation Or any ideas as to how I can open communication between us again Thanks a lot,Emotional Distress
When you go back to the place of the crisis crises near it do you ever wonder whether people notice you from that time when you were having the crisis Do you ever wonder if people are talking about you I m trying to work on it but I find myself worrying about these things I was put under section 136 a few times because of my behaviour in public It sucks I don t want people pointing at me saying there s that crazy girl For those of you that don t know what section 136 is Section 136 gives the police the power to remove a person from a public place when they appear to be suffering from a mental disorder to a place of safety The person will be deemed by the police to be in immediate need of care and control as their behaviour is of concern,Emotional Distress
My ex left me almost two months ago because he didn t have the patience to deal with my BPD I m still not over it as I d been in love with him for quite a long time And now I m having an issue My mind keeps trying to attach to people And it lasts for all of maybe A day tops And them I already want to throw them out because every perception is not what my brain wanted it to be It tries and then immediately rejects it And goes into the opposite where I don t want to deal with them It ll idealize somebody And then almost immediately after everything about them is wrong nothing my mind wants on a pedestal Maybe my abandonment issues have escalated so much they re immediately pushed off because think know it will happen and I now have attachment issues Maybe it s because subconsciously I am still thinking about him and pushing away anybody who isn t him I m not sure But it s never happened quite like this before and I m confused I start therapy for the first time next week or so Hopefully that will help clear some of it up But in the meantime I m at a loss for explanation,Emotional Distress
My new coworkers constantly criticize my ideas even though it s not their place to do so as my immediate manager likes what I do but he gets frustrated when the group says what I did or am suggesting is bad and he starts questioning whether my excellent in his opinion ideas apply in that specific situation The coworkers just try to get me do things their way because they think they know better than me despite not having any education in the field and they demand that I defend all my ideas and explain every background rationale behind the ideas in order to put a stamp of approval on it even though it s not in their job description to do so but my immediate manager doesn t want them to be frustrated by not having any say in the situation that they dislike And when I try to defend my ideas they won t listen interrupt me ignorantly challenge scientifically proven facts and won t trust me on my word and demand me to show them respective research How should I handle this,Emotional Distress
Since I was a small child I have always been dramatic very moody and an over reactive person I have a lot of good qualities but an equal number of qualities that make me a pretty shitty human being On one hand I am an enthusiastic friend open honest and genuine I m pretty smart fun and fairly engaging I give a shit about the world and I am using my career to try to make a difference in people s lives and the world a better place But It doesn t take much or really any thought for me to hurt people s feelings my friend the other night said You use a lot of sarcasm sometimes in a bitchy humor way and I can see easily how you could really hurt someone with your words if they were to cross you I can be selfish and self absorbed brutally honest emotionally reactive and judgmental As much as I try to compensate and work on my behavior I am left feeling as though no matter how hard I try how much therapy I am in how much I challenge myself and how much of a do gooder I try to be inherently I m a bad person and people inevitably see this and leave me Anyone else feel that way,Emotional Distress
Hi I haven t been diagnosed yet and just started therapy Thursday and mood stabilizers a couple weeks ago I don t know if I m still allowed to post on here but this is a great community and I feel pretty alone so why not I guess I ve just been stuck with these obsessive thoughts that everyone actually dislikes me and there s nothing I can do about it Today two people I talk to hit me up to do hair makeup for a wedding I thought it might be to hang out but it s never to hang out I jokingly said to my fianc I m glad I can perform services or else no one might talk to me On top of that he spent almost all day at his friends house so that just makes me feel like he hates spending time with me too Not that I can blame anyone for that I drink too much and am kind of bitchy I wouldn t want to hang out with me either but unfortunately I m kind of stuck Then another person who I used to hang out with hit me up the other day Thought it might be to say what s up but it was just for advice on what kind of new vape shit to get then the conversation ended as soon as I answered I do have a really good friend but she lives about 20 minutes away and we both have pretty busy schedules so that kind of sucks I seriously just want to never leave my house except to go to work and just withdraw because clearly people just want to hang out because I m the one who supplies the alcohol or can do hair or makeup or because I m with the person I m with and they have to put up with me but then I get these intense feelings of loneliness and just want to be around people but then immediately regret it because all I can think about is if I didn t do x no one would give a fuck if I was here or not I don t know I guess I just wanted to vent a little bit I could talk to my fianc about it but he wouldn t care and it would probably make him question why he was with me even more since I m a grown adult sounding like an insecure middle schooler I just want to disappear but I finally got a great job that I ve been at for like three months and there s no problems yet so at least I have that going for me Edit I m supposed to add flair Sorry Still trying to figure out how to work the app This is supposed to be venting,Emotional Distress

Hi all I m using a throwaway for this as my partner and others know my username I will try to keep this as short as possible it s all a little bit complicated and I could really do with some advice from others who have a diagnosis of BPD as I m completely lost right now I was diagnosed with BPD when I was 17 after having struggled with my mental health issues from the age of 10 It started with an eating disorder at the age of 10 I was self harming by 13 and by 16 I had tried to commit suicide When I was 17 I was in and out of a psych unit for a while including being put under section for 3 months and it was during this period that my doctors had apparently begun to question whether or not I had BPD It wasn t until about a year later when looking at where I should be transferred to within the adult services that I was told that they were considering adding BPD to my list of various diagnosis depression anxiety EDNOS dissociation disorder of some kind I had spent 5 years being pushed towards treatment for depression ED so when BPD was mentioned I was confused I was referred to the adult personality disorders service but at no point was my diagnosis explained to me Plenty of professionals told me what the symptoms and whatnot were but no one ever took the time to explain how they fitted in with my issues I took issue with this I couldn t understand how the list of factors that they had used to diagnose me fitted me EDNOS Depression Anxiety all of those labels I understood and I understood how they applied to me but not BPD and no one wanted to or could explain I was in desperate need of support at this point about to turn 19 and move to the adult services but the only treatment that I was being offered was a 6 month group therapy course for BPD This was the initial assessment group for longer term treatment It was the only support I was offered apart from a fortnightly appt with a psychiatric nurse and although she was truly wonderful it wasn t enough I was backed into a corner where I would have to spend an entire day per week talking and listening to strangers and doing art therapy or I would have to face my issues alone Without any kind of support at all I didn t feel that the treatment I was being offered was appropriate for me I kicked up such a fuss to the point where the therapists told me outright that they didn t think I would complete the course due to my refusal to accept the diagnosis I m a stubborn woman so I completed the 6 months of treatment as much to say FUCK YOU to the therapists as anything for my benefit It didn t help and I moved away to start university in the same vulnerable state I had been in for years I ll sum my uni experience up as quickly as possible Year 1 drugs sex alcohol psych ward drugs alcohol sex Year 2 Alcohol drugs sex alcohol rape suicide attempt respite centre for the suicidal dropped out After dropping out it took me a while to get level but I did and up until about 2 3 months ago I was in the best mental health that I have ever been For almost a year I felt as close to normal as I ever have Other than the occasional spell of anxiety things were great I met the most incredible man who has become my whole world I ve been doing well career wise and I have been happy Like actually happy and stable in a way I had never thought possible I moved across the country with my partner about 2 months ago and over the past month ish I ve been feeling kinda crazy I have become absolutely terrified that he s going to leave me It may have something to do with the fact I can t have sex with him as much as either of us would like due to some physical health issues but I can feel myself starting to struggle more and more as time goes on and I m beginning to question whether or not the BPD diagnosis was actually right My partner has shown literally no signs of straying he s as affectionate and loving as ever yet I m going crazy thinking that he s cheating He s gone out with some of the guys from his work this evening and I ve sunk a bottle of wine in an hour I don t really drink anymore so that s quite a lot for me these days because I m terrified he s going to hook up with someone I spend the entire time he s out obsessing over it whether he s at work with friends or playing sport I m scared he s with someone else and is going to leave me When he s at home I m scared that every time he picks up his phone it s someone else or that he s thinking about someone else I ve struggled with the fear of abandonment in different relationships before friends family partners but never like this I guess what I m asking is does any of this kinda fit with what you recognise as BPD I don t know anyone with BPD to ask about this that I know of and I guess I just want to know I m not completely nuts or not I know you aren t doctors but you re people who get it Sort of Ish Thank you all in advance TLDR Diagnosed with BPD 7 years ago only now just starting to think I might have the condition due to recent unfounded paranoia about relationship Could really do with some help,Emotional Distress

I always find myself in this sort of morbid curiosity state that leads me to reading things like BPDSOFFA I know it s linked here but I m just venting my feelings and raisedbynarcissists reading snippets of How to Stop Walking on Eggshells etc When I do this it leads me into an inevitable state of guilt and shame and pushes me to give in to self isolation and reverting back to my tendency of bottling my emotions up until they explode It s counter intuitive really since the comments about how explosive and irrational we are about our emotions is what gets me so worked up to this point in the first place I have been trying so so hard in the last year or so to better manage my life and how I navigate my feelings and relationships but when I see people talking about how impossible I am because of this thing I suffer through every day it just makes me feel sort of hopeless I guess It s as if I become afraid to ever be open about being borderline because then people will view me as evil as someone they need to escape I feel like a monster like allowing people to interact with me is selfish and wrong But it s not like I even agree with people who say awful things about people with BPD I think that a lot of those ironically black and white statements about what and who we are often come from a place of anger and frustration toward their experiences with individuals that they re then in turn applying to all of us It s unfair it s hurtful it s often creeping toward emotionally abusive honestly I can remind myself that I disagree with these people that there are people in my life who don t see me that way and yet I still feel like maybe I ve just trapped everyone into dealing with me like the people I love are actually cowering inside because of how horrible I must be,Emotional Distress

When you re walking around people shout their conversations over constant defending noise trains thundering cars and trucks with brakes squeeling under misuse thundering diesel trucks buses heavy metal plates covering holes and construction that repeatedly BANG each time a car thunders over them Flashing lights people passing quickly bumping into you the constant battle of chicken who will give way a constant game of pecking order in a crowd Drowning under noise hunched against movement pushed under the pecking order the heat becomes unbearable You see a cafe ICE COLD You want silence from the noise You try all the twenty side doors along the street trying to not look frantic till you reach the corner where the entrance Air conditioner blasts cold Your order becomes a power play of how the cashier can feel superior to you and you re already bruised by the competition outside You just want a fucking iced tea You are barely coherent and the cashier is looking at you like you re stupid because you re too overwhelmed and tired and deaf to hear her low voice saying to go to the other side of the counter a mile away to pick up the tea The girl who makes your tea is baseline attitude closed off but smiles at you and you feel like someone threw you a floating right in the middle of open water The tables are all full no one looks you in the eye but huddles down defensively and protectively around their small bubbles of space or pretends you don t exist till you reach the back and find another room The room has a dark corner with table and chair It s relatively empty and quiet You beeline for the corner and relax for a few minutes You plan to stay to decompress and unwind perhaps an hour you ve got time The music comes on loud right over your ears and jolts you It s some unpleasant jangly mainstream pop crap that sets your teeth on edge You can stay in the cool noisy room or venture out into the heat noise and competition of constant zombie bodies There is no peace,Emotional Distress
I know that one of the struggles with having BPD is lying I have struggled with lying for a good part of my life not about major issues just little white lies I wouldn t want my parents to know I m smoking or I d steal my sisters shirt without asking and wear it then lie to her about it when she asks stuff like that I was in a wonderful relationship one I ve never been in before I wasn t a smoker but when I started to go through a relapse with my BPD I turned to smoking So I was embarrassed so I hid it from my boyfriend until he found cigarettes in my car I didn t try to hide it It was a struggle but we worked on the issue and I was able to quit smoking he bought me one of those eCigarettes and that seemed to do the trick I wasn t a major smoker or anything so it wasn t that hard One of our mutual friends I had had a very brief relationship with about 4 years prior to my relationship I hid that from my boyfriend as well until a couple of weeks ago someone told him about it When he found out he broke up with me and told me I had betrayed him and he would never trust me again I am devastated we still talk and he s thinking about things but I know it s over He won t give me a second chance Was what I did worthy of a breakup I know I m in the wrong and I have certainly learned my lesson but I don t know what to do Do I wait around for him to see if he changes his mind I am moving out this weekend and he s giving me a hand I m so hurt I just want him back,Emotional Distress
Hi I m just asking because I ve been in talk therapy on off with a therapist for 4 years and we recently stopped I don t feel that it was a worthwhile experience tbh talking about PTSD made the flashbacks stronger and I didn t feel a trusting connection with her It was just I would explain a feeling I had or something I did we would talk about it and nothing would change I just felt pressured to continue because in my familys eyes it would mean I was being proactive But honestly it didn t help anything Now they want me to start therapy again I really feel that talking about my life and feelings to a professional stranger hasn t helped me and starting again won t help me either but idk I can t really function as it is but there s no point doing something that won t help,Emotional Distress
The one time i tried talking to her about having Bpd she immediately said no i dont think you have it A lot of Borderlines i know tend to iniate things and you seem to react to a lot of things I cant remember exactly what she said forgive me it was months ago i never brought it up again because i didnt want to get shot down again I also mentioned it to my new Psychiatrist and he just ignored my comment and continued to talk about my depression I understand that theres a lot of stigma surrounded the disorder and that from what ive heard most professionals are hesitant to diagnose it but that doesnt mean that we cant just talk about whether or not i have it,Emotional Distress

So I ve always been a pretty timid fearful person I m terrified to death of the paranormal horror movies haunted houses etc are a big no no I once had a panic attack when I got pranked at school by some seniors who were dressed up as ghosts I don t do so well even watching thriller movies the jump scares and eerie music freak me out I have a pretty overactive imagination and I tend to wonder things like What if I turn around now and there s something behind me I have quite an intense fear of heights and I m also scared of insects All my life I ve simply assumed I m a wuss But given that BPD seems to be affected by the makeup of our amygdalas and limbic systems I was wondering if there might be a pattern Anyone else,Emotional Distress
My boyfriend s college best friend took his own life in June this year It was really sudden caught everyone off guard He was a person that wasn t very open with anyone about his problems always with a smile on his face he made everyone smile around him always joking always so happy I never met him btw but everyone who talked about him never seem to know why he did what he did Until I saw a text his older sister wrote on FB a kind of venting type of text and also a tribute It seemed that she was the person who knew him the best they were extremely close It seems that the reason he did it is because he was always so full of anger because of everything that goes on in the world hunger war corrupt politics just bad things in general He never thought anything would change and that s why he did it I never knew him but I cried for more than a week when I was told about his death even more after knowing why he d done it Maybe because I can relate to him so bad Even know I still think about it I can t get it off my mind it seems so unreal that he did it I feel so sad he was such a great person had his whole life ahead of him and I am so fucking angry that he did it that he can t live again that I couldn t meet him and talk to him talk him out of it I am so so angry I really am I just I can t even say anything anymore I am just so angry I wish I could ve done something or someone could I just I don t know It s so sad heartbreaking and infuriating I am so sorry for the long post but I needed to vent I can t talkto my boyfriend about this Not anymore I don t want to remind him about it ormake him sad angry,Emotional Distress
The group isn t really run the way it s supposed to be I don t think it s helping me at all I don t like the other people in the group I can t even work through my feelings with a private therapist so what makes people think I ll do that in a group I m not taking away any skills I don t know Maybe I m just not committed enough My therapist was really excited that I was starting this I just want to stop going Has anyone else tried DBT and didn t like it,Emotional Distress

I tend to enjoy music that reflects what I am dealing with It makes it easier for me to deal with it to hear it in some form of music Though I can t seem to find many songs that feel like they relate to BPD The only two I ve really found were this by Emilie Autumn I adore her https www youtube com watch v lXlF ykn3ZA and this https www youtube com watch v HjIs O3zjIY Perhaps some of you will enjoy it as well I m not certain Or perhaps you have music you d like to share Music is a wonderful medium for me Don t forget you re beautiful And you matter Have a good day lt 3 Edit I accidentally copied the wrong video link I copied the one that got the artist wrong on the second one Please note that Morissette is not the actual artist The actual artist is Merideth Brooks,Emotional Distress

I ve been diagnosed twice as bipolar but after this most recent hospitalization the doctor wanted to just diagnose me as having boderline personality disorder I feel like I identify more with bipolar emotions but I also see some overlap with boderline symptoms I m unsure as to what to think Anyone else gone through something similar this is somewhat traumatic because I ve also had trouble trusting my emotions and my bipolar diagnosis Overall I m extremely confused and scared,Emotional Distress
I ve been recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder after years of being told I was bipolar I was on several different medications for bipolar and they all made me worse so I ve decided I don t want to try medicine again I was curious as to how others cope with their thoughts and feelings I am usually okay and my SO has been trying to help but I still get dug into a depression hold that lasts for days,Emotional Distress
We are both girls and are at this point still sort of at the friend flirting stage For the most part despite us both having had unhealthy relationships in the recent past there hasn t been that much difficulty although currently she has been having a lot of difficulties I have been doing my best to try and help even if it is only a little bit I don t fully understand the situation which I actually don t mind at all Like not really knowing anything about BPD before meeting her I hadn t really given it much thought Like I don t really understand why but the thought that we might both have intense screwed up emotions actually is kind of comforting to me Like I feel safer around her than I do around most people Have I lost it,Emotional Distress

Apologies because I know this has been asked before but I can t find the thread I m mainly looking for opinions So over the past year or so I ve come to realise that I identify as gender non binary and may possibly even be trans ftm I also have a BPD diagnosis When I mentioned this to a mental health worker several months ago I was told that this is a symptom of BPD and I should not take it seriously I have also spoken to a friend whose father is a psychologist and agrees that it is a symptom although adds that it doesn t make it any less real Lately it s been taking up every layer of my conscious and subconscious mind My gender is definitely not female and never has been It s only in the past year that I have been looking into gender realised that it is different to sex and my gender is not the same as my sex I am finding that trying on neutral pronouns changed title to Mx after marriage asking very close friends to call me Hans they them wearing mens clothes and binding my chest eases some of my symptoms of BPD and is very comfortable But I m too scared to go to a doctor in case it gets written off as a symptom and not real It s only since a close friend told me that she has always known I was not female and said I had told her this when we were both young teenagers which I don t remember but I trust her that I have begun to trust that these feelings are more than just a symptom I m still scared to talk to a professional about it though I m also terrified of it causing my marriage to break down my husband knows about my gender struggles and is amazingly supportive but has also said that he doesn t think he would be attracted to me if I decide to transition and he would feel uncomfortable going out in public if I were attempting to present as male I don t hold it against him though as he is a straight man and I understand his meaning He wants to call me his wife and use she her I guess my question is are there any other people in a similar situation re their gender Do you think gender struggles and BPD are mutually exclusive And if anyone has spoken to their doctors about this how did you get on Thank you for reading,Emotional Distress
I m just tired of comparing myself all the time and coming up short He s extremely quiet about any women he works with Had to get him off snapchat once before because some bimbo chick was snapping him and it drove me nuts Every excuse in the book about how she got his snapchat Now he s back on it and never told me why he went back on it I only knew because I saw his score going up His Facebook is literally a 2 1 ratio of women to men Many of which are about 5 8 years my junior and look fantastic He told me he talks to someone on facebook messenger but I ve no idea who and it doesn t mean anything apparently The majority of the women in his friends list are young attractive people I ve never even heard of or know of He admitted once before that he would ve fucked one of them if he d had the chance I m sure he feels that way about most of them but is keeping his mouth shut after I got upset when he d said that about one particular girl He claims to hate the girls he works with yet he s mates with all of them on facebook and I suspect he was the one who seeked them out because his name on there isn t the name he goes by and he told me he did this so his profile would be more private I m sick of feeling like a placeholder until he finds someone better I m sick of being told I m a paranoid weirdo who s making stuff up To be honest I wish he d just go ahead and leave me for one of them so I wouldn t have to deal with feeling like a piece of unwanted disgusting meat all the time I hate everything about myself I just want to punch the fucking mirror I m sick of him hiding things and being so ridiculously private about his phone Mostly I hate feeling like I m just a complete fool This is why I should be alone forever I m done ranting Just had to let it out somewhere because I m hurting and feel so insignificant,Emotional Distress

I m not sure really what s going on with this but I m starting to get skeeved out and stressed over it My therapist works a training clinic I had seen them during a really bad time and was really struggling They re a nice person and caring but I never really felt they were quite the right fit It was hard for me to find a therapist at all people didn t want to take me and my funds were so low I couldn t afford but the lowest sliding scale They were there for me when the chips were down and they seem like good people I appreciate their hard work and all they ve done I feel like it s time to move on but I want to be on good terms and keep the door open ie in a heathy way not burn bridges as I have done in the past It s pretty important to me to handle the situation both gracefully and healthily I ve been seeing this person twice a week for eight months They will not give up Every time I started talking about seeking alternate therapy there was resistance about me quitting I think it was more about them failing than accepting that this was a waypoint for me until I could find another resource I was clear from the beginning that talk therapy has not historically worked for me I think 20 years of talk therapy says enough that from DBT behavioral and exposure therapies I have seen the most incredible results They were not trained in those therapies I finally told them I was looking for a group to supplement therapy this was a non threat to them because I waa not leaving but supplementing therapy I was really searching for a new therapist For some reason I could not look for a new therapist without her permission something about them being OK with me looking for a group allowed me to seek other therapists i might happen to stumble across a therapist in my search which would not be an outright rejection or I might be required to see a therapist from the group that hosted a clinic they kinda struggled with that one but it was an acceptable rule beyond their control otherwise I felt guilty I felt wrong and I couldn t oppose the therapists wish for me to stay I knew this was unhealthy whether it was coming from her or me or both the dynamic was not good So finally I found a new therapist to try My old therapist was very resistant kept saying they wanted a last session they were available to talk I mentioned the alternate therapy modality that new therapist has as way of not rejecting therapist Old therapist was OK they were not trained in that skill and perhaps I could see new therapist ALONG WITH THEM FOR TALK THERAPY no escape I spoke to new therapist they said that they would prefer to handle the talk therapy along with alt modality but were open to me retaining old therapist while I m screaming noooo inside I told old therapist that I didn t want to risk losing coverage insurance is tricky this is true insurance has a rule about overlapping therapists I said I d like to see new therapist for now and see how it goes So basically we re not terminating just going on hiatus Well old therapist went on vacation and when she came back she called me asking why I hadn t showed up for routine appt and now there s been messages back and forth about how I should have a termination session or at least phone conversation WE HAD A FUCKING TERMI ATION SESSION ALREADY BEFORE SHE LEFT I don t know how many times we need to discuss that I m leaving to see the new therapist that I need time to figure out the fit I am doing the hiatus thing and not terminating absolutely because termination just upsets her so much and I don t want to burn that bridge I wanted to be on good terms if the new therapist doesn t work out it would be nice to be on good terms with the old therapist if I ever need references records or even if I did want to go back for something else this whole situation feels so unhealthy I don t think I can now I don t want them to get angry and sabotage me whether accidentally passive aggression maybe just something that happens because they were alienated and not so careful maybe slipped up because they didn t really like me I just don t want this to follow me in some negative way I don t know what to do anymore I have been avoiding calling thrm back I will bite the bullet and do it I really don t want this to keep dragging out but I m hesitating because I m not certain of the best way to handle It s become very stressful The longer I sit on it the worse it is,Emotional Distress
I have BPD but I have to hide it cuz social stigma I can t talk with my friends I once tried to talk with my ex ex boyfriend about this but he was into those hippy stuff where psychology is a stupid thing with stupid labels With the last boyfriend I had I tried to hide my BPD For the first period was good but after 5 6 months I started to do BPD things after an year when everything was getting worse I had a kind of crisis and I told everything to him he cried with me and he ask me why I had been hiding that thing that he can understand everything Then after a week he left me cuz he said that he wasn t enough strong for that and after a week he started to date another girl For my father I m a ghost my mother is a teenager and when I feel bad she runs away for my brother I m like a garbage cuz he said that if I feel bad it s only my fault cuz I m lazy I have a BPD diagnosis but they never had the interest to try to understand me When I read here friends SO and parents who try to learn how to help I feel so bad and lonely cuz I have no one who cares about me or who is trying to understand me I need to talk with someone without fear to be judged or being misunderstood I feel so lonely,Emotional Distress
I went to my psychiatrist yesterday and she said that I was doing so well and that if I wanted to I didn t have to come back and see her I suppose a normal reaction would be to feel super happy accomplished but I just feel weird She said I could see a gp if I felt the need I ve never been to a gp without wanting to cry afterwards lol What if I get sick again What if I m not creative anymore Did I just make the whole thing up Was I fine this whole time I said I would come back for one last session I m such a cling on omg why Any advice I m sorry if this comes across as humble brag it really isn t It s like I was so comfortable with being sick like after five years I ve come around to the idea and then all of a sudden I m okay again,Emotional Distress
So I never really used to sit down and methodically rationalize my feelings and it always used to be trigger gt HURT gt react gt lash out But ever since I ve tried it out I ve realized that the pattern is really consistent For example last night my SO and I engaged in a pretty heavy intellectual debate about some issues He finished it off by saying that he would ask his friend s opinion on it because his friend is smart I got upset because it sounded like he was saying that I was stupid and that my opinion wasn t worth anything to him and he apologized for making me feel disrespected and belittled That didn t sit well with me Was I upset because I felt disrespected and belittled I realized the answer was no I was upset because my train of thought had taken this route He thinks I m stupid He prefers hearing other people s opinions He has realized that other people are better than me He is going to leave me for someone else And that s when I registered that 99 of the time I was upset it was because perceived abandonment was the end station of my train of thought SO seems cold and detached He s going to leave me SO forgot to do something he said he would do He doesn t care enough to remember so that means he s going to leave me SO talks about his friends and seems happy He obviously likes them better and he s going to leave me Like yeah I knew perceived abandonment was a big deal but I just realized how huge of a role it plays into my life,Emotional Distress

One of the more healthy means of coping I dabble in involves writing poetry I thought perhaps some of you might enjoy it Or perhaps some of you write as well and could give me pointers It is a slight change on the Terzanelle poetry style The depravity sinks into her skin Hope dissolving into trepidation Abandoned the consequence of her sin Hope dissolving into trepidation Remnants of love macabre dance round her head Detachment apathy her sedation Remnants of love macabre dance round her head Blinding herself with thoughts of exuberance Unhinged on manic passion she retreads Blinding herself with thoughts of exuberance Splitting as infatuation turns gray Overwhelmed giving way to a nuisance Splitting as infatuation turns gray Whispers break the shell with the force of screams Petulant relations in disarray Whilst thoughts of tenderness drown her in bliss Morrow she will sing songs of emptiness The depravity sinks into her skin Abandoned the consequence of her sin A P EDIT I cannot seem to get it to break into stanzas Everything is a three line stanza except for the last four lines,Emotional Distress
Today wasn t the best day I tried to go to the doctor on my own and when I told my mom what had happened at the doctor she basically told me I did it all wrong and reaffirmed my feelings that I m so inept at 22 and can t do shit for myself Meanwhile I m reminded that everyone else is growing up and moving on to start adult lives and getting married and I m still the perpetual child who s chronically lonely Top that off my one friend who I m actually able to talk to about things hasn t replied to me in a few days so naturally I m assuming she hates me and or is ignoring me Honestly I believe it has something to do with her boyfriend who no one including myself cares for I just want someone to talk to who can help me out It s been so long 8 months and a day since I last cut myself and I m very proud that I ve managed that but I just feel bad I m not saying I m going to hurt myself I ve tried very hard to move past that but I d be a liar if I wasn t thinking about it recently I would open up in a heartbeat to anyone I have to try and stop myself when I m talking to people because I ll just start to divulge a ton of stuff I just fear that trying to find someone new to talk to and be like Hey I feel like shit a lot of the time and I need someone will be off putting idk man,Suicidal Reference
A while ago I got an email friend She s diagnosed with BPD and a whole bunch of anxiety disorders is basically barely functional but really hearty and a nice source of emotional support which I really need due to my own mental issues We got along really well since we re very similar and could easily understand each other s behavior Basically it was a wonderful friendship and I was easily able to adapt to her needs like messaging her regularly so she knows I m still there and not gone Unfortunately at some point she felt so awful that she admitted herself to a psych ward She left after only a few weeks though because she said it didn t help her at all Now I did a horrible thing I was feeling really awful and needed solitude and decided to cut off everyone including her Eventually I apologized but she said that incident really hit her hard I expected that much since I know what her mind does with things like that Now that was the last time I heard of her Since then she hasn t messaged me at all in any form That s totally unlike her normally she leaves me a message if she takes longer to write me a reply for some reason I m worried that my incident with her put her over the border and made her commit suicide I was aware of how stressed she was over her life and now I feel it s my fault she took her life because it was all too much for her What do you think Do you agree that it was my fault or do you think that it was completely unrelated and she would ve taken her life anyway,Suicidal Reference
This past year has been yet another chaotic year in what has become an extremely chaotic decade for me A year ago I was researching ways to kill myself while trying to figure out how I could rationalize my actions to my daughter In two weeks I will be attending my father s funeral As I watched him die I realized that I could never rationalize making my daughter or anyone else who loves me feel the way I felt that night In his last moments my dad who was my greatest support made me want to fight to live That one day I will be surrounded by people I love but that I will have time to say goodbye I wanted to share some thoughts that I have realized that may help Don t waste time on people who do not accept or respect you We are all worthy of being loved and having our feelings validated Having our feelings validated simply means that someone acknowledges how you are feeling The only way that someone can acknowledge how you feel is to be honest about how you are feeling How we are feeling may be based on misunderstandings misinterpretations or past experiences They may be rational or irrational only you can truly decide for yourself Everyone has their own truth their own story their own past and their own feelings which you should be willing to acknowledge in return Being dishonest always destroys Nothing real can grow from it Hiding your feelings is being dishonest with yourself and others Being honest about your feelings does not mean not taking how others feel into consideration but recognizing that how you feel is important as well My father did not share his honest feelings so we could not validate them A lifetime of people who did not respect and accept him put stress on his heart and body He made mistakes based on misunderstandings and past experiences which had huge negative consequences He hid these mistakes from most because he could not be honest with them which put further stress on him My brother and I raised in this environment have gone decades barely talking As we started our own families though we realized that being dishonest only makes things harder and stressful We are able to talk to our partners about subjects that our parents would never be able to to confront problems that our parents ignored But it wasn t until my father passed away that we could finally be honest with each other Many times we talked about improving our relationship but neither of us were willing to be honest about how we felt I have gone from not talking to my brother for months to feeling disappointed if I didn t get a chance to say hi and see how his day went His willingness to validate how I feel has made all the difference to me and it has only been possible because I was willing to be honest We have been able to begin to understand why we feel the way we do and what happened in the past to make us feel that way I stopped hating my brother a long time ago but it is only now that I can say I both love and like him These are just my feelings You don t have to agree with me All anyone can ask is that we are respected for being honest with each other If someone cannot do that at the very least then they do not deserve to share their time thoughts or feelings with you,Suicidal Reference

Hey there I ve been a lurker on this sub for ages but never actually been an active member I guess the first step to join this community is to introduce myself innit I know this is going to be long and most of you are probably not going to care but heck maybe someone can relate I m 17 years old I ve never been properly diagnosed with BPD but my father he s a med school teacher and used to be psychiatrist you ll learn more about him later diagnosed me when I was 11 or 12 I used to be a normal kid everything was okay and I didn t really suffer of bullying I was just boringly normal another white trash kid as my family used to have tons of money and I had everything I wanted Then when I was at 8th grade 11yo parents suddenly seemed like new lovers again I was a bit jealous because I wasn t getting all of the attention anymore but I was happy for them Then one tragic day my father came home earlier than usual he usually got home at 9pm because of his work He announced that he had something to tell me My first thought was they were getting a baby and that frightened me But no the news was that they were getting a divorce He told me that he had an affair with a student of his 20 years younger and they were moving together Later I learnt he had told my mother about the affair a few months before and she gave him another chance thus the sudden love between them I had my first dissociative experience right then And a panic attack as well I fell on the floor curled into a ball and started crying it was the last time in my life I cried like that I simply could not believe it I didn t really care about my father going away I had never had such a relationship with him I mean I loved him but I only saw him on the weekends but I simply could NOT believe how come they switched from acting like a new couple to this He left that same night and my mother comforted me for a few days I was unable to go to school I selfishly ignored that she d feel MUCH WORSE than I did and it should ve been ME who comforted her I still feel like shit because of that My mother didn t deserve that My father is a bastard But I m worse I didn t even notice my father s abscense but it was as if I had lost a part of me I don t remember much of those weeks I believe I didn t go to school for a while I wasn t deppresed I just felt nothing and everything at the same time Hate Lots of hate Hate towards my father Hate towards his girlfriend Hate towards my mom for letting him go But most of all hate towards myself why though After a while I got kinda stable Some afternoons my father came over and we did the normal father and son stuff I was alright with that But I wanted to stay at my mother s He tried to take me to his place but I denied I became a computer geek I got bullied severly at school but I didn t care as I had major trouble home and nobody knew Until a day came when my mother announced I d spend every other weekend at my father s I didn t want that I WOULD notice my mother s abscense I was taken to my father s against my will I met his girlfriend and hated her from the beggining I cried and cried and they didn t seem to care But I remained quiet I didn t say a word about why I was crying or I just said I miss my mother The truth was I don t want to be here The first summer they were divorced I spent at my father s That was the most terrifying experience in my life I had to sleep in a boxroom because they had no space for me It was a house full of contradictions His girlfriend was nice to me but I still hated her and she knew it All I did was cry and cry and cry I called my mother every night I started creating a fantasy to make it more bearable I was 12 and acting like a kid because it was the only way to deffend myself from the situation One day my father asked what was wrong and I spit I just don t want to be here He started crying and said Okay do you want me to take you to your mother s again I said No because this is how it s meant to be isn t it So I stayed there for the summer Shortly thereafter my father s negligences started They moved to a new house rather a mansion and I resumed the every other weekend regime He started psychologically abusing me He went nuts He was diagnosed with MDD then bipolar disorder and OCD PD I couldn t do anything at his new place I couldn t touch a thing as he d insult me for not being clean enough If I had to drink water I d clean the glass and leave everything untouched Sometimes I couldn t even eat he wouldn t give me food arguing that he and his girlfriend who s overweight went on a diet and didn t have any food for me Great I stayed quiet I got underweight I didn t tell my mother The next summer when I was 13 he told me he was going to rehab because of alcoholism Great he turned out to be an alcoholic too Now I know it was my fault I caused his depression and alcoholism by showing my hate towards him and basically prove I do not love him anymore He went to rehab then got out and stayed sober for half a year Things were great then I was happy I didn t love him but I got used to going to his place and sort of enjoyed the benefits of partially belonging to the upper class my mother on the other hand is rather poor now my father pays her 800 month just because Then on February 2013 I almost died He had relapsed and I remember him locking himself in the kitchen after meals and drinking a shit ton That horrible Sunday he had to drive me to my mother s place He was terribly drunk I had never seen him that bad He was clearly unable to drive His wife they got married saw this and did NOTHING She let him drive me home and I ll never forgive him for that We almost had an accident That s all I remember I dissociated and had a panic attack I got to my mother s place shaking I sort of collapsed and fell on the floor and started crying I couldn t hold it no more I told her everything About the alcoholism about the bipolar disorder about the negligence about how much I hated him and hated me What was her response to all that He s still your father and you ought to keep seing him or you ll regret that I said I still don t want to go and she forced me to keep the every other weekend regime Awful right TRIGGER WARNING STARTS HERE I was totally hopeless I did not know what to do I was 14 at that time I started cutting myself I wanted to die I tried to kill myself several times I cut in my thighs and right arm regularly I stopped cutting 3 years ago and I still have the scars They won t fade I started smoking cigarettes I started stealing my father s medication mainly benzos and Ritalin I still do this Forgot to say that he s addicted to benzos and they fried his brain Great I also started smoking weed I got heavily into drugs I had several arguments with my mother all concluding with you still ought to see him That harmed me the most One year later on 2014 things got stable at his place He still insults me sometimes but I ve grown to not care Just fuck him I found new friends I turned out to be bi and didn t hide it As of 2014 I met my soulmate my best friend the love of my life I have maybe only three real friends but they re all I have I love them They know what I ve been through and try to understand it My best friend has been through some several shit as well and I think she has BPD too On early 2015 the war outside me stopped Everything is alright now But now I have a war within I m struggling again My BPD is getting worse and worse The only stable things in my life are my drug use and my love to David Bowie I can t have a relationship I ve had a lot and they last a few weeks because I will get terribly irritated with the person and start insulting them I love you then I hate you Then I hate me for hating you because I love you but you don t realize it My love is hate If I hate you I love you If I love you I hate you Love what a stupid word Even my best friend I often hate But I try TERRIBLY HARD to shut the hell up and remain quiet when I have these short hate episodes towards her because I know if I loose her I die Simply like that Most people see me like a junkie but I have the highest GPA in my grade and one of the best in the history of my school I m on my way to med school I don t use drugs that hardly anymore I used to binge on methylphenidate for days not sleep nor eat go to school and snort it in the bathrooms and the like Now I m more into downers I recently got ahold of Xanax great I take benzos almost daily just to numb my insides I m probably missing something but that s mostly it Sorry for the horribly long text I don t expect you to read it But if you do THANK YOU I hate reading long texts but I love writing them lol I should start writing again,Suicidal Reference
I have been so depressed lately I feel so alone I have no one to talk to anymore my parents just get really concerned and tell me to go see my phyic again but they don t know she dumped me months ago my best friend doesn t understand and I m too scared to talk to anyone else Every time someone I m close to a friend an relative a romance they just leave As if they are disgusted by me like I m crazy or unreasonable Then they just disappear and never talk to me again Or at least the same way they used to I can t take it when people leave like that I feel like I m a fucking plague victim and they just don t want to caught it Every time I break down I just feel like screaming at everything and everyone I become so irritable then I just cry and shrink into a dark box Okay I see where this is going it s going nowhere just leading me to another suicide attempt which I ll fail at like everything I do It s not that my life is a mess everything is on track I ll soon me fine with school and in my chosen career field ems Then there is that feeling again of the water reciting into the bay before the tsunami the loneliness and depression crushing me down Maybe it s the drugs MDMA LSD cocaine Dxm But those don t seem to be a problem they always help me feel better or at least distract me When I was a big stoner I saw my symptoms relax I felt better I could talk to people again I could smile But now with all this state regulated drug testing fear mongering bullshit all I can take is my adderal prescribed for my ADHD by a doctor who gets paid to sell to his patients If I don t take it they will take way my car again All it does is worsen the tsunami I feel so alone now I want someone to talk to I think I need some help Please,Suicidal Reference
I don t want to die but I want to kill myself It is without a doubt the weirdest paradox one can stare but that is my life right now This is a long story and I would suggest just going here first http suicideproject org 2015 08 im a good person right right The emptiness from there has gotten even worse He stole thousands of dollars out of my bank account stole my S6 edge PS4 Vita and tons of games to sell for cash for drugs I kicked him out of the house but I failed my best friend who I shouldn t even call a friend and have come to the conclusion that I am going to have watch him kill himself with his addiction I already struggle with depression and BPD and these events have left me with nothing There are rooms in my own house I no longer go into because the pain is so much I have great friends but I always feel alone I have a decent job that pays well but I hate it I sleep most days just to get through the day and I am at my wits end My therapist is trying her hardest but I still feel do alone to the point I can t even manage to want to live If it wasn t for the pain it would cause others I would have done it by now surprise someone with BPD being selfless How do you deal with it I have become a BPD poster boy indulging in meaningless sex going on shopping sprees binge drinking when I go out etc But the next day the pain and emptiness is still there Please help me I want to live but the pain is just too much,Suicidal Reference

To be clear not diagnosed with anything at the moment though I m in therapy so tell me to go elsewhere if needed I just needed to rant I guess and try to distract my mind from the almost overwhelming urge to take a bunch of asprin vodka and cut I don t want to die but I wouldn t be so bothered if I did Nobody cares about me enough to be bothered by my loss for more than a few weeks then they d be fine My husband would be upset but I know that in time he would move on and find someone worthy of his love I want that for him but I know I will never leave because I love him too much and couldn t survive without him anyway I m so fucked up I think it would be a relief to be sectioned or go to hospital for a few weeks so that I didn t have to deal with reality Everything just sucks I have a brilliant husband who looks after me and I know others would do anything for that so I hate myself for feeling so sad all of the time and wasting his life I don t deserve to feel so bad I beat myself up for everything a million times more than the normal person would and I just wish that it would all stop I am so goddamn tired of everything I never forget anything Even something as stupid as near Christmas time I played a stupid prank on my friend and flicked her nose forgetting she had been pierced recently and it hurt her She looked so angry that I was so paranoid she hated me I still think about it now knowing she must often think me selfish and stupid and not worth the effort Everybody does All I do is let people down then they have enough and leave It happens all of the time and I can t take it anymore I don t feel like my issues are real and bad enough to warrant me seeing a therapist and know everyone thinks I just need to get the fuck over it and stop attention seeking I know they think that and it hurts because I m not I don t want to be this way feeling anger so burning I can physically feel it and feel it is the only thing I will ever feel go from loving to hating someone in two seconds flat and for the stupidest reasons be so paranoid that everybody will leave that some days it is all I can do to get out of bed and I don t even always manage that I have no idea who I am so I ll wear boots because I want to be a punk chick one day I ll wear floral and pin my hair up because I want to be a vintage girl the next I work so hard on my appearance in the vain hope that it detracts people from anything of substance but none of it means a goddamn thing to me I don t expect anybody to read this far and even if so don t expect a reply because it is self indulgent bullshit and I need to get the fuck over it I guess I just hoped that because I can t handle calling someone for help that by writing out some of the things running through my mind here it would buy me enough time to calm down and not do something stupid,Suicidal Reference
tl dr Friend is really negative and uses tactics that I m uncomfortable with to engage me I called her out on the behavior and now my other friendships seem to be affected because of it From what I know she has never been diagnosed with a personality disorder however she s suggested in the past that she s spoken to professionals about BPD I really just want a compassionate look at the behaviour and whether I ve acted poorly from all angles Previously posted to r relationships and r BPDlovedones I m also trying to give my version of events in an environment where I don t seem like I m antagonizing her so yeah advice from strangers on the internet may be best Hi My friend lets call her Steph has been a really good friend looking back We hadn t known each other for very long about 2 years but we got close really quickly because we lived right next to each other and also because she d always tell me about her problems usually about her relationship with her boyfriend and I d listen occasionally giving advice She d always make me cups of coffee or just generally be really nice getting me presents and I really loved having her around After a while she broke up with her boyfriend which I d been telling her to do for a while he seemed quite arrogant and could be quite mean from what she d tell me At this point she met a new guy who I had known for a little while at that point and I was really happy for them A few months later I noticed that she d complain about her new boyfriend lets call him Mike just as much I knew the guy so I thought that doesn t sound like something he d do but I d keep pushing it aside and just saying I m sure it ll be fine or being shocked that he d act in a negative way towards her We d recently made some new friends as well around where we lived one guy lets call him Jacob was already quite close with Mike and me and him became friends too Around this time she told me she d been treated by a therapist for anxiety and that she took medication I told her it was fine One day out of the blue she sends me a message on facebook asking if I m free to talk I was out at the time but I replied asking what was up She told me she d been feeling quite down and thinking about killing herself I reacted in the only way I knew how by telling her she d eventually feel better I know it seems irrational but for a few months I had that incident hanging over me Was I a bad friend Did I react badly Why do I even feel like this Since that day and for the last half of our relationship she just kept complaining about everything and everyone She d ask people to visit and then complain about how much they didn t care about her or used her Jacob who befriended her boyfriend would always be made out to be awful Sometimes she d say the same thing about Mike like how he doesn t care about her feelings Through all this I kept reassuringly telling her everything would be fine nodding along at her complaint even though I thought it was mainly her anxiety at this point After a while I began to realize I hadn t had a positive conversation with her in about 6 months but I kept just putting it down to her anxieties I was on vacation with my family and she sent me an email saying I d forgotten about her and that she d find somebody else to talk to if I couldn t be there for her I flipped at that point thinking I ve barely spoken to my family for the last 6 month haven t spoken to my boyfriend in a week vacation and she s accusing me of not caring about the friendship when I spent so much time with her I told her that she could be really emotionally manipulative and that it was hard to deal with and that the way she tries to get attention from people isn t healthy I told her that we are different people and I can t be friends with her as it s beginning to be stressful exhausting detrimental to my mental health btw i m on vacation At that point I d noticed she d put up a status on facebook not that long after saying effectively that people didn t understand her illness and that they should try more I got really defensive at this point because the timings were too perfect and I m really private She said I was imagining things and what i m not allowed to write a status She refused to admit responsibility for anything so I told her i d rather not be friends At this point Steph would call me and I d ignore because i was angry she tried every trick under the sun to make me engage with her Talking to me via a group chat about something unrelated asking Mike to message me and see if I m okay and then eventually I had enough and asked her not to try and contact me We have a lot of the same friends so I knew I d have to see her around I had a party to go to which I knew she d be at so I thought If I don t go people might assume there s something wrong with me so I decided why not I got there and because the things I d said to her were still fresh and I very much felt still felt hurt I spent the whole evening keeping my distance talking to people I hadn t spoken to before enjoying myself and stuff We went to get food afterwards and I ordered and sat down We were with a large group of people so there wasn t enough room for all of us to sit together So I sat at a different table from the main group with a few other friends while she sat with Mike and a couple others The next day I went home and thought great I can actually spend time with people without having to act like her best friend and she seemed to handle it well We d usually been super talkative with each other but I thought if I m mad it would be disingenuous to act like her best friend and besides I didn t feel like I even wanted to I was still a little butt hurt about my vacation I get a message from Jacob saying Steph been talking about me and thinks I m out to get her I asked him honestly whether after the time he s known me he believes that to be true He said no you wouldn t do that I leave it alone and continue my summer of peaceful solitude About 3 weeks later Mike sends me a message telling me to understand her feeling that this is difficult for her and that i m being malicious In the message he also wrote that something along the lines of if you make this about you and her you won t win I knew at that moment his conflict of interest meant he couldn t be impartial and I told him not to get involved Repeatedly He kept pushing me though and after a while I realized that he was just another way for her to vent her feelings at me He told me I was emotionally distant that that night the one I thought went well I had scoffed at her repeatedly ignored her when she tried to talk to me and that when I sat at the table it was maliciously and in order to hurt her by splitting the group up I did the same thing as with Jacob because I knew I hadn t spoken to anyone about mine and Steph s disagreement unless they came to me first I asked Mike if he honestly thought that I was maliciously taking the group away or whether I just sitting down Long story short he accused me of being malicious even though I m certain I wasn t Just distant to avoid some of the behaviors I didn t like Basically at the end of this I ve been called insensitive unable to deal with people emotionally and difficult because I don t want Steph to treat me the way she does Any advice would be great before this gets worse I don t know what I ve done or if I ve acted in an insensitive way because I feel as though too many people are telling me I have Maybe its because I ve avoided speaking about it to others and she hasn t HELP PLEASE EDIT 1 I only told her to break up with her BF when she told me he was being abusive 2 She was dating her new BF before breaking up with the old one slight overlap of a couple months 3 He new BF was my friend that I introduced her too 4 When I told her it was fine that she had a mental illness It wasn t to validate anything it was me telling my friend who was worried how i d react that I didn t care if she took meds or had a mental illness Edit 2 I noticed a post by a mod about seeking diagnosis I don t want a diagnosis I just want to know if I acted in an insensitive manner and how somebody who has BPD may perceive the situation,Suicidal Reference

This is my first time posting anything on reddit and I just don t know how to continue with my life it just seems to have fallen apart Sorry its going to be very long and rambling I met this guy lets call him A just over 18 months ago and even though i was married at the time i instantly fell for him We ended up talking by text email and any other way possible all day every day He told me he found me attractive but was not attracted to me After a few months of constant talking i confided in him about some abuse i experienced as a teenager Apparently i stopped disassociating with it then because he was the first to actually care and had to start dealing with it And thats when everything went downhill He couldn t handle what i was telling him and the constant talking and after a big argument he stopped talking to me for 10 weeks over the summer last year During that time i fell apart and couldn t do anything and tried to talk to him but he just ignored me until one email where he replied and we became friends again but not as close as before My husband hated the friendship and kept trying to limit contact but i ended up trying to secretly text him as i just needed the contact For the rest of the year it was very intense and argumentative and he stopped talking to me more than he was talking I made the decision to leave my husband at the end of last year for two reasons Firsy being that he was physically abusive to me and secondly because i liked the friend more than him and it was unfair to my husband to stay with him At the start of this year the friendship got very close and because i was now single it also got intimate He knew that i loved him and i knew that he didn t want a relationship but i didn t care i was finally close to him At A s insistence i started a relationship with someone else B but the whole time A kept trying to have phone sex with me and i eventually ended it with B because i was still in love with A And then the intimacy carried on with both of them and they both knew i was having sex with the other My depression and anxiety continued to get worse until i was signed off work A couldn t handle talking to me over the previous few weeks and had cut the talking from all day to 5 minutes a day When he turned off his phone i went round his house to try and talk to him When i was signed off work A immediately stopped talking to me saying that he was the problem and i couldn t get better with him around Without his support i just got worse I couldn t eat sleep or function in any way Things got slightly better when i was with my family for 2 weeks but when i got home i got worse again He had moved out of his house and temporarily changed numbers so that i couldn t contact him Which brings me to this week Last saturday after going round his house and finding he had moved back home i knocked on his door and he wouldn t answer On monday He passed a message to me through someone else saying he couldn t cope with me and the friendship was over I ended up overdosing and he called the police after i texted him saying what i had done I ended up in hospital overnight and then because i was ok they let me go home On wednesday B said he couldn t be friends with me because of my overdose on Monday and i then overdosed again and the hospital let me go home again the next day On Friday i overdosed again and went round his house and knocked on his door for an hour before going back home He called the police but this time to give me a warning about harassment and to not contact him I went back in hospital overnight and the mental health nurse said that my overdosing wasn t because i was suicidal but as a form of self harm to express the pain I m feeling from abandonment I asked if i could stay as i couldn t look after myself at home and they said no so was sent home again I can t handle the pain of abandonment from A I need him and i can t cope without his support I m barely eating and i can t do normal things like personal hygiene I just can t cope I ve annoyed another friend as all i want to talk about is A But i only have him and another friend who is female but i can t be close friends with her because she is female Plus i haven t been intimate with her and it seems i can only trust someone after having sex with them How do i cope Its been 8 weeks since i last spoke to him and I m just getting worse every day especially now he s said he doesn t want to ever be friends with me which i don t 100 believe as he has said it loads of times before,Suicidal Reference

Today I woke up wishing I were dead and the day continued to feed into how much I hate myself how much I don t deserve anything I have in life how useless and worthless I am how much I deserve pain and suffering for how much of a monster I am These feelings run pretty deep on a daily basis but throughout today they have been reaffirmed by my mother Wow the pores on your nose look terrible today and You shouldn t see that hypnotherapist any more you re a lost cause then my SO invited me to his best friends birthday all I could respond with was I appreciate the offer but I am too much of a buzzkill I don t want to ruin his birthday After sending that text I felt like I must sound like a needy insecure bitch after attention or something but in reality I just don t feel like I deserve to go because I honestly believe I ll fuck it up and make it less fun for them The only way I ve ever handled these emotions is through self destructive behaviours Self harm one night stands or drinking til I am unable to do those 2 things The scars validate that I am a monster and the one night stands validate that I am a worthless whore It makes sense of the emotions it grounds me I abused my PRN for awhile so it isn t an option tonight Through all my years I ve been told to do the opposite of this emotion self soothe but it honestly just makes me sick thinking of something pleasant for me Just drinking water right now is difficult it should be poison But I know deep down I don t want to relapse I don t want to keep feeding this emotion I just don t know how to keep distracting myself from it I can distract til the next morning but the feeling doesn t pass it isn t a wave like they make it out to be tldr what should I do when the feeling of self loathing is too much to distract and self soothe from,Suicidal Reference

I ve done a lot of reading on Borderline Personality Disorder and I have a lot of the symptoms I m very impulsive and frequently have impulsive sex drink too much smoke too much spend money recklessly drive recklessly and am very emotionally dependent on marijuana and cigarettes I ve vacillated between certain beliefs and values in the past never settling on just one For instance going to youth group and trying to be a Christian and then realizing I m an atheist but then going back to youth group the very next day Or if I m speaking to someone who doesn t share one of my beliefs I ll find myself thinking Oh they re probably right and I m wrong and my beliefs will change for a while then go back to the old way of thinking My sense of self is warped Not only do I not have much self esteem I can t figure out what I want in life I can t decide what I want to do as a career Once I start to feel like I know what I want the feelings of worthlessness come and I lose all aspiration And like before if someone challenges something I regard highly no matter that person s importance to me I ll significantly doubt myself The same people I don t think I could survive without I often find myself thinking and saying really nasty and negative things about I get angry way too easily I fall in love with people very quickly and lose interest in them just as fast My main emotions are emptiness depression anxiety and anger Sometimes I have crazy mood swings and become giddy energetic only to be miserable an hour later over nothing The first time I wanted to kill myself I was in fifth grade I struggled through suicidal thoughts constantly in college and still do and was hospitalized for a week once when I had actually made a plan and came close to doing it I m very paranoid One time I thought the government was following me Whenever I hear police sirens I wonder if they re coming for me My main paranoia is that people talk bad about me behind my back that people conspire against me that the whole world is designed to keep me from being happy Rejection can make me lose any kind of emotional control I know of course I can t call myself a sufferer of BPD until I ve been formally diagnosed I m seeing my therapist amp psychiatrist next week and want to discuss this with them But my fear is that they won t take me seriously or honor my fears or the thought that I ve given this No therapist I ve ever seen has been willing to diagnose me with anything they d only discuss and name individual symptoms but never tell me You have these problems because you have Generalized Anxiety Disorder Clinical Depression etc Usually it s some bullshit about how naming the disease won t cure it just focus on the individual symptoms or worse that I ll use the diagnosis as an excuse for my behavior I always feel misunderstood in some way by any therapist I see It s almost like I really WANT to be diagnosed with BPD so that I can at least have a name for why my brain works the way it does I want my mental illness to have a name so I know what I m up against Whatever the diagnosis is I just want a diagnosis I want to be told which mental illness I have How can I explain this to my therapist psychiatrist Has anyone else ever had mental health professionals refuse to diagnose you And has anyone else ever figured out they had BPD before a mental health professional formally diagnosed you,Suicidal Reference

I m just doing this because someone who commented on my last post asked for updates I m currently in the ER in a bed and gown My babysitter told me I ll be here for a while before they transfer me to a local mental health facility I spent hours with my roommate driving me around on a wild goose chase to the center I was told to go to on the phone this morning only to find out that they wouldn t treat me there because it was the wrong county Office hours close at 5 the guy there told me to come to this specific hospital because they have inpatient I am so tired of repeating myself over and over to different nurses and doctors my story so I should get used to it It is painful to talk about Every time I start my story I start crying I don t need surgery for the other issue as of yet but they called me on my way here telling me to come in for procedure in a few days if it still hurts again My mother is camping my father has been texting with me but texts and calls don t work in this hospital My sponsor has been great I met new women in AA today one of which I already met because she was already on my phone and she didn t remember me even though I called her before Every time I try to get a sponsor they flake out on me except the one where he lives and she s been in constant contact with me Whenever I text or call her I hear back and she always has good things to say Hopeful things I wish my brother would talk to me I wish the man that broke up with me this morning would talk to me but I told him I m not contacting him anymore until I m done treatment He texted me while I was in my AA meeting today saying he s glad I m getting help I have a disease and an addiction problem and he broke up with me over it obfuscation from shame did it I lied I don t like lying Lied by omission I told the truth a few days later My friends say he s not worth it if he can t stick by me while I suffer and try to get better Alcohol is but a symptom of a larger issue I can and will get better I m grateful for hope today I ll never stop loving him or wanting to be with him but I m glad he broke up with me somewhat so I can concentrate on getting better for myself and not anyone else At the same time I wish I could hold his hand I wish he would tell me everything is going to be okay and that we ll be together again once I m better But there s just silence Silence and lots of noise Noise around me Clanging and shuffling hospital workers whatever show is on TV that I have only glanced at once My babysitter s shift is over so now I have a new one They want to make sure I don t do anything stupid Just had my blood drawn I made a joke about my anonymous blogging Blood was being fussy had to do both arms I haven t eaten anything today I told the lady she s finding me a snack I m pretty sure mental health centers don t allow phones or laptops my phone is plugged into my sleeping now password protected laptop I should get a USB adapter Meh I suppose it s good I m doing this now Thanks to plath for being so consistent with his support Thanks to all of you for reading and offering yours before It s good to not feel alone even though essentially I am now It s just like that Azure Ray song November So much,Suicidal Reference
I guess I m writing because I don t know what to do anymore I feel both numb and horribly hurt inside I m crazy stressed out I m passively suicidal again and I haven t been in years and I want to self harm like nothing else also haven t done that in years But I feel like I have nowhere to go My husband and I are moving in under 2 weeks and I still have all the packing to do Besides this it means that now that I m falling apart I have no where and no one to go to No therapist psychiatrist could get me in in the next few weeks so there s no help there My husband s busy with wrapping up his work stuff and I feel bad for constantly asking him to put my pieces back together So I sit here alone at home not wanting to do anything but hurt myself and just cry I feel broken empty useless I ve been with my husband for almost 7 years we just got married in May And I just feel like the most horrible burden I got diagnosed with Borderline in April we suspected all along but honestly because of his training in psychology neither one of us wanted to put that name on it And now I feel like I m just proving all the reasons for the stigma true I m needy and clingy I m not supporting him the way he needs either I m sucking energy and time out of him I cried this morning when he left for work because it felt like an abandonment But by all accounts we re doing great We re moving states soon hopefully buying a house within a few months he just got a great much higher paying job and I have 2 job interviews coming up hopefully Everything is going great so why am I falling apart now I ve been mentally ill since I was 12 First depression then bipolar II and now finally borderline where I really belonged all along I thought I was fine I thought I had some stuff to learn I planned to start DBT after our move But it s always been one long slow climb upwards And now I just fell into a valley and I don t know how to get out And it s terrifying I thought I was past this past passive suicidality and thoughts of self harm Past sitting numbly staring off into nothing because I can t bring myself to do anything In the past when I felt like this I didn t care as much But now I m stable I m older I m a productive member of society No one else can see this I can t let them 26 is too old for this bullshit I m not in college anymore and I can t expect hand holding I just don t want to put everything on my husband but I don t know where else to put it He told me the other night that he knows that I love him more than I love myself And I just don t understand why he loves me at all lately I just feel inherently unlikeable Like a big lead balloon on what should be a really happy exciting time in our lives I feel like I m dragging him down and he deserves better than me Or deserves to not have to keep dragging me along with him I don t know what to do Any suggestions for just making it through I m hoping this will break and I ll be able to climb out of it but I m just kind of caught in this sneaky hate spiral Does borderline move in episodes because this last week and a half has just been hell tl dr Was doing fine now everything s falling apart and I feel more mentally ill than I have in years How do I get through the next few weeks without horribly burdening my husband even more,Suicidal Reference
Not sure if anyone else gets this but I just haven t felt like I m here the past week and a half or so Two weeks ago I had a bad freak out lost a girl embarrassed myself to friends but they understand Ever since then I ve just been checked out Time just sort of flows on and I have no idea what I m doing I have almost no interest in anything save for going to hockey and just taking aggression out Over months I ve lost all my interests or what little I had have no attention span and just feel numb Yesterday I broke down on my deck and just started crying The loneliness of my existence is killing me I m the only single person where I work lost a lot of my social circle and don t really feel the need for life I m sorta vacant and making it through the day because I have bills to pay I don t have anybody rally to confide this in other than my therapist and I have an app next week I think the realization that I ve just been isolating myself because it s the only respite I ve ever known from pain is killing me I ve missed out on most of my life and seemingly continuing it I think I needed a space to just say that I can t keep sneaking into the bathroom and tearing up Thanks for listening if you read this üòÑ,Suicidal Reference
My boyfriend or ex He left me I don t know if I should even try anymore I honestly don t want a future if it s not with him We were talking about having kids grandkids getting married I have never experienced this much pain before I have never loved anyone this much before I feel like I m dying and I kind of hope I am I gave it my all these past weeks because he said things were getting hard We agreed to try more or so I thought and he apparently gave up 2 seconds later and kept it from me even though I asked I want to die I honestly do I don t want a future I don t want to be with anyone else I secretly hope he will want me back but I know that will never happen and I would never ask him to take me back I would accept in a heartbeat it s all I really want And I want him to feel as much pain as I am feeling because I m angry It is so unfair I don t think I can do this anymore Everything that made life worth living is gone,Suicidal Reference
Long story short my honorary aunt died yesterday She was instrumental in raising me along with my mother and maternal grandparents She is leaving behind three young kids and a husband She couldn t have been older than 45 and it was sudden I m for reference 20 and have lost pretty much everyone I care about either to death or abandonment That s a lot of funerals And outside of the death of my maternal grandpa when I was 8 as well as a close friend last year I attempted suicide a few days after that one I haven t been able to feel anything It really bugs me because my mom mentioned that she had thought of swallowing her whole bottle of anti anxiety pills and was crying all night while I feel fucking empty Maybe it s just apparent competence making it look like I am being strong right now I feel empty whenever I m not having my horrendous mood swings though feeling like this now is what hurts me because I want to feel now yet can t I m just wondering how other borderlines handle death,Suicidal Reference

Ive posted countless times in the the past few days within this subreddit I have been very close to suicide a number of times in recent weeks Ive come across something interesting today somewhat by accident which someone with BPD suggested has changed their life Trauma Releasing Exercises I paid for a book which lists the 7 exercises and tried them out earlier yes I was shaking like crazy didnt get a emotional release yet Maybe Im getting too excited in suggesting this after doing the exercises one time but its just a suggestion may or may not work Theres videos on youtube for free showing the exercises or ask me and Ill send you the book FOR NOW I feel fine not great but fine relaxed and not suicidal As we know this thing is a total B d the swings are atrocious so I dont want to get my hopes too up When I think about the girl who I believed triggered this episode at this moment it hurts a little regarding certain things but nothing major Probably how a normal person would feel in my situation having not much to do but overthink But one thing I did manage earlier after the exercises a genuine smile for no apparent reason felt like myself somewhat again Just thought Id throw this out there especially seeing Ive got so much help support from everyone here Nothing to lose to those who are struggling Anyone who tries them please report back with the impact Much Love all,Suicidal Reference

I m recovering from Anorexia and self harm I m recovering from a past of physical and emotional abuse from my parents whom have NPD and sexual assaults I feel violated by life for lack of a better word Now I m trying to deal with a break up that i initiated in January in the midst of an episode I m lonely Really fucking lonely which nobody seems to understand I only really have my best friend and my therapy which is incredibly infuriating as my best friend intellectualizes everything telling me to merely stay positive as the means of rerouting the neural pathways in my brain For the first time in my life i m not utilizing intellectualization as a means of denial avoiding my traumatic past and now she s invalidating it I know i shouldn t go to her but i trust nobody I didn t start talking until i worked on myself and realized my inability to talk came from trauma and worked on that as well and i trust her about 50 of the time So i try to talk to her and this happens I go to another friend who i trust about 25 and i get sexually assaulted It s all so infuriating as my ex i trusted 100 and we used to talk about everything but that s not an option nor is my parents It s just terrifying the things flying through my mind the episodes of disassociation and now my desire to just disappear I feel so worthless just attending school mindlessly and going back to my dorm to rest I always have so much work yet rarely actually get it done according to my schedule as i m sad Just too sad I m learning to be my own person and to have a healthy lifestyle but all that it s shown me is that i m a lot more alone than i realized that all my relationships are toxic and that i don t have support in my life It makes the effort seem pointless to me I d rather go back to being sick and deluded into thinking that my anoretic chaotic self constantly getting into arguments unstable and causing problems is normality as opposed to this I m so miserable that in all honesty i don t know how i m dead I would have dropped out of school long ago but i have nowhere to live and my dorm is my home for now I don t know how i m not cutting may it s my lack of energy from the depression but i want to It just takes so much energy I still put on a happy face for my courses so nobody has questioned anything just my erratic absences I really don t know what to do My ex and i started talking after taking two months completely to ourselves and i was really happy to see that we were both doing so well as we were talking about giving things another try in the summer whenever we both felt stable in ourselves Not even that gives me any joy the one person quite literally i ve ever trusted I m so done with this disorder So done,Suicidal Reference
I was browsing through some posts about loneliness and my own relationship ending and how we all strive to fill that void And I realised that in some of my lowest points my dog and cat have been there with unconditional love and snuggles and have helped get me through that The last time I cut and was thinking about suicide my dog put her head on my lap and I stopped So I was wondering if anyone else has pets who help them or have therapy animals If that a regular thing for BPD I m thinking I should talk to my therapist about that and get my doggie trained as a therapy dog,Suicidal Reference
I am finally just so fucking exhausted trying to convince myself that I m just bipolar I m writing this out to a public forum to out myself so that maybe I can grow the balls to out myself to my IRL community or what framework still exists Hopefully this can be a thread to give other closeted BPDs the open air market to spill grievances and just absolutely fucking vent especially y all younger than me Anyway here is my BPD soliloquy litany because I m absolutely tired of being ashamed This is probably going to be mostly in Ghostface Killah lyrics stream of consciousness language but also in list form Forgive the nonsense or lack of cohesiveness but I haven t expressed my feelings in two years out of pure fear of affecting another person s feelings or opinion of me Feel free to add to this thread 1 I m tired of the stigmatic framework around this diagnosis being a mental health death sentence 2 We aren t martyrs nor are we demons We are fucking humans 3 I have been physically abused by a partner as an adult as well as had pint glasses smashed over my back as a child I was sexually abused on the back of a Greyhound bus by an uncle when I was four years old I was neglected by a mother consistently for 4 years left to take care of an infant overnight sometimes until 5 AM I was the absolutely top of my class through grade school the whole way through to middle school while moonlighting as a babysitter to a toddler I fed myself from ages 7 10 left alone in a house in a fairly shitty neighborhood night in and night out I ve escaped through second story windows to get to payphone after watching my mother be slammed naked through glass coffee tables These are the implicit reasons I am a fucked up adult 4 I loved a boy very very deeply and obsess with him as an adult He was my boyfriend from 12 21 He was the only person that ever showed me solace and kindness I treated him like dogshit He s very successful in my eyes and a beautiful person I need to stop looking I still love the shit out of him 5 After my ex fiance dumped me I lost it so bad I was arrested by the Georgia State Police for a suicide attempt turned me completely losing my mind on three officers That led to an involuntary commitment Georgia practically still runs sanitariums Do not go to the bin in Georgia 6 I have been hospitalized 6 times One was a real suicide attempt one was an attempt I got caught on two were psychosis the others I really just couldn t deal with real life I ve been hospital free for two years My treatment is emotional isolation now I m not sure which is more ineffective 7 I stay in bed when I don t have to work 70 percent of the time 8 I stopped making art because I feel like the identity and aesthetic that I have to offer that feels genuine doesn t sync with my public persona and I am paralyzed in fear that no one will look at it with any reaction except poser or hack or trend slave or something of the ilk Realistically I m actually fairly talented 9 On top of being borderline I also have a skin combing addiction and I m an alcoholic I haven t fucked someone sober in years 10 I blacked out every night for a year and a half It s pretty foul I want to knock all of this shit off I m actually quite talented and I m fairly pretty I think I m articulate and charming I want a ritualistic regulation I want to read Proust I want to be kind to a lover but the arrow of time in one direction I suppose Prayers for everyone to channel their thin skins for you see truths the norms don t You ll just never ever be able to communicate them if you don t get your shit together Alms to start to get your shit together fellow BPDs Love yourself somehow even if you suck because we re all going to fucking die anyway and this self torture and debasement isn t worth it Someone probably treated you like dogshit when your brain wasn t developed Some shits not your fault Some shits TOTALLY your fault Cheers to the path to navigate the difference I m tired of silence I m tired of not expressing my feelings because I question every single one wondering if it s real If we don t express we can t seek truth Balance y all Let s all find balance,Suicidal Reference
I was wondering if anyone here has some experience with hearing voices and how to deal with it I ve been doing really well cutting back self harm lately with the help of a support worker In just a few months I ve gone from cutting scarily deep every single day to more superficial cuts maybe once a week something I m super proud of and never thought would happen But recently I ve had quite a lot on and been getting quite stressed and I ve found myself getting into these funks sometimes where it starts with a detached feeling like I m in a bubble that s a barrier between me and the rest of the world Later the self harm cravings come and when if I try to ignore them I ve started hearing a voice sort of whispering muttering my name over and over and encouragement to hurt myself I recognise that it s not real but it gets to me especially feeling so detached and only stops when I self harm it feels like the cutting bursts the bubble and everything goes back to normal I spoke to the nurse at the end of my group today about it and he s going to speak to my CPN and psychiatrist and my quetiapine will probably be raised I m a bit nervous about this though because I m already taking a pretty high dose Also since coming home and reflecting I can t help feeling that maybe I ve made all of this up maybe it didn t actually happen it all just seems so impossible,Suicidal Reference

So I finally met someone who I thought would understand me and we had been together since late December longest relationship by a significant amount most fizzle out in the first month or two but she started asking me why I didn t like to talk about my past I don t like lying to people but I knew that me having BPD had scared off all my other girlfriends or at the very least been a factor since they ll read the wikipedia page and think i m some crazy freak thanks internet So long story short I explained to her why I have so many scars self harm in the past she had never pried too hard in the past and I went on to explain BPD to her and how it fucked up my teens and early adulthood pretty badly would rather not go into specifics here would take a long time to go through everything At the time she seemed understanding but I could tell something was off Anyway after the talk I left her place and went on the rest of my day feeling like a dead many walking It s been a week and she hasn t messaged me i ve tried a few times but it s pretty clear to me the girl who a week ago was saying she loved me and cared about me and just wanted to know what I was afraid to talk about is gone And my friends ask me why I have trust issues I m so fucking done with this shit,Suicidal Reference

I don t know what to say or how to give back story I don t even really know what happened today during another breakdown All I know is I hit myself on the head over and over again with my fists and air freshener can Now I feel like I m going to die because the other night I saw on TV how a girl got hit in the head and then she had a seizure and died So now that s going to happen to me My head feels really cloudy and I don t feel real I m not sure if that s because my girlfriend left for work while I was in the middle of dissociating and now I m dissociating alone and I m not used to that Or I m dying I almost don t want to die So heres the point to this thread Does anyone else feel like they are dying if their support leaves them mid dissociation,Suicidal Reference

Aged 20 I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 Borderline Personality and ADHD for a few years These labels whatever they may be mean have afflicted me with a crippling set of problematic symptoms I m prone to meltdowns suicide attempts self harm social isolation and running away I ve moved around quite a bit in my life 24 times in 20 years I ve found myself living in the city the hood the suburbs the boondocks and everything in between I never was given the chance to assimilate into a single school system or circle of friends for very long At age 12 I began smoking wit cigawettes and toking on sensimilla bless I chose to skip school everyday and go home and get high My grades drooped but I did have a strong group of homies for the two years I stayed at that school Aged 13 I began writing graff Skipping school and making F grades to pursue my addictions I was expelled Me my young sister I m her senior by 10 years and mother moved to an even more rough part of town For 8th grade I was bullied almost everyday but stuck with a few white kids two brothas and one latino boy We had each others backs sold drugs and would smoke blunts at recess At night I went out and did graffiti aaand somehow I made honor roll because I would pay attention in class and not cause trouble That was enough for an A at this school because most of my peers were stealing from each other having sex in the locker room causing fights and bringing weapons to school I was set to go to the high school in this area but my mother thought it too dangerous The gang members who went there were no joke There were metal detectors and cops I wasn t afraid because I had my lil crew of nerdy hoodrats to run with Still living in the hood about a stones throw from downtown my ma opted to put me in online school ECOT This is when my mental health started to deteriorate significantly I only turned on the computer they provided me one time After that it was all down hill My connections to cannabis had dried up so I searched for legal highs online I came across DXM I began shoplifting it everyday I would drinking 1 2 four Oz bottles of Robitussin and disappear from home for days while I walked around my city in a stupor painting graffiti wherever I went I used what little money I had for bus trips to the train yard or new parts of town to conquer I filled the void of having no friends with this manic and risky behaviour It put a lot of tension on me and my mom s relationship Eventually we moved another time because I was booted from the ECOT program This time it was from the city to tha burbz It was culture shock for me I was placed in a nice suburban highschool where I didn t know anyone I was acting so crazy and drugged out by this point that even when I tried to make friends they thought I was crazy and shied away from my antics I just gave up man Started skipping every single day and smoking JWH drinking tussin popping diphenhydramine I was never at school and got truancy charge after truancy charge I spent a lot of my time at my moms in the basement on the computer talking on drug forums and IRC chats or out getting into trouble Eventually I was expelled yet again and sent to live with my father who is an ex junkie and LSD head His mental problems were still there despite being clean We lived together near the city in a crackhead alcoholic s basement I went insane We had roach and bed bug infestations My father plays instruments so he would be blaring some music really loud 24 7 in this little 4 room basement I had no friends and didn t even consider getting my GED or a job I was too busy doing what I was doing Making rap music and beats 24 7 drinking tussin alcohol going to the library painting playing computer games etc Well I did have some friends Online on my cough syrup drinking internet I met a girl there She wrote something on the forum I didn t even know what she looked like but as I read more of her posts I fell in love with her way with words The daughter of a well known poet I saw her pictures and fell in love Adorable petite and wearing a short bobcut of ever changing wacky colorings I began to flirt with her and she seemed to really enjoy me and loved my music but she had a fiance so I just sorta kept it in the back of my mind Maybe a year after meeting she had disappeared for a while She returned and I learned that she was single AND would be coming to my town I immediately asked if she wanted to meet for coffee or something She obliged We met at a coffee shop bar with her and her friend Hung out a bit and that was that Really hit it off A month or so later she was bugging me to visit her at her home just one state over It took a while but I got a ride there I didn t really think anything would happen She was 23 and I was 19 She was surely too good for me She was the one who initiated or rather made it glaringly obvious that she was down enough for me to make the first move She pretty much seduced me When I arrived at her home she lives a state away this was the second time meeting we really hit it off She smiled and laughed at the things I said and playfully hit me on the arm a few times Later in the day she showed me a bondage collar that she d recently ordered and made me put it on her She was fixing some wires for the TV so we could watch Netflix and bent down in a really erotic way We went on a walk and sat under a tree and she just had this spark in her eye so I akwardly kissed her reeled back and said like a dope Sorry I m not so experienced with this it was my first kiss ever but I tried again and we actually made out pretty passionately and I tried my best to not be all sloppy We went back inside and you know the rest I don t think I d have had the courage otherwise to engage on that level had she not be the one to initiate I think she knew that I m not all that socially perceptive and she had to really put on some obvious cues It was pretty wonderful and I m glad I lost my virginity to someone I loved as a friend I didn t tell her beforehand I was virgin and when I finally did she didn t believe me saying I didn t think I was taking a man s virginity AT ALL but I grew very embaressed of lying to her and lost contact She got married to another man and I was heartbroken I began self harming slashing up my legs and arms I tried to kill myself twice Landed in the psychward twice did group therapy tried out different drugs I was drinking heavily I just really wanted to die It wasn t solely because of that but it helped snowball a lot of depression from other things like friendlessness and feeling like a loser for dropping out but later on she broke up with that guy and we began talking again She wanted to get out of where she was at and so did I We planned to take a plane to CA to rubber tramp around and meet online friends and couch surf but of course she changed her mind I was heartbroken again and questioned my worth very much I went months of just barely existing until last month I had had it and ODd again It was the worst experience of my life Serotonin Syndrome to the max I seized and seized out of my bed Flung myself onto the floor and had horrible dyskensia My limbs flailed about as I vomited all over myself and the floor I lay on all night I rolled around unable to speak hallucinating for 8 hours I couldn t do anything If I tried to get up I would go barreling into my surroundings I knocked over almost all the small furniture in my room over the course of the night My mom found me in the morning and I was just barely able to slur out that I was trying to kill myself She insisted I go to the hospital but I just simply could not I was about to pass out from exaughstion and my limbs did not permit me to even take baby steps without crashing into something I had to crawl I had double vision so I couldn t see very well I was slurring and still vomiting here and there All I did was lay in bed for about 3 days It was the by far the worst time of my life and all because I was sad I couldn t be with a girl even if she was my first and only love So that was about 1 and 1 2 month ago Now I m just trying get by with the loneliness I feel like a loser a lot of the time I m 20 years old I never went to high school really No GED No license I live wit ma dukes I don t have friends I ve never gone out to concerts or bars or gone on dates or anything like that I m just a total loser and pariah who sits on the computer for 18 hours a day I fear that I will wake up when I m 30 and still be here I wish I could go to college or work a job or something but I don t really think I m good enough Well I just sorta spilled my guts I dunno Take from that what you will,Suicidal Reference
so uh i was diagnosed with borderline traits about three years ago i m not 18 yet will be in July though so i assume thats why it s just traits But anyways ive been in and out of mental hospitals since 2012 there were a lot of factors i had an emotionally abusive boyfried my mom and i werent getting along and then when my mom passed away at the end of 2013 I moved in with my grandmother who ive hated ever since i can remember she was the only family member who would take me in she told lies to get me sent into another residential facility and I got out in october She didnt want to take me back in but my ex step dad stepped up and took me in its been better and i was happy for a good while I stop taking my meds in november i stopped going to therapy in december honestly not by my choice though my step dad wont set up any appointments even though i keep asking i even got a really cool boyfriend about a month ago things have been going great But thats why im so confused as to why i feel like total crap all the time for about the past two weeks i just get incredibly sad and i dont know why sometimes i think about cutting myself again which i havent been struggling with as much as i used to ive relapsed 4 times since March of last year and other times i think about just completely offing myself and i try to talk to my boyfriend about it but he just doesnt get it and he just says think positive or today i said i felt like cutting and the thought wouldnt go away no matter what and he said that he would do it deeper if i did it that made me feel even worse he doesnt have a history of self harming at least to my knowledge So yeah i dont really know what to do i might be getting a therapy appointment scheduled soon so thats a thing but idk i need advice for the now i guess,Suicidal Reference
I was on Celexa for years and went off during my pregnancy and for almost a year after it and just started again I still saw my therapist through the time I was off of it and I did struggle a lot But I m not sure I was struggling any more than when I was on it I m still adjusting I ve only been back on for 6 days so I know I shouldn t expect anything I also am perscribed Xanax for anxiety which only helps for the moment but I know makes me suicidal in the long run Does anyone on here deal with their BPD without any medication Still go to therapy Think they do better off meds Definitely looking for advice,Suicidal Reference

I know many of you have had very similar experiences so I needed to vent a bit to you guys Sorry if I sound a bit weird or curt in how I write as I get a bit dissociative when I am stressed and just sort of stream of consciousness everything out Anyways here goes I m in the UK where NHS resources for mental health are at breaking point I know this I know my support workers duty workers key workers there are so many different terms I don t even know who is who have other people to deal with also and when they say they can t speak to me or they ll see me next time it s not because they hate me and are rejecting me but because they have lots of other people who need help But I can t help but feel like I m being treated slightly differently because of my diagnosis of BPD I know many of us have issues with boundaries but generally I am now at the point where I have shut myself off and do not reach out at all But when I do reach out I feel rejected Last Saturday I was admitted to A amp E after an episode of psychosis I was physically violent towards people had to be restrained I remember NONE of it I feel so guilty My friend had to sit in the ambulance with me and in hospital with me and apparently I kept trying to hit her I was out for a good while and by the time I had woken up she had gone home I didn t even know she stayed with me in hospital as I said I remember nothing I was on my own in the hospital having lost my phone no idea why I was there A nurse came over when I woke up at about 2pm the next day and told me that I had said I wanted to kill myself and asked if I wanted to speak to the psychiatric team at the hospital I said yes I then went out for a cigarette and told the person behind the desk at the ward that I was just nipping out for a cigarette and I d be back Some guy comes up to me and snaps actually we re discharging you I mean what the hell I have just been told I m a danger to myself and now you re discharging me The rest of the week is a blur I go to my BPD group on Monday I go to my other group on Wednesday I had a bit of a breakdown and told my group leader about what had happened about the psychosis etc I think on Friday I was out somewhere and I told my friend I wanted to kill myself He insisted on taking me to A amp E and after how I ve been treated in A amp E I was all hell no and ran off My friends called the police Being chased down the street by the police is scary as shit But they were more helpful After some persuasion I went willingly and sat in the car with a support worker they called to come and talk to me They said if I had ran off they would have had to section me They took me to stay with my friend where I was safe I spent most of this weekend in bed Due to the fact that I somehow don t seem to be able to function until 9pm most days I didnt get to sleep last night and I missed my last BPD group today I was phoned by a support worker who told me to contact that team and explain that I m sorry I missed the last session we re expected to attend all of them or we don t get any more help and I was told that they don t plan on having anything more to do with me basically I just feel like shit I mean I ve gotten worse and worse I ve reached out for help and I just feel like it s being thrown back in my face I know that my feelings don t necessarily represent reality but I really just needed to write this down and get it out Thanks if you read this I know it s a bit of a jumble but yeah Arghhhhhh I m moving house tomorrow and havent even started packing yet My financial situation is in ruin I can t focus at university I can t work because of my anxiety my impulsive behaviour is out of control I just want to see a psychiatrist again who can reassess me and give me some medical evidence to submit because my symptoms have got a LOT LOT worse and I need this medical evidence to apply for financial help I know I am difficult to deal with because I m always in flux but I just wish people would understand,Suicidal Reference
So I met this guy and me and him connected right off the bat He s so awesome and a really great friend so far But as I got to know him I saw too much of myself in him and he opened up to me about being beaten and molested as a child has self harm issues and watching the way he interacted with his girlfriend which has BPD too made me suspect he may be suffering from BPD as well I brought it up and asked if he d ever looked over the criteria Later that day he did the online test and scored a 45 and didn t really know how to handle it He was in crisis mode and that was compounded by his girlfriend being very insensitive I stayed up with him on the phone all night cause he was suicidal and cutting himself I really want to help him the best I can I ve already referred him to some DBT stuff online and I shared some of my strategies for coping too But the problem is he can t seek professional help due to funds and the fact that he s moved to another town while on probation and he ll be screwed unless he visits a hospital in his original county But none of those hospitals offer DBT services or even an inpatient psyche ward like the one I stayed at Is there anything else I can do for him I just want to help him as much as i can because he doesn t have a very good support network help,Suicidal Reference

I was diagnosed when I was 18 been seeing psychiatrists a long time and have a whole list of diagnoses I had supposedly had before the decided to brand me with BPD I ve managed to stay my way through university and I ve been a qualified psychiatric nurse for over a year so I m obviously keeping it well in My main symptoms are generally intense anxiety paranoia some auditory hallucinations The mood swings were never a massive problem for me anyway everyone I spoke to about it always told me I had some anger issues but I personally never found myself to be angry So two weekends ago my boyfriend had to phone the police because something in me just absolutely snapped and I ended up smashing most things in our kitchen and being a general riot The week afterwards I was completely low contemplating suicide catatonic at times and reverted back to reckless driving and stuff like that I m now on a bit of a high pretty elated pressured speech a lot of paranoia But I ve found that when my mood goes down it will stay down for a prolonged period of time before it becomes back to swinging several times a day and then a nice period of stability I m kind of guessing this is me slowly getting the hang of this control thing I hear everyone go on about I m feeling all round pretty positive with what s been happening though and the progress The spell of anger and aggression did come out of the blue but I am pining that particular episode on hormones I ve recently had my IUD removed I d just thought I would share my happiness with other BPD ers rather than people who don t even know the first thing about it,Suicidal Reference
Yesterday I had a breakdown for the first time in months I asked my friend to talk to me she didn t reply Asked another friend to talk to me she didn t reply I asked my sister to talk to me She called me a sociopath Nothing really helped and right now I feel so stupid Like I want to hurt myself but for no reason other than to do it Being crazy sucks Just when I thought it was going away I snapped and probably should have been put on suicide watch by my parents,Suicidal Reference
Hello there guys my name is Lila and I m an artist I write poetry and play synth Two years ago I ve been diagnozed with BPD before I been diagnozed with OCD and Depression only and started taking pills for it Two years ago in an act of impulssive behaviour I sold everything left school and moved to the UK with my long time online boyfriend He coudn t cope with my depression and stress and I took my pills in a very irregular way he was good to me but he meant the life to me which isnt very healthy in a relationship he coudnt cope so he left me and I was on the streets alone in Europe so I had to came back on a rush home to South America a long way Since that life has been hell for me When I left I told all my so called friends that I was never going to be back so when I came back they didn t wanna see me I started having some weird paranoic behaviour and I coudn t stop calling him Every day every minute but since I left he never replied back NEVER I tried to kill myself and so I was on home rehab for two months I coudn t get out from the bed and the doctor tried every exisiting pill with me but it was getting worse and worse My doctor tried pipotiazine injection with me and it actually worked I was getting better but then again I cound t forget my ex boyfriend he was still meaning the world to me I sent him the most lovely letters ever emails phone calls lots of money for wasted international calls So pipotiazine actually worked and I made two friends at a party they are crazy as I am and I love them so that was a great thing that happened to me but we have ups and downs as I m not a great friend I had a couple issues with pills as I drank alcohol once and its totally forviden for my issue so I had a seizure a few actually It was scary it has always been my obsessive thoughts and my desire to die but never something physical In the end I havent had a relationship in two years I still write him sometimes even thought he never EVER replied I have art and my family keeps me alive but will I ever find my soulmate being so self destructive I want to know if any of you can give me some advice Should I lie about my personality and try to get them to know me as sane Or should I show me as I am Oh God it feels so good to take this off my chest and to actually share it with people with the same disorder Kindest regards Lila,Suicidal Reference
So I was stupid I studied in social work and yet I d let myself be in that relationship I have a borderline personnality disorder I have big problems with relationships I put the other person as an idol and I help them to my own end So I helped him he was throw out of the appartment he was couch surfing in I took him in He was great at first And he lost his job I had to support him alone He started working on tattoos with supplies I bought to help him He started trying to make me go away from my own apartment when he worked an appartment I paid alone because he wasn t paying his rent He started throwing stuff My appartment is now destroyed I need to change 2 doors 1 small closet door and patch holes and repainting He started pushing me He destroyed the doors a few times when I was hiding in the bathroom or my room He even broke one of my rib by kicking me with his foot in december On christmas eve I was in the hospital to see a doctor He knew I would always be on my knees so he would stay Because I was not protecting myself I told him a lot of time that I didn t feel well sleeping alone that if he planned on not getting home after the bar I would just want heads up so I would sleep at a friend s He started saying I was stupid and I would have to live with it He always stay very late at night coming back at 5 6am He never was on time And I didn t have any way to contact him He started stealing my debit card but he always said it was because he went to the groceries for us the day before He was angry that I was searching for him even when he had my card and I had no money to get something to eat and no idea when he came back He told me I just had to eat his leftovers even if I didn t like them When in the grocery he screamed at me when I refused to bought food I don t even eat for him One day he would tell me he loved me the next that I was the most horrible being He used my mental state to make me believe I was the one who was wrong Than I found about the stealing We took a break which he took with his new girl to whom he was saying he was single since 4 5 months When we talked back we bargain for a last try out week in which he would finish my tattoos to repay his stealing I put myself in debt I paid everything alone all year long he owes me around 6k even if he thinks his part of the appartment groceries and services are 3k for that year Than my friend found out that he was seeing that girl she didn t know at all about me I hope she dumped him I had to drop out university even if I was one of the best students No more money I ll have to get my ex job savings in my name to not have my electricity cut He never took a debt in his name I m the only one with finances destroyed it will take 2 years to have a judgment as I sue him I also called the police for the violence and the stealings It will also take time he can t talk to me but he broke in my appartment the police doesn t have any proof The police officer who got my case didn t respect my rights he broke his conditions by talking to me and she didn t want to take my complain She forced me to let him enter my appartment for his stuff my appartment being only in my name his stuff were already out at my door She didn t want to take the breaking in complain She let him insult me when he came for his stuff My lawyer will help me sue him for money in civil court So now I am doing webcams for money I hate it but I ll be bankrupt A guy even tried to extort me with the shows I gave him in private I also had to go to the police My life is fu He has no real consequences some people support him as he made me the crazy girl My friend was bein tattooed by my ex but even before we broken up he wasn t satisfied with the work and changed for another artist My ex wanted the money like if he finished told him he would come to his place and serves himself after that told him he would send someone to make him pay Today he was doing a garage sale in a local bar I asked my friend to go see if some of my stuff was there He didn t talked to him but told the girl who was there trying to sell him stuff that he was only checking for the stolen stuff he took from the ex he cheated on He wasn t happy and called the police lying about me sending people to treathen him Telling one of my friend said he would broke his legs Didn t even say a name So he s threatening my friend for the tattoos and fake that I m sendin people to do that to him It s too much I can t feel anything If I start to I won t be able to get back on my feet I just survive I m being destroyed inside All that while I m supposed to be relaxing after a cervix operation for my precancerous cells Also my sister is treating me like shit she cost me 25 when I don t even have money to eat because

I m older and have been mostly self managing my BPD for years now I know it s not the healthiest but can t afford a therapist I was doing really well though I went back to college and graduated with honors top of my class I think throwing myself into school was my therapy so I didn t have time to think about anything else But I graduated and now I feel like everything is going to shit I can t find a real job grad school doesn t start till fall and the job market is soul crushing And then there s my partner I m F she s transitioning MtF We spontaneously eloped 4 5 years ago moved in together a year later and everything was always so amazing between us She was the end all be all love of my life for years if never been so happy She moved into my place rent and bill free for the next 2 years Then she started dating someone else behind my back and my world fell apart All of my BPD came back I started cutting and self medicating again I saw the other girl in public and feel like my brain broke in that instant and it s hurt in my brain ever since A year after that is when she announced her transition I totally support her and stand by it 100 but the changes have been hard especially on top of recovering from her cheating The last few months though she s been increasingly distant and a few days ago decided she wants to leave She misses being single and wild and free and thinks I m guilting her into staying in our marriage The amount I can t handle this is unfathomable I ve been crying and cutting and staring down a pill bottle for so long I don t know if I m going to take them all or just brush everything off pick myself up yet again and rebuild I m making an appointment with a counselor on Monday but frankly I m scared of counsellors Ugh I just had to vent about this to people who might understand I feel like I m losing everything and I m getting too old for this shit Is anyone else older and still battling BPD,Suicidal Reference
I m 16 year old female I currently have a diagnosis of anxiety disorder but I found the Evolving BPD note in my records In the past I have dealt with cutting myself I didn t use it as a coping mechanism I did it because I liked to LOOK at the cuts on my skin after they had healed a bit Its was weird But i m over that phase now and if I even attempt to cut myself now To feel something other than anxiety I actually feel disturbed and guilty that i m harming my body I have these episodes where I get suicidal for months then I have an average mood for months then I get suicidal again Sometimes I feel ecstatic and on top of the world but it never lasts more than a day Its the best feeling ever Right now i m deeply depressed and have been for about 4 days I threaten suicide often Its like a coping mechanism for me knowing I always have the option Its been like this for 2 years now I think the self harm and suicide threats contributed a lot to the diagnosis I get angry VERY easily and break down a lot I am always on edge I am extremely judgmental towards my family everything they do annoys me and there is a lot of tension in my house because of my anger My dad often tells me he doesn t give a shit how I feel he wants me to leave etc When I was hospitalized I wanted to feel safe and taken care of When I came off of 24 7 suicide watch and another girl my age got put on one at first I felt jealous that I didn t have a nurse right beside me anymore although I got over it once we became friends But when I heard the nurses and her talking laughing conversing I felt EXTREME anger and wanted to just yell shut the fuck up I felt like all the nurses liked her more I m questioning the Evolving BPD because I don t fit the full criteria I have frequent suicidal thoughts yes I USED to self harm I never feel empty inside I have no fear of abandonment Not even sure what abandonment is classified as in this case I don t have dangerous impulsive behaviour Such as sex drugs spending etc I have superficial mood swings but in reality how i m feeling never changes I m always anxious or on edge and I think the moods come from the anxiety getting higher lower I think I may have traits but I don t believe I have the evolving actual disorder because i ve been mentally ill since I was 5 or 6 I ve had a fairly good childhood Besides the crippling anxiety I wasn t neglected or abused What do you think I should do,Suicidal Reference
My girlfriend is one of the most kind and understanding people I know but she just doesn t understand my depression Whenever I talk to her about it she goes on about how she must not be good enough to make me happy and that makes her sad I ve also been extremely depressed lately and suicidal but I know I can t talk to her about that either She knows I used to be suicidal and it would break her heart if I told her I still am and it would make her cry which I can t stand I m so desperate and lost and I wish I could talk to her and make her understand but I just don t know how Also does anyone else feel a sense of abandonment whenever someone important in their life doesn t talk to them Whenever I m alone I get sad and my thoughts consume and I just end up crying something I ve been doing often as of late I just wish this would all end I don t know who I can talk to about this,Suicidal Reference
I ve struggled with depression for the majority of my teen and adult years and about a year ago I was finally tested and diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder For the most part I have it under control now after having attempted suicide two years ago and being in some intense DBT I ve been with my boyfriend since around the same time of my diagnosis Over the past year he has broken up with me twice and taken it back whether it be after a few weeks or a few days and in a crying panic We live together and I never planned to move out until this last time I have my own room although it s pretty much just a place I keep my shit He has major mood swings and reminds me of myself He gets really depressed and has actually once been caught in the bathroom with a razor to his wrist and i tackled him and choked him until he dropped it and stayed home with him that day I spoke to my therapist she told me to call the police but I didn t He punches holes in the walls but never directs his violent behaviors towards me ever He s a great guy in general and I love him with all I ve got He s never talked down to me he never makes me feel anything less than great even when he breaks up with me he explains its about him and he feels like he s holding me back from achieving my goals BUT I think maybe we are destructive to each other Maybe I m hurting him and maybe I am bringing out his depression with my own problems Borderline people and I hate to say this tend to really suck life out of people At least I know I do Or I feel like that My therapist tells me otherwise but y know My life is based around abandonment issues you know that s my whole thing so I feel like I stay in situations just because it s comfortable and maybe I am causing him more problems because I don t have the guts to really leave him and force him to take a good look at himself I mean I actively work on my mental illness so why shouldn t he I am medicated and I do stupid fucking anxiety exercises and I think before I speak 99 9 of the time And how do you tell someone who gets angry or argues everything this I can t tell him anything without him taking it as we have to break up or something OR IS IT JUST ME BEING IRRATIONAL BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF MY THOUGHTS ARE I feel like I am losing my brain I am also new here this is my first post Thanks for reading,Suicidal Reference

OK Im self diagnosed as BPD Now my life makes sense I had an assessment yesterday but the counselor wasn Äôt qualified enough to diagnose me as BPD but to me its clear i am My life story is crazy but it makes sense now 3 degrees never worked outside the house gambling drinking traveling one night stands is a summary Im male british asian and 30 years old was heavily abused in childhood emotionally and physically by my dad and possibly sexually by a teacher My life has recently descended into a whole new level of chaos in the last 6 months it was always kind of chaotic I ve finally figured it is to do with an intense relationship i had while traveling in october time it was only 7 weeks but by any standards intense albeit undefined I stuck around only for this girl in the respective country she had fallen for me too a bit and I treated her extremely well I left when on a drunken night out she said she didnt consider kissing cheating and quickly kissed a friend of hers who apologised immediately she recently explained when i brought this up 3 months later she was drunk and being stupid and would have made it up to me if I had brought it up earlier It hurt and even though I didnt bring it up then as an issue not acknowledging my feelings or wanting to make a big deal out of it she knew I was a bit of a playboy and relationships were rare to me she knew I was pissed off over something I thought about it the next day and decided it was time for me to head home as a result she was in tears I came back home very soon was a bit upset over her but also my gambling losses on the trip but nothing major for a couple weeks she was constantly contacting me on facebook I was primarily concerned with solving my gambling issues and making some money from it but ended up cleaning myself out and getting myself into debt She flew out to the UK to visit me before christmas I was reluctant but hadnt been out much and guess missed her a bit and wanted sex I guess I made no commitment to her on this visit and kept up my image of having not too much feelings But I started to panic over the last few weeks when it was clear she was moving on and her messages on facebook became infrequent though she messaged me when she wanted an ego boost And She has to tell me last week shes seeing someone else and is now gonna do a LDR with this dude this has ruined me Even though I lied that ive also moved on to new pastures Ive not been with a single girl since and barely outside the house In a number of ways I have been stalking her facebook messaging her with daft things and trying to get at her I guess which I did in some ways In fact my life is that pathetic that I have literally spent more time in my room doing not much of anything for the best part of 3 months barely eating occasionally venturing out when The resulting abandonment issues from this are killing me at times im so f g hurt at times the pain is intolerable occasionally The thought of her f g some other guy her using me as an emotional crutch while she was f g him why me My heart literally is breaking alot of the time Why didnt I recognise sooner that this was how I am Why Why Why I treated her well amazingly dont think she can ever forget that I cant even understand this at all Ive had 50 one night stands sexual flings and only one proper relationship before that resulted in even greater issues when we split though it was 2 years long I was close to killing myself then but I did a course of hypnoanalysis and it worked miracles if I could afford this now Id give it a go and if something were to happen to me I will recommend the therapy to other BPD sufferers its hit and miss I believe Im still happy I didnt kill myself then cause Ive did so much since namely the traveling My life basically consists of chain smoking all day and lying in bed most days Why did this have to happen Im not a bad person these days my anger issues are at myself mainly and now her why isnt god helping me Im the first to admit before my therapy 5 years ago I was not a nice person but since then Ive changed a lot I have no one to talk to I cant tell my family this is to do with this girl and am shocked I feel like this they believe its down to the gambling issues and so did I for a while and sometimes do until this girl had moved on Please pray for me Ive calmed down a bit since writing this because I can clearly acknowledge what went wrong with her was at least partially my fault but the hurt keeps coming back Very confused painting her black and white all the time WTF is happening Ive been reading up non stop on BPD but have found nothing that can help in this situation Everyone is so negative about this disorder but up until we parted no doubt she wanted a relationship with me but I was the reluctant one I know I shouldnt even be considering someone like this and her me in some ways though honestly I did treat her amazingly well albeit she was is nice enough but clearly jumping from guy to guy she has issues herself I idealized her for sure I really dont know reddit users my mum and brother love me to bits and i guess its that which has stopped me from killing myself they are suffering from seeing me like this My poor mum has even offered to help with my debts despite us being relatively poor financially But im not sure how much more of this I can take I would give anything to go back 6 months I had everything I wanted a few thousand pounds enough for me my sanity peace of mind I was traveling meeting people having enough fun with plenty of women not the suicidal mess I am now Even if I hadnt gambled my money I could have done a quick trip abroad to ease my mind Not working nothing no motivation to do anything a lot of the time No drinking or gambling either for the past 2 weeks im tempted to do the former though tonight but ill resist Though god knows feels like the end at times Its like I m waiting to die in many ways I feel a lot better for writing this out and thank all from the bottom of my heart for reading this Advice views appreciated And is there any hope for me in this life Im currently awaiting a referral for therapy and taking 50mg setraline but the mood swings are insane still as I guess the writing shows,Suicidal Reference

My boyfriend 24 and I 20F have been together almost a year I absolutely despise his son 1 5 y o partially because his mother is a psycho that harasses my boyfriend and I and partially because I can t handle sharing the attention Every time my boyfriend spends time with his son which is always at his ex s house because she won t let us take him and hopes if he s around her he will want her back which he never will she s crazy I get so jealous that I end up taking a bunch of Valium and self harming We are moving out of state soon and I can t help but hope he loses the custody battle so I never have to deal with the ex or share time with the kid again He is adorable and sweet and he loves me but I can t look past the fact that he isn t mine I just want him out of my life so we can have our own family free of drama I know this sounds so selfish but I figured if anyone understands me here it s you all on this sub How do you guys deal with sharing your SO s time with their loved ones Can I fix how I feel,Suicidal Reference

Hey I ve been in therapy for depression PTSD and anxiety plus potential BPD for a few weeks Twice a week Just gonna vent a bit I ve been telling my boyfriend and friends that I haven t had the guts to call a therapist yet That s a lie I did it in case I didn t get better so they wouldn t think I was a failure Which is obvious now because I am not getting better After some appointments this week my boyfriend confronted me and said I need to get help or he s leaving The issue is I have been I m trying hard to fix myself but if anything I feel worse Suicidal thoughts are showing up more and more cutting is a bigger thought in my mind and I keep skipping classes and spending the time crying instead I don t know what to do I m stuck here I m stuck I have no give on either side and I ve cried so much about it that I can t even bother to put emotion in this post,Suicidal Reference

I just discovered this subreddit so I am going to use it to vent perhaps get some feedback from others who could be more understanding Firstly I was diagnosed almost a year ago after years of depression and anxiety stemming from childhood sexual abuse and emotional neglect I was raped multiple times as a child unfortunately by people in my life meant to be father figures I sought out love and protection from guys who only saw a vulnerable girl to take advantage of This led to me getting hurt emotionally and eventually pregnant at 15 After being forced to abort I started going to therapy to try and repair what I felt was broken To make matters worse however I d been a victim of bullying in middle school and it continued onto high school I went to an all girls school and didn t have a close set of friends Gossip and rumors spread around which only made me feel more alone At 16 I tried to kill myself and was admitted to a psych ward for a night after I told my guidance counselor I did therapy on and off for years until I started college A part of my therapy however was trying to repair my relationship with my mom Growing up even before what happened to me my mother was never really affectionate nor loving she always cared more about her then common law husband amp his kids than having a meaningful relationship with me For years I hated her because she made me get an abortion and I believe she hated s me because I ruined her marriage She walked in on her then common law husband sexually assaulting me stayed with him despite the fact then changed when he left Almost a decade later the relationship I have with my mother is still very complicated I have learned not to really depend on my mother for anything as she feels she isnt obligated to care for me but she still is very much a trigger for me She mocks my BPD my appearance my relationships makes me feel worthless and broken I cope by impulsively consistently smoking weed and playing video games all day rather than going out and facing the real world I suffer from irrational anger constantly so much so that I had to break up with my boyfriend because I was taking it out on him and although he was and still is incredibly supportive I cant possibly stay in a relationship when I clearly don t love myself I romanticize everything play out fantasies in my mind with people I am not at all romantically sexually involved with in which we fall in love through sex go through some exaggerated dramatic event then live happily ever after married and expecting It always goes to that and I know it isnt healthy I know it stems from my childhood trauma amp I am not sure how to get out of it I am constantly depressed now stuck in a rut of blaming myself for being raped by my father unloved by my mother I have lots of friends but I don t hang out with people Or if I do have plans I almost always flake out don t feel pretty enough don t feel well adjusted enough Anyone else going through this or went through this Is there any coming out of it,Suicidal Reference
I ve had an especially tough few weeks but the past couple days I ve felt better and stupidly thought the bad patch had passed and I would be fine Then today one little thing happens and I realise how foolish I was to think I d ever be better or escape the torture that is my own mind I ve spent the morning proactively trying to organise my work load for the coming week I figured as long as I stuck to my schedule I d be fine I planned to go out at 1pm to get supplies and crack on I had to pop onto Facebook to check on a stupid game that I usually play on my phone but need to go onto the laptop to make trades Well that s it I spent the next 40mins trying to make sure all of the notifications down the side were empty instead of how they are when you get a little number next to them for unread updates That s why I do my best to avoid laptop Facebook at all costs Now I m an hour and a half behind schedule as I spent the next half hour crying and trying not to SH go to drink because I just collapsed and my brain won Like how stupid am I to think I can organise myself and keep myself busy so that everything will be great Obviously I m just too fucked up to handle even the most simple things This is all very self deprecating and pathetic which I ve recently been told by an ex friend is highly unattractive so I apologise for that I just didn t know where else to rant,Suicidal Reference
It could all end right here 5 steps away from the easiest way out a quick jump over a balcony barrier and it s done with A 12 story fall to a concrete pavement below Everything would be gone A prior wipe to a laptop and a phone maybe just a break of them as well No proof of any suffering Not a single person would know the pain Not a single person would know anything It would be confusing of course It seems that not a single mistake or misstep has ever been made in this life People wouldn t understand and people always need to understand It wouldn t be difficult to make it seem as though a secret slipping of drugs occurred as well as a terrible reaction It s happened before People believe it A faultless death A perfect painting can make even a war torn wall seem beautiful There would still be joy within the sorrow It would all be over And no one would ever know The carried burden would end Like watching a bird finally being released after living a lifetime in a cage Beautiful,Suicidal Reference
Holy shit Just got back from throwing a bullpen with the largest demon in my life my father I m a 17 year old pitcher diagnosed with BPD this early because of the severity of my problems I don t feel like going into too much detail on my past with my father But until I was 14 he was constantly physically and verbally abusing me for my performance or lack thereof on the baseball diamond I didn t see really see him much when I was younger other than through baseball but he was always abusing me He stopped for the most part after my coach at the time told him to back the fuck off when I showed up to the game with very noticeable bruises on my face My father hasn t lived with us for several years living more or less 40 minutes away with his new family and baby mama that he cheated on my mom with Oh yeah he is diagnosed NPD as well as my sister who lives with him Anyways all the shit he did to me brought out the BPD in me as well as make me develop a huge chip on my shoulder and a desire to please just to make the pain stop even if the pain isn t there anymore I am a very skilled pitcher throwing in the mid high 80s when healthy but my movement and my changeup are my strengths I had to throw with him tonight because the season is fast approaching and I don t have anyone else to throw with He started almost immediately with me I called him out on all the bullshit that he did to me and how fucked up it made me in the head He then proceeded to say that he did me a favor by being so hard on me Look at where you are now He said Look at your fuck up retard of a brother He has all the talent in the world in basketball but he doesn t have the drive or the aggressiveness that I implanted in you because I was told to stop or I was going to jail Your brother isn t going to do shit in this world because I didn t push him You know if you aren t appreciative you can go fuck yourself I did you a favor and thats the only way you have a chance at going to college is because I taught you to work hard for baseball I whipped around and threw a fastball at his head he ducked and my arm started to hurt I tried throwing a couple more throws but each one lessened in speed and I couldn t hit the broad side of a barn I think I may have messed something up in my elbow as my hand and elbow are now tingling Of course this could just be my brain making up an injury to convince me to sit out the spring and be ready for the much more important summer But if it is a real injury and it is what I think it may be torn UCL this could be what ruins me It seems like every time I m with my father something shitty like this happens Last year I broke my elbow because of him with only a few days before the season started The year before I threw out my back running away from him before the summer season started and missed all of June I ve been concussed several times in his care because of car crashes when he was driving or he hit me or I hurt myself running away from him But the feeling that set in as I was driving away from his den of Evil wasn t hatred It wasn t anger I felt like I was drowning I started crying I wanted to puke I felt like this because I am worried that my future is gone because of another injury I was driving on windy roads and several times got the urge to hit the gas and crash my car I closed my eyes several times I felt similar to the way I did when I tried to crash my car back in the fall to kill myself except this feeling lasted much longer It was the longest time that I ve been on that edge I was listening to Tech N9ne s Drowning and it perfectly described how I was feeling I m feeling a little better I m about to turn on Scrubs on netflix but I walked in the door maybe 15 minutes ago and my mom said I looked like a part of me just died I don t have any friends I can turn to I don t meet with my therapist till the weekend and I just feel like absolute shit I m behind on my schoolwork because of the rut I m in but I don t feel like I have it in me to do it Sorry for such a long post I m just felt like I m drowning and I didn t have anywhere else to turn,Suicidal Reference

I know splitting is a symptom of BPD but I ve never really split on someone The closest I ve gotten that I can think of is when my relationship with someone I m romantically involved with is in danger I keep holding that person to the highest standard telling myself they had their reasons for getting upset at me and that they were in the right to get angry at me sad whatever But I think I take the negative part of the splitting out on myself because I yell at myself stuff like You re a terrible person you should die no one will ever love you you re going to be hated forever and they re going to leave you for someone better etc It only gets that bad when a stressor on my relationship triggers my thinking of all that stuff or when I get in a depressed mood But other than that I m pretty okay with myself and I ll start to think maybe I deserve to be happy and be loved then something triggers the splitting and I ll put myself down to the lowest degree I can Sorry I know that the explanation isn t entirely reperesenting the title but I can t think of a better term to describe what I say to myself Maybe it isn t even splitting so much as it is incredibly low self esteem but I feel like it s splitting,Suicidal Reference

I won t get too long here I d been dating this girl for 2 months knew her 4 months ago talked everyday and started dating 2 months ago We already acted like a couple but last night I decided to get things straight and confirm that we re exclusive She agreed although with some hesitation in her voice But then only 4 hours after the meeting she sent me an instant message saying that she thinks she cannot be with me or anybody she s no good for anyone she always ruins relationships her last relationship was going fine for two years before she ended it for problems that only existed in her head and it s a pattern with every guy who s good to her She feels this DBT she s been going through is not helpful all day today she only thinks about wanting to die she s tired of all the headaches the voices the restraints to behave she s tired of herself healing isn t supposed to be painful So she asked me to reconsider our relationship but if she were me she wouldn t waste a potential lifetime only to be with someone like her FYI she s been in an episode of unprecedented mood fluctuations these past 3 days maybe that s relevant I m confused This is actually not really new because when we started dating she has voiced her concern that I wouldn t be able to handle her she couldn t even handle herself Please tell me what s your take on this Is this a sure sign for me to back off Or is it worth talking through What should I say in either scenario One thing I know my life would crash temporarily if we never talk again I already invested so much,Suicidal Reference

My girlfriend is currently going through some intense stuff She is about 2 months into no longer taking her medication for bi polar due to no insurance She is about 2 weeks into no longer taking birth control We haven t slept together in over a month due to her complete repulsion of sex or really any kind of intense intimacy She used to be pretty much insatiable the entire time I knew her while she was on her medications Her best friend also decided to move in with her abusive ex so she s effectively lost her biggest and longest lasting person of support to her previous abuser to which she still has deep emotional scars from She tells me that she s not good enough for me that she is just a disappointment and a poison to my life We will make plans and she will ditch them last minute and become inconsolable when I explain how that makes me feel She claims that she doesn t want to love me or feel this strongly anymore that she would rather be numb and sleep 16 hours a day She has been admitted to a psych ward less than a year ago under suicide watch and has brought up the fact that she is beginning to have those thoughts again I have tried to explain to her that her feelings are due to her no longer taking these medications and she seems to acknowledge that But she won t make any effort to go to planned parenthood to get birth control and has too strong of social anxiety to attempt to become a patient with a psychologist I m really at my wits end here I love her a lot but she seems to not want anyone to help her It s very clear to me the reason this is happening is the lack of drugs and I just want to help her get down the right path Any advice would be appreciated,Suicidal Reference
I have these automatic negative thought that has been with me for years Every time when I m in a awkward situation and I think about when i m alone there is like a voice within me that tells me to kill myself It happens when i m thinking back at a situation I can sudden hear my self saying Just kill yourself Commit suicide or You don t deserve to live It always happens if I think I m not good enough And these out loud thoughts also come with rush maybe kind of a anxiety attack And would never react to these thoughts I have been suicidal in the past but I m still stuck with this ghost I feel so weird about this and is very ashamed of it Has this happen to any of you Or have you heard of others,Suicidal Reference
I wrote this off of a prompt at a poets society meeting first time ive written something smoothly in months well here goes Prompt The stranger you meet in the sun shower The stranger you meet in the sun shower quaintly whispered several sounds into the hollow crevices which once held ears which could hear a nation fall in its conception yet fire already left them scorched and desolate your eyes glimpsed a purity through magnificent amber rays as you stepped further towards the unknown sillhouette perched upon the ledge overtop a seven story fall to his redemption the wrinkles upon your face mirrored the confusion of which the stranger wreaked as well as your tongue already tasting the desperation which dripped from his forehead as he quietly screached and cried to stop waking from every relived childhood afternoon drenched and drowning with his head still chained six feet under water your eyes refocused to the chain around the strangers neck As you now stared hm in the face you noticed a locket and with it the face which held him in fear and mourning He looked frightened but the desperation whisks away as he notices your eyes and inside sees upon his own face Mirrored in your beautiful brown eyes and for once sees that he is not at all a prisoner yet just imprisoned,Suicidal Reference

I have been feeling like a complete idiot in social situations I can t stop thinking about what not to say to keep my mouth shut so nothing dumb comes out of my mouth and past situations in which I have said or done something stupid at which I m sure people have cringed and over which I continue to berate myself Right now I m sitting at work trying to hold back tears because I am just so stupid and I want to kill myself when I get home but I wouldn t have the courage and have never allowed myself to come up with a set plan This is the latest social situation I ve been going over and over I was at a party Friday night I made out with someone for an hour in the living room around some other people until he decided it was time for him to leave I m 27 years old should I just be making out Should I be making myself go further The guy said he felt like he was in high school again it was nice to make my acquaintance he had a nice time But I can t stop thinking that I was wrong My other acquaintance friend pointed out we were just making out for an hour with kind of an accusatory that s odd tone Now that we re not teenagers that means we have an obligation to fuck Or I have an obligation to get him off Because everyone else at the party was fucking I enjoyed my time but I can t stop thinking that I didn t do the right thing and I m a huge weirdo rude bitch for just making out Today at work I look like trash my hair is greasy and I came here stoned I think my boss knew and called me into his office to talk about a position here since I am trying to become full time I m pretty sure they are aware I am mentally ill and that I have a hard time being a capable person I have to remind myself to look people in the eye and I am not impressive I don t think I appear normal at all,Suicidal Reference
Hello This is my first ever ever ever post on this thread and my first ever ever post on reddit I read the announcement about using flair I ll try my best but tbh I don t know yet what flair is so please don t kick me off if I fail to add flair to this post I also read the announcement about not use this forum to try and get a diagnosis for yourself or others which is great I am not asking for a diagnosis I have been told by two mental health professionals that I don t have BPD Maybe I actually don t and that s OK Medical labels are social constructions anyway What matters though is that I have been to more counselors than I can count been on more medications than I can count have been difficult and unstable for my whole life starting at age 2 and nothing works for more than a few months Everything I read about BPD fits my experience so so well mood swings extreme emotional sensitivity long history of friendship and relationship drama near constant desire for self harm and a few actual instances deep dark bad depressive episodes and above all the lack of stable identity There are other ways I don t quite meet the official criteria for borderline but I m OK with that I want to feel better and I want take a pragmatic approach If I am suffering in much the same ways as people who are officially BPD then the stuff that helps them heal is also the stuff that will help me heal I would like to know what sort of self help or self care strategies have helped people on this forum I want to try DBT but not sure if I d be able to get access to a DBT therapist without a diagnosis Plus I just lost my job and am kind of broke so that might not be an option anyway Do self help DBT books work What other activities can you do on your own for relatively cheap Are there any supplements or medications that have helped you Dietary changes Other things that may or may not be good to know about me age 34 white cis bi female in between jobs school career paths whatever and I don t know what I m doing next just got fired and this has triggered a really bad episode Meds currently on 150mg for Wellbutrin for depression I am working on being off it completely because it makes me really agitated Have been on nearly all the SSRIs but the side effects are the worst Also on 300mg gabapentin for nerve pain Substances I have a medical marijuana card and use that regularly for pain and anxiety and sometimes recreation I live in a hippy college town It s everywhere My experience with weed is that it s medicinal and helps me a lot physically and can sometimes be the only thing that helps me come down from an anxiety attack or feeling self harm impulses but of course with mental health stuff going on I worry about dependence addiction I drink alcohol but am good about moderating that but nonetheless have been considering quitting I have done MDMA coke mushrooms and acid a handful of times and for the most part have had no negative experiences Other conditions I have fibromyalgia and chronic recurrent Epstein Barr aka chronic pain and chronic fatigue Also super sensitive to sensory overstimulation especially noise and touch texture Have been diagnosed with depression and GAD Trauma abuse history No history of childhood trauma but I was with an emotionally abusive partner from ages 22 30 Definitely still affects me now I also lost my home and all of my stuff in a fire at age 32 and that trauma might still be with me But I ve definitely felt this way my whole life so I wouldn t say any of my BPD ish feelings are triggered by these two things but maybe they ve worsened in response I am very lucky to have a wonderful partner who I live with and loves me to death but he doesn t understand why I m feeling this way and is frustrated He wants to help but doesn t know how So also what kind of self help is good for couples dealing with possible or actual BPD Basically I m just looking for what kind of self help and lifestyle changes have worked for you because I need SOMETHING diagnosis or no Thank you,Suicidal Reference
I have recent problem with my Gf with BPD and i think i need some advices on this So here s the story Just yesterday night she texted me talking about how badly she was feeling with her depression and asked me to go to her apartment immediately So i complied and went to her and check with she s ok As i opened the door i found her weeping and was holding a knife cutting her own arm I was shocked to see her doing this because she seemed absolutely normal the day before I stayed at a distance and asked her about her feelings and she told me that she felt like i was having an affair with a female friend of mine simply because we hung out the day before It was absolutely not true cause i ll never cheat on her so I tried to reason with her but she was too unstable to listen Then strangely she told me to come closer She was still holding the knife and It was creepy as fuck So i asked her to put down the knife first She did so and i approached her calmly and sat down on the bed looking as humble as possible She asked me typical BPD questions like you wanna leave me Am i not loveable etc I answered everything truthfully and i told her that i m all hers She then held my hand picked up that knife and she started cutting my arm but she did it gently I was like WTF I was reluctant at first but then idk my masochistic tendency kicked in and somehow find it romantic and sexual lol She dominated me that night but i could see that she did not do this out of sexual fantasy she was angry and we were barely making love I was more like a punch bag for her to leash her negative emotions but part of me enjoyed it So after the sex this morning she told me of the same thing as she did yesterday of feeling depressive I did the same thing as i did yesterday I m feeling emotionally physically exhausted and she s clearly abusing me I cannot continue letting her do this even if i enjoyed the sex it was too exploitative What should i do I don t want to leave her cause i still love her dearly and she isn t a sociopath How to make her less dependent Or should i just leave I m worrying about her as well as myself,Suicidal Reference
I ve been fighting this thing for three years in order to try and reconstruct what was a beautiful relationship over the summer of 2012 I think I m just losing all hope that I ll recover from it Medications have failed me I ve actually gone into serotonin shock more than once from SSRIs I ve unfairly blamed all of that on my significant other I was a lonely person before this and always contemplated suicide My first attempt was by hanging at 13 years old before a school dance Now that I ve opened myself up to another person it just feels like I m moving into a space that s constantly vulnerable She knows things about me that I never even recognized before meeting her It feels like I m this open book that s just filled with the worst pulp fiction narratives Perhaps fighting for a dead romance like this is quixotic to the extreme We re both just so tired So tired I m contemplating staying home from work today and just downing all of my lamotrigine I don t know if it would be enough to kill me but I m considering finding out Maybe sleeping pills Just quietly drift off into the darkness and finally know some peace from this mental prison this hell on earth I don t believe in a god or gods or an afterlife I just want to stare off into the howling dark and step through the veil into peace However I m too much of a coward to finish the job I know it even as I stare off at the bottle I ve done terrible things and at some point I have to find out where the disorder begins and I end I have to try and shoulder years of neglect and torment I have to find a way to bridge the gap from where I am to her heart I have no idea where to start I feel just this infinite void where I used to feel alive to some degree Everything that used to bring me happiness has brought me some great form of pain I ve twisted and broken everything around me into something that s an emotional weapon Everything is about guarding something inside me but there s nothing left to guard No secrets remain So why do I keep fighting Why am I just so tired,Suicidal Reference

Let me preface this by saying I m not posting to brag I feel a little messed up and I m hoping people can share their perspective I got diagnosed and developed a treatment plan for BPD with my therapist and psychiatrist about 7 months ago There have been a lot of positive changes during that time a toxic relationship ended and I m learning to develop my own concrete identity I m getting more comfortable with the prospect of maintaining casual relationships I ve embraced minimalism and learned how to center myself by creating order in the areas of my life where I can Over the course of the past few weeks I ve found myself overwhelmed with joy Good problem to have right Sure except I randomly find myself welling up with tears and shaking at really inappropriate moments I can t explain these feelings to anyone because they don t understand how extreme these feelings are It s distracting too it s difficult to maintain focus on my tasks because I feel like I m about to burst We talk about emotionality and the way our minor torments feel like being flayed But nobody talks about the opposite what happens when you can t control your joy I understand rationally that these feelings are supposed to be the reward for the hard work I ve been doing But I m back to wanting to cry all the time and I can t regulate it at all I m actually thinking about cutting just so I have something to focus on I see my therapist again on Thursday What can I do in the meantime,Suicidal Reference

REPOSTING from r marijuana looking for advice and nobody there has commented yet s hey everyone I apologise in advance for the long depressing rambling post So I m a 20 year old girl smoking 1 3g a day as a means to treat my Borderline Personality Disorder and Body Dysmorphia I ve been smoking daily since I was 17 and regularly since I was 15 I ve found marijuana to be the only only therapy from different prescription substances to counselling to DBT etc effective in treating the affective instability crippling paranoia insomnia self esteem issues and urges to self harm associated with my PD It also does better than anything else to make me feel comfortable leaving my house on bad days with my body dysmorphia which causes me to see myself as a disfigured freak When I smoke I love myself I am able to let go of things faster and take significantly longer to act on the impulses which control and destroy my quality of life without it This week my boyfriend encouraged me to slow down or take a break with smoking as he s concerned it s taken over my life and that I prioritise it too highly While he s right that it is and has been for years one of my main priorities I always saw this as more of a as much of a priority as insulin is to diabetics kind of thing Symptom gt Treatment gt Relief right Anyway I ve always had a healthy relationship with my weed use and never did anything desperate to score could go without for a little while if I needed to etc but lately my bf and I are both noticing that I am needing to smoke more to maintain that same feeling of relief and we re starting to worry about the impact it s having on my health While I don t feel any different now it may not be the case a few years down the track The bottom line is that I d love to live my life without a dependency on external stimuli to keep me going I d love to wake up in the morning and just love myself and just not feel anxiety and just not do impulsive things but at the end of the day that s a pipe dream for anyone suffering from a chronic lifelong psychiatric disorder At the moment upon my bf s recommendation I ve cut down to less than a gram in the last 3 days and I feel ok But how long will this last Does anyone have any tips on how to make this break cut down easier Anyone here with BPD got tips on alternatives for slowing the racing mind down Thanks for reading if you got this far _,Suicidal Reference

After many years of therapists and friends telling me I have anger problems my newest therapist has informed me that what everyone thought was an issue of anger management is simply a symptom of BPD I didn t know what it was and I ve just found this out yesterday After doing some research and reading and seeing the patterns of thought and actions related to this it s pretty obvious that it s what I suffer from Part of me feels relieved that I m not the only one and the other half of me is devastated that this is something that will always be there lurking This news came a little late as I d recently lost another relationship with a girl I d planned to marry but she couldn t understand what I was feeling and that frustrated her And I suppose it s not her fault at the time I didn t understand it But I want to and I want to be better I ve never hurt anyone else but I lash out at myself every time I get angry it makes me feel better and worse all at once I know this is a rambling post and it s the first I ve submitted on Reddit but I was hoping some people that have been battling this could give me some advice or tips they ve learned or anything My therapist and I will be developing a plan to combat these feelings but I also have a desire to hear from people that also suffer from it Thank you all for any help you re able to provide,Suicidal Reference

Got well pissed at a friend s birthday party Regained my memory walking at a pace towards a Metro station after looking desperately for knives which I could not find Apparently I refused to leave the house where the houseparty happened after telling them to fuck off The only things I could wring from them were that I Äúmolested Äù them and that I was Äúa danger to Äù them Since these friends are prone to exaggeration I don t know what to make of it all Everything is different They don t even think so themselves after I apologized with homemade peanutbutter Äìchocolate cookies and bottles of w dka I live in the Rzeczpospolita Polski 1 They genuinely believe it is fine But I am so sensitive and so vulnerable that I see that they have subconsciously changed their behaviour around me Everything is different It was so good and so happy and so fun That is all gone I feel empty Wrong Bad Evil But also victimized to have been left to die that night I have always been there for them But the first time I ever call upon that favour it is too much for them As if it weren t too much for me to console my friends when they were suicidal 1 the badass formal name for Poland,Suicidal Reference
There is no cure for mental illness No matter what treatment I have or what meds I try from now on this is a part of me and all my control on the outside is for the benefit of other people On the inside I m always going to feel this way After letting that sink in I don t think I can go on,Suicidal Reference
Sometimes I feel gypped by my Äúfriends Äù They know how crazy I am Whenever we begin to become close I explain the disorder to them I keep them updated on it I tell them about my trials and tribulations with self harm and suicidal behaviour But when it happens to them they often give up I understand how most would feel emotionally blackmailed I understand most would feel unethical feigning competency I understand they may feel they did not realize what was coming I understand I am a lot to handle I understand that it can drag them down and weigh on them heavily My inner thoughts are Try being me When the contract was sealed and we became friends did we not agree to care for each other unconditionally Are we unable to disentangle which parts belong to us and which parts belong to our disorders and syndromes Would we not stay by the side of a person with a cold and excuse his annoying tiredness and loud sneezes and need for care when he is fatigued We would not blame him because we know those things are his cold s fault My disorder is not a license But it does not abrogate the covenant of unconditional love upon which friendship is predicated I put up with things others do and say that to me in my reality are crushing and inexcusably hurtful I do it with calm and composure It is no wonder I often snap given the tempest that is my mind So I feel I must lie and manipulate and deceive to get people to care about me Thus they are really only pretending to care This means I have to bottle it all up And the dialectical dilemmas seem to me to be results of uncontrollable emotions in a world deficient in empathy Sometimes I feel others could take away the pain if only they would listen Why can noone put up with me,Suicidal Reference
About a year ago my doctor started me on fluoxetine for depression In a later visit she told me that she thinks I have BPD but she s not going to diagnose me I didn t ask why If anyone knows of any possibilities why she wouldn t diagnose me that would be a great help Right so I asked to try amitriptyline instead of fluoxetine as I read fluoxetine doesn t help depression in cases of BPD She told me that she didn t want to due to the possibility of fatal overdose and she didn t think I was ready I had been suicidal before this point however haven t felt that way for at least 2 months About a month or two ago I stopped taking my fluoxetine to see if I felt any difference and other than mad withdrawal I felt exactly the same on them as I do off them I don t want to keep going back and asking for amitriptyline but I want to know if they ll help Any suggestions on how I would bring it up I haven t been back since my last prescription of fluoxetine which was about two months three months ago and didn t talk to her about coming off them,Suicidal Reference
My partner recently has gotten into this horrible cycle of one night absolutely hating me crying relapsing into self harm and the other being in idealized love It especially picked up after I gave her oral I suppose we moved along too quickly intimately I think I get it amp it s fine but it s also harming to me amp I want to figure out if there s an optimal way to deal with this scenario to bring her out of this cycle Just recently after years of believing they had BPD they now deny it calling themselves weak or pathetic denying that I love them because they cannot be lovable etc Sometimes I wonder in the heat of the moment as she s pained so much if we should take a break or if she d be better off single for her own good I don t know it s a side thought I suppose things will pass Looking for any tips amp folks who ve gone through similar circumstances Thanks,Suicidal Reference
I m a rape sexual assault survivor and tonight my boyfriend told me that I would enjoy being sexually assaulted as long as the guy in question were attractive It feels like a slap in the face especially because he yelled it at me I then questioned him about whether he would say the same about my rape and he scoffed in my face and refused to apologize when I started crying and reiterating his comments to him Eventually he hung up on me This is it This is the worst most painful thing anyone I loved has ever said to me And he doesn t even care I never reported my rapist and I regret that decision every day I don t want to let my bf get away with similar comments My rapist literally told me that I probably enjoyed it note I was asleep in my bed when it happened and for months I blamed myself I thought I was too sexual That I needed too much attention I convinced myself that I deserved it It s taken me this long to even slightly recover from this mind set and now it makes me sick to think how many guys think like this and how many never get put in their place I have the conversation recorded I want to send it to his parents At least to have some peace of mind on the matter His comments were absolutely disgusting and sad He was so arrogant There is a chance that he will see this and laugh again because of the type of guy he is I feel so suicidal This is the most triggering topic for me It s the most traumatizing and now I m sitting alone in a dark room having to face these thoughts Having to relive that night and I can t do it I want to rip my skin off I can t escape the feelings It happened almost two years ago to this day and I still have nightmares about that night I m shaking on the bathroom floor I feel so sick The room is spinning this is the only thing I can focus my attention on right now I have no one to talk to How can someone be so fucking careless,Suicidal Reference

5 months ago I posted this https www reddit com r BPD comments 35r522 doing_pretty_well_but_only_due_to_very_limited where I talked about being worried that the only reason I was okay was because I had no obligations Well turns out I was right In the last few weeks I ve gone from zero obligations besides group therapy once a week to getting signed up to 2 x 2 hr classes at an adult learning centre as well as liaising with my caseworker there The first week was terrible emotionally as I felt panicked penned in and under pressure I only went to one of the classes and ditched the other one I had initially spoken with my caseworker about how I was so ready to move on and was looking forward to doing something different and how she should definitely start seeing about getting me an internship somewhere as I was very eager to start the road back to employment Well Turns out that for all my desire to move forward my BPD had other ideas The panic and stress over attending classes for 4 measly hours a week hit hard and I bunked off everything last week including my group therapy I just didn t want to deal with any of it I m having a really hard time coming to terms with the fact that I couldn t even handle such a small load It nearly killed me to realise I couldn t finish my MA a couple of years ago seriously considered suicide it took A LOT to accept that I d have to make do with a BA but that was still something I could work with But to now face the fact that I can t even handle 4 hrs a week of stuff that isn t even that demanding has turned out to be extremely difficult Going from high functioning to barely functioning has been a massive blow and I m not sure how to address it I talked about it in Group this week but was still so caught up in the emotional upheaval of it all that I was very short with people and wasn t actually in a place to process their advice or sympathy So with that massive ramble behind me does anyone have any advice commiseration stories they d like to share Or do I just need to get over myself and realise that I m not the superhuman I assumed I was I ll do my best to not be as dismissive this time P,Suicidal Reference
I mishandled a situation with my husband a few days ago I let my emotions take over and it really hurt him I still don t quite understand it because it didn t seem that bad to me Anyway we made up sort of got back to a place of hugs and minor affection but he has shown no interest in me otherwise He s been buried in a video game and sleeping when I m awake and awake when I m asleep for two days now During the fight I dissociated pretty badly but can t back for us to talk out out While talking it out I told him I was in a good place to listen because it s what he needed He talked of all the things about my behavior that are hard to deal with for him This caused me to disassociate again And I keep waiting to come back to feel better After two days I woke up feeling the same way and I just started bawling Why am I this way I m so tired I NEED this to stop and I can t control it Why am I so weak I m losing my husband to this disease and all I can do is watch it happen so detached that out just looks like I m numb when on the inside I m planning my own death How do I get out of this mess Please help,Suicidal Reference
I m fairly certain the abuse and neglect I received as a young child from age 6 12 mainly resulted in my BPD and OCD I was typically a child who acted out Disrupting others in school frequently bullying others I was bullied as well Then from age 12 14 I had extreme mood swings periods where I had intense anger often resulting in me threatening to kill myself or breaking things Often triggered by the smallest things Around age 17 these periods became less frequent but my depression and anxiety got much worse I think because I began internalizing I basically went from being a classic case of BPD to a quiet case Since turning 19 or so 25 now I m practically a doormat Smiling and agreeing to everything Sometimes I ll have an emotional outburst but nowhere near anything like what I used to do A lot of the time these outburst come in the form of sadness more so than anger although sometimes still anger or frustration Maybe it s because I m further away in time from my period of trauma I m not sure I also basically had to teach myself right from wrong and how to show compassion and that those things were right and treating others badly was wrong I basically put on a mask and a muzzle that I ve been wearing for the past years I ve silenced myself so much that I don t even know how to feel or act Anyone else experience this,Suicidal Reference

In the last couple of months I ve become very close with another borderliner and I m not sure whether our friendship is healthy or not Recently I was hospitalised for depression suicidal tendancies While I was at home on a weekend visit I got a facebook message from an old acquaintance asking if I wanted to meet later at a bar We hadn t spoken in about 2 years and I thought it was strange but I went When I got there he told me that he had recently broken up with his girlfriend and had written to lots of people out of desperation because he didn t want to be alone At first I didn t want to mention that I was currently staying in the psychiatric ward but at some point I just felt like confiding in him and was pleasantly surprised to find out that he had similar life experience to mine We continued to write while I was in hospital and on my next weekend home we met up again We went walking and talking for 12 hours and then I went back to his house to sleep over We ended up having sex but agreed not to tell anyone It felt like we just got to know each other really quickly and I think we understand each other really well The next week I was released from the clinic and since then we are pretty much inseparable We write first thing every morning and last thing at night We continued to sleep together for a bit but neither of us wanted to turn it into a relationship and we agreed that our friendship was the most important thing He got to know a new girl and now they re together but the intimacy of our friendship hasn t really diminished at all except that we no longer have sex He s the first one I write to when I feel bad and he helps me through the hard times And he tells me about his dark thoughts and I m there for him too My other friends were initially skeptical but I think they see now that he really does care about me I guess I m just not sure how to tell whether this is a real friendship or just the result of two unstable people colliding,Suicidal Reference

I submitted a very similar post to the suicide watch subreddit and admit that i received less comments than expected Perhaps this is because the subreddit concerns a great variety of obstacles that people face in their lives Perhaps it is better to submit this post here as I have BPD and people here are more familiar with the phenomena of splitting and idealization anyway what s happening is this There is someone I love who I met a year ago When I met her I was 17 and she is in her 20 s I started feeling this way for her early on but waited until I was 18 to say anything of this There are more things that occurred in this time but I will not overcomplicate things I often have the compulsion to give into suicide For a long time I was able to motivate myself away from this by imagining dating her living with her and helping her to achieve her goals as she is also mentally ill and faces similar obstacles Well I recently admit these feelings to her and she says to me that she does not feel this way about me and never will Well now I feel great pain I am a very eccentric person and so is she to some extent the people I feel I am compatible with and can be totally honest with are extremely few The narrative in my mind is that there is no one similar to me in this world and that I will spend my time here blocked off from others with no opportunity for strong friendships and romantic relationships I admit I used this idealized future as a crutch and in the knocking out of it from under me I now feel the despair I avoided now coming at me in full force and that I really have no reason to live This is what I am facing right now and I hope I have explained it coherently perhaps better than I did in the other subreddit Advice is greatly appreciated,Suicidal Reference
And by sometimes I mean all the time I do get how ridiculous I m being There s no way I m faking this cutting relapse How does one fake panic attacks when trying to fill out job applications Or fake being unable to breathe when they try to talk to their professors Why would I willingly choose to feel paralyzed at the thought of writing this admittedly not difficult essay or other homework assignments to the point that I m almost a month behind in two classes Who the fuck would actually want to be so down that they can t even crawl out of bed some mornings etc etc And then my brain tells me these are all fake or over exaggerated to the point that they might as well be fake You just want fresh cuts so if someone finds out they ll give you a lot more attention than if they only found scars you just don t want to work you re lazy nothing else is the matter with you you just want your professors to give you special attention you re choosing to not get out of bed are common thoughts It s SO hard to fight them and not believe them when they ve become an every minute of every day thought process Even with the smallest problem nope you re faking shut the hell up I hate these thoughts but it feels impossible to not be controlled by them,Suicidal Reference
hey the question is what do you do when you get stuck in some kind of mixed state I ask because I feel like I am stuck in multiple emotions at once I am depressed while upset while being okay while jealous and disappointed and mad at myself as well as feeling lonely and unfulfilled in life it is really messing up my brain and making my stomach hurt what can I do I would like to feel one way instead of like smiling while crying and punching a wall at the same time as I cut myself and overdose I guess the best way to relate it is when it rains while the sun is shining also I am trying to get the courage to tell my father that I want to teach overseas I lack the power to accept him being upset that is how he has control over me any tips,Suicidal Reference
He was my best friend for years and although I d never tell him this for fear of scaring him the only reason that I didn t kill myself as a teenager as he was thevonly thing I had that made me not feel awful while I was going though the hardest times and was so alone He had a lot of mental health issues like me but after he started getting better he drifted away He d still talk to me sometimes but not the way we used to Once we planned to meet up and see a movie but I got very drunk AND had a manic episode bipolar leading to be being contained by the police and sectioned in hospital Afterwards he told me I needed to get help I did and I m in no way perfect and still working on it but I did get a bit better I ve been to hospital a few times since then and seem to get better every time But he doesn t talk to me or respond to my attempts EVER It didn t even happen immediately after the police ambulance thing It was completely out of the blue He doesn t respond on Facebook but still uses it so it s not like he s quit it or anything and I ve tried calling him not too much and it rings for a bit and then hangs up So it s obviously on purpose I ve gotten to the point that I realise it s yet another person who has decided they hate me I only have one person in my life who kinda likes me and even that is though the obligation that we ve been dating for 6 and a half years but that s another story But I m really struggling with the fact that I have no idea why I ALWAYS NEED TO KNOW WHY EVEN IF IT S REALLY STUPID I JUST NEED TO KNOW,Suicidal Reference

I m probably going to commit suicide within the next 2 years or so That s if I still can t afford to get any kind of treatment I have no health insurance and no emotional support from anyone especially NOT family You want to know what s hilarious I ve told my family that I m depressed I ve told them that I ve thought about suicide and how I have bpd depression adhd I told them I m in a lot of pain Guess what they said Go to church Just pray We all have our dysfunctions so what I also know how they d react if they found me dead They would just think I m an idiot That s how my family has always seen me in the first place If anything goes wrong the finger gets pointed to me first Blame blame blame to the point where I got used to blaming myself for everything I m too ugly too fat too stupid to be alive and contribute to anything I ve even talked about these things with my friends but friends can only do so much besides listen They just get to the point of being too uncomfortable to talk about things like this Why burden them I ve made a list of things to do before I die The method will be nitrogen gas asphyxiation Surprisingly it s very easy to obtain a big tank of pure ol 100 nitrogen gas I don t feel like anyone takes me seriously when I say that I m very sick and I need help It s actually incredibly sad to know that I can t get help only because I can t afford it right now Why bother to live in a world when you receive absolutely no emotional moral support from anyone No thanks Just wanted to post this somewhere because I can t keep all of this stuff to myself but don t want to tell anyone I know edit Thanks for all of your responses everyone Although I have begun planning a way out I am going to do my best to at least sign up for medicaid this year and seek some kind of treatment from a doctor therapist It s the only thing I can really think of at this point If no treatment is helping I will probably still continue to plan my end Honestly I am not sad about dying but rather calm and relieved at the thoughts about it Anyway I have read every response here and will try to hold onto hope for as long as I can The replies did help even just a little Thank you again,Suicidal Reference

I don t have anyone to talk or vent to right now I would welcome support or ideas to cope in a positive way Right now I am maxed out and do not have the capacity to handle criticism of me or my dad so I would appreciate it if you would withold any negative remarks or criticism The issue is my father I m crashing on a couch in his studio I m too broke to have a place on my own I m sorta at my limit now A relative asked me to cat sit for the weekend place to myself yeah Returning home has been that much harder I thought about jumping on the subway tracks on the way home because I m dealing with being a failure being broke trying to get into some kind of helpful treatment my father is getting on my last nerve It s Sunday the cafe I charged a tea on my credit card ugh so I could sit in peace and quiet closed early Finding quiet places is rare here it s crowded and busy I took the subway home and made dinner low blood sugar and sat down on reddit to try to decompress from wading through crowds to the subway station and the hour ride on the subway My dad was watching TV when i arrived and I basically avoided eye contact so he wouldn t try to talk to me He usually watches TV when he s home and doesn t talk to me much which is preferable When I got home I could tell he wanted to talk after being alone over the weekend Both he and my mother would rely on me as a kid and adult for social contact While I am an intovert and have social anxiety myself I am somewhat understanding but even I am better about not expecting others to fill the void and will leave people alone It has made me resentful that they have both expected me to fill that void while simultaneously ignoring my needs as unimportant He still decided to ignore my non verbals and tried to talk to me I told him I needed to be alone He said Why You ve been alone all weekend And I repeated I just need to be alone Him why Me firmly I need to be alone him why Me LEAVE ME ALONE him why I ignore him He mutters something I can t hear I m wearing earplugs because he blasts the TV He refuses to wear headphones because they re uncomfortable or get a hearing aid so he can hear at normal voice levels I m often forced to yell and repeat myself so I don t enjoy our conversations and he complains that he can t hear me unless I m facing him and I need to stop swallowing my words when I talk to him His neighbors haven t complained that I heard and I only hear one of them so I m crossing my fingers this is a non issue with them because I don t want to be involved So after a few minutes he addresses me and talks even though I m not looking at him He says that two people are living here and he is not comfortable with the silent treatment While logically in my head I can understand his side to some degree I m pissed that he is not respecting my need for space If he could just give me some time to decompress and leave me alone for a while I might be calm enough to talk to him However I am in such a heightened emotional state I cannot speak also I know from experience that whatever request or explanation I make will be rejected He will tell me I don t understand blah blah blah It will be some comment about how I m being unreasonable and how I should act instead I know that talking will just make me more upset so I grab my coat and leave with him yelling after me I am actually shaking right now It s very upsetting to know that anything I say no matter how reasonable or logically I state it I have tried in the past and the attempts only lead him to bait me to the point where I m emotional and he can dismiss me I ve been told by many people already that they admire that even when upset I can express myself articulately and reasonably With my father however that goes out the window I was incapable of requesting time alone with a clear reason because I am already burnt out by my last attempts I know that I need to get out and he s been wearing me down convincing me it s a bad idea to leave I didn t tell him about cat sitting at my relatives I just left him a note because I knew I was too open to him talking me out of it I ve been invited to cat sit again next weekend I will leave him a note again I know if I mention it to him I ll end up cancelling But in the meantime I m not sure who I can turn to to get out He s not physically harming me he s not verbally abusive but this situation is really affecting me in a bad way I don t understand how it works exactly that he has so much power I m carrying a lot of rage I m borderline suicidal and I m sinking into hopelessness and depression On the one hand I feel almost that I need someone to intervene and rescue me but that worries me because it s codependent behavior and I need to get myself out of this somehow so I can break free,Suicidal Reference

My dogs are the reason I m still here When my mom died when I got diagnosed when all my friends left me my dogs stayed by my side and loved me all the same My eldest dog got sick this week and deteriorated really quickly Me and my partner couldn t afford a costly operation but we did everything else we could her last day was spent cuddling with me I knew then that I d probably have to have her put to sleep We took her back to the vet and the result was euthanasia At the time I was so sure I did the right thing for her But now I feel like I killed my pup without giving her a chance to prove us wrong She was so happy even at the end and it doesn t feel right that she had to die I ve got a voice in my head constantly berating me for killing my pup I m going through every single word that was said by myself my partner and the vet in painful detail winding myself up all the time I feel like I killed her for no reason and no amount of logic will change that I don t care about anything else right now I feel like I should be dead too,Suicidal Reference
I ll leave out the useless details I don t know how to deal with my fear and mistrust I ve gone through her email Skype Facebook phone ect I found a few things that set me off I ve never had the anger problems so much as going from extremely loving and caring to cold and indifferent in the blink of an eye I believe she s never cheated on me but I ve caught her in a few lies mainly because I ve snooped When I m with her everything is fine until I m away and I start getting paranoid I love her and I trust her but I can t stop myself from trying to go through her stuff I think deep down I fear that although I haven t found anything to worry about this time the next time I might And if I don t look then I m going to miss something that could destroy the relationship In person you d never know I had BPD and she doesn t have any idea the extent that I ve gone through her stuff I recognize that in snooping for a problem to fix I ve become the primary risk to the stability of my relationship and yet I m not sure what to do I ve tried to stop and I ve got her to change all her passwords Now I find myself looking at her Skype profile to see if she s online talking to name he was flirting openly and it took quite a while for her to reject his advances I can t see who she s talking to but I believe it s him I called her on Skype when I seen her online just so I could hear the notification sound of the messages she s getting At the same time now that I can t look I m even more paranoid And to top things off she s codependent to the point of threatening suicide if I ever left her Advice Sorry I just need to talk to someone,Suicidal Reference

Hey everyone I ve been dealing with BPD all my life and was just recently few months ago officially diagnosed The doctor has since taken this diagnosis back as she felt I was too young to be diagnosed with this I m 20 But that s a whole nother story Anyway I ve had some issues with my relationship of about 2 years I love him more than anything I really do There s no denying that however lately it has seemed that the diagnosis has made a huge shift in our relationship I constantly am in fear of him leaving and he is used to this as it s been happening since the beginning I also have PTSD and often have anxiety attacks flashbacks nightmares etc Lately it s seemed that he s been treating me more as my diseases rather than a person I hope that makes sense Last time I tried to go to him with an urge to self harm he simply said You re doing this to yourself along with a few other things I know he means well but it s really hurting me to hear that when I m so low already My question is how do I get him to treat me more like me Like a person instead of a disease or mental patient Any advice relating to my doctor issues would be appreciated as well Do I just switch docs Clinics What do I do Thank you for reading,Suicidal Reference

I don t want to bother listing all the criteria I fit here because I know no one can diagnose me but a psychiatrist seeing one on March 6th but I m now 18 and have been researching BPD off and on since I was 16 After dating a girl with BPD who in fact thought I might have it as well I m almost positive I do but I m incapable of bringing it up with my therapists My last therapist was manipulative as shit and also super homophobic I don t ID as a girl even though I was assigned female at birth I m agender but I was too scared to tell her since she thought the fact I was dating a girl at all was due to my sexual abuse by a peer and that I d be straight when I was older Aside from the fact that my abuse gets invalidated all the time because I was around 12 13 and my abuser was only a year older at the time and we were in a relationship I know I developed a traumatic bond though I m continuously treated as if I have depression anxiety Bipolar was suggested when I mentioned that I ve had what I believed to be a mixed episode but I was also in college and under a lot of stress I took a frantic walk at 4 a m and came very near throwing myself off a bridge I m officially diagnosed with ADHD which I agree with major depressive disorder which I do not and generalized anxiety disorder which is probably a yeah I got the MDD and GAD diagnoses when I spent 72 voluntary hours in a mental health center because I was worried I was going to kill myself IMHO my mood is just too labile for an MDD diagnosis I swing abruptly out of happy and sad by the minute almost I m constantly irritable and manipulative even though I know I m doing it I change identities and life goals on a weekly sometimes daily basis I ve been struggling with self harm for a few years now progressed from skin scratching to cutting I go from excitable and full of new ideas to depressive empty and wanting to die within minutes I went from idealizing my gf and our relationship to breaking up with her after Christmas and hating her from a distance even though everything was civil and I have no idea how to control any of this anymore I m in limbo If I don t get a formal diagnosis I feel like I m going to fucking die No one takes my input on anything anymore because I m fucking crazy My dad s girlfriend sent me out of the house to live with my mom and stepdad because I cut No one acknowledges my struggle except for my mom and my cousin and my best friend Am I BPD Am I a shit person Should I try and seek an official diagnosis I just don t know what the fuck is wrong with me and it s making me hate myself,Suicidal Reference
I do know that people don t want to take medication while you are depressed or all this shit in the mind and body I wonder why people choose not to medicate Is it for the side effects That it s screwing with your body mind To you think it s some kind of poison or it s just chemicals placebo and so on I have chosen to medicate myself There are a lot of side effects no doubt that I tried a lot of different medicine My daily medicine base is 8 pills Anti depression mood stabiliser anti anxiety one other for anxiety if I need it works faster and one for the sleep I m diagnosed with BPD and my psychiatrist is talking about bipolar2 therefore the mood stabilisers even out the mood duh and it s most common to give it to ppl with bipolar I chose to medicate mostly to make me stop to harm myself And anti depressions I ve nomnom for many years It have helped me through everything a LOT I m medicate whit a lot of shit but the change is worth the side effects some days not I m still going around home written sick no work or anything it s very boring most of the time I reasonably began a help group for ppl like me just to get us out of the home and socialise and drink a lot of coffe I m waiting to begin DBT no date set but probably soon And hoping to stop taking everything might end up with taking anti depression for the rest of my life but that is soooooo okey with me Better that then have to fight myself for the rest of my life I hope you all have YOUR way to deal with all of this mental handicap Stay strong And I would really like tho read all of your thoughts about medication an other ways that makes you feel better Have a wonderful night Lives in Sweeden So nighty night,Suicidal Reference
background 22F seen three psychiatrists since I was 13 all of them treated me for depression it never really worked My dad is a psychiatrist and as a teenager I d overhear him refer to me as a borderline when talking to my mom I looked it up and I have no doubt in my mind that I am a borderline I tend to make good first impressions and am very good some might say manipulative at making myself seem like a victim I also mislead doctors about many things Growing up I always heard my dad talk about how mental health professionals including himself don t like to treat certain patients including borderlines people with eating disorders and people who self harm In classic borderline fashion I always get people to try to like me and subconsciously I think I tried to paint myself as a person who is depressed I didn t tell them I have an eating disorder or that I used to self harm because I wanted my doctors to like me and hearing my dad talk about how horrible it is to treat certain patients made me want to be a good patient that my doctors enjoy seeing I could see how a doctor who only talked to me for an hour might not realize I m a borderline So my question is should I just tell my next doctor all of this I m worried if I don t I ll slip back into wanting to be a perfect patient On the other hand it seems rude to tell a doctor that I ve diagnosed myself I don t want to sound like an idiot hypochondriac or a Wed MD doctor and I don t want to insult the doctor by acting like I can do their job better than they can so what should I do,Suicidal Reference
So as you can guess I have BPD I ve been enrolled in a once a week DBT programme for about a year now I feel to some extent it s helped my self harm I only attempted suicide once in that year so I guess it was effective But recently I feel everything has got a lot worse I use my skills but they don t help I constantly switch between agitated and highly depressed I become so depressed I have no motivation to get out of bed I sleep roughly 2 3 hours a night I have nightmares and in the last month I ve tried slit my wrist and drown myself My reasoning for this is I feel everyone around me would be much better off without me I still go to my job but I m late everyday and I feel I m close to being fired I m not sure what I should do I feel one false move and I will probably kill myself I ve also been seeing flashes of white light so I feel my physical health is going What should I do if I feel my DBT is not affective I can t go on like this,Suicidal Reference

Sorry fot the wall of text my first post here It s truly starting to feel like almost EVERYTHING I think or perceive has to be questioned leading into ultimate confusion despair and paralysis I admit I m a chronic overthinker probably am OCD and have anxiety worry issues but I can think back to times where they didn t seem to completely OWN me It doesn t help that I trusted my thoughts and perceptions for the most part before I realized I had BPD I was able to spot things like passive aggression for instance from a mile away I don t think that s only because I m hypersensitive though I m in a relationship that s been quite stormy where even before what I think is my BPD was known to myself I discussed with my partner BOTH of our passive aggressive behaviors and that I really hate them Which is a contradiction I m sure She s admitted to some that were to potentially trigger me or to gauge my reaction her own saying and now it s hard not to fixate on that This made me seek out more insight because my feelings and what I perceived her to be and me not being able to trust when she was wasn t being honest about being passive was ONE of the factors which led me to realizing I may have BPD So naturally any further passive acts statements are filtered through my mind first identifying it as passive and hurtful asking myself if it s real or if I m over reacting because of BPD or if I m devaluing her for PAST acts of passive aggression but not being able to let the current act slide because I ve recently tried to explain to her what BPD was and expect her to stop She is highly intelligent and has a very good grasp on psychology This is what sparked the process of my mind imploding upon itself I can t really discern what s good wholehearted from what s ingenuine intentionally hurtful anymore I d really love to just be able to shut this off and ignore it but I m unable to Literally unable I have literally no friends just friends that I ve cut off after devaluing them for GOOD and maybe not so good reasons that have moved on from me would feel terribly guilty and stupid for re initiating contact feeling like the purpose would be to sustain my own sanity I m jobless live with my supportive and loving but mostly in the dark mother who it pains me to burden any longer than I have already And I know in my mind that my relationship isn t healthy so does my gf I ve tried cutting her off completely due to abandonment fears feeling devalued by things she said did herself and ended up going back every time as she accepted me back as well I know that it s partially because I have nothing else though She s been through a LOT of negative life altering shit as have I which is what initially drew me to her I didn t feel judged she s had someone she was intimate with commit suicide by overdose right next to her before shooting up one night she s a recovering heroin addict lied to me about numerous things big to absolutely trivial and is very smart but plays dumb a lot It drives me absolutely nuts every time and she is well aware of it I m basically falling apart in front of her and she s well aware of that as well Every time I tried no contact she d text me about how she missed me which always felt like a hoover but I fall for it every time I realize I could ve changed my number blocked her etc etc But it s ESPECIALLY hard to with nothing no outlet no life no friends no nothing I know my problems are way more than just me amp her but she has complete control over my emotional state more often than not and I hate it It s almost as if she s toying with me to see if she can drive me to suicide Some of these thoughts I realize may be my own and that s the one thing I HAVEN T mentioned to her Yet she keeps bringing up the other guy who committed suicide at moments where I m literally breaking down mentally in front of her I ask myself often if I m just making that link because of BPD or if it s a legitimate possibility It drives me MAD I try to progress through my days realizing that my state depression is more than just my relationship at least reading online trying to get some kind of self help and understand that some or most of it is ME but I ve made her aware of certain triggers of mine And it s as if she ll consistently trigger me as well If one doesn t work or I ignore it as best as I can it s like she shoots around until she finds another I lose my cool immediately devalue and say things like stop doing that you re really trying and start telling her that I don t appreciate her doing it It s a cycle that takes place multiple times per week Yet she s almost REFUSING to leave herself I ask her all the time why she d continuously try and rile me knowing what state I m in and she ll make some ambiguous statement like I love you I wouldn t do that I mean I have before but I wouldn t Or why do you feel that way which leads to me basically dumpingmy thoughts which are in turn SEEMINGLY used against me Every Single Time I can t snap out of it and break the cycle I ve been saying fuck it and just trying to be more open communicative about the effects of her behavior on me and show her that I m aware that I m being overly sensitive sometimes and it s like she ll be sweet for a few seconds or for a while then somewhere down the line there ll be a trigger I ll even avoid her altogether trying to gather my thoughts and be better with how I deal with them before talking to her but she ll pull me out of it somehow acting nice then passive and I fall for it all over again I know that most of this probably sounds completely exaggerated or like pure devaluation on my part but I am well aware of her good traits as well It s hard to maintain sight of them when I AM focused on the negatives but reminding myself of her good qualities not only re grounds me but KEEPS ME CONFUSED AS HELL I hate what is happening inside of my head right now I don t want to feel like I have to question EVERYTHING and whether I m projecting certain feelings or traits onto her especially when I know at least SOME of it by her admission isn t too far fetched I really truly feel like a guinea pig Not everything in my life was right before BPD as I ve never been formally diagnosed but I definitely meet all of if not most of the criteria but it s almost like she knows what she s doing to me I barely have the will to even fight it It s pathetic but seems unstoppable Does the questioning yourself and your own perceptions end Is it common I don t even know why I m asking to be honest,Suicidal Reference
here are some things that now make sense 1 When ever I was the happiest I was also the saddest I now know this is my overwhelming emotions and also I was sad because eventually that happiness would end 2 Seeing an old man driving and all my friends laughing telling him to move out of the way and calling him names It would make me feel so bad for him my eyes would water up even though I don t know him I seem to be able to put myself in other people s shoes VERY easily To the point where I can do it to people I despise I am very very empathetic 3 Everyone always calling me funny weird and cute people don t get me us so to them we are quirky and weird We just look at things differently I am actually learning to enjoy this 4 Falling in love so fast and setting low standards for my self I we just need and want love I lack confidence therefore would settle for less in hopes of not getting hurt Unfortunately this put me in damaging situations that I am still trying to cope with There are so many more but I would love to hear yours too When I was first diagnosed I was depressed and usually I still am I know when I feel JOY and HAPPINESS as rare as it is I feel it so much more than others The pain and agony i have felt make those good times so mucn better There is a good side to this I can appreciate the beauty in things others don t see I can help someone feel better that others ignore I can offer a different out look and show people a different way to look at things Sometimes it is so hard and I don t think I can take life anymore but I try to remind my self of who I am as a person not who I am when I am being triggered I was born this way and this is who I am Therapy and medicine can help but there will always be a part of me that sees and feels things differently I am learning to embrace it Edit Sorry if there are typos i am on my phone and a 15 min Break from work and I felt inspired to write this,Suicidal Reference

About myself F 21 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety years ago and more recently with BPD I am on medication and in and out of therapy however I have been self harming as a coping mechanism for years cutting scratching punching walls The issue My boyfriend finds it incredibly difficult to deal with this especially since I eg scratch during after arguments caused by me being unreasonable and it reminds him of traumatic events I really don t know what to say to him to make it easier for him and would appreciate if anyone here had any advice Thanks,Suicidal Reference
Yesterday would of been my anniversary with my ex Christmas has really set me back and yesterday has done it more I m 159 clean but have really strong urges to cut I don t want to break my streak but I miss the sensation so bad I m going to get through this I know I d just appreciate some kind words support off people who care,Suicidal Reference
I have a cycle that I m very aware of I have a PTSD nightmare that recurs just before I have a massive freakout and its been pretty consistent for years and I just recently got my BPD diagnosis to explain it I m not in therapy because when I tried that I was almost committed instead of receiving help which I posted about in another thread At any rate last night I had what I call a brain glitch where I completely went inside my own head lost control and nearly ended a 2 year relationship for some arbitrary reason based in my pain that comes from simply existing and living with this thing Fortunately my partner is willing to look at it as a one off a backslide and see a new day today but how do I let go knowing what kind of person I am How do I live in a successful relationship coping with a personality disorder that causes me to sabotage close relationships and really negatively impacts my life What point is there to living if I have to live this way,Suicidal Reference
Let me start by saying I am pretty sure I ve ruined the best relationship I ve had in years before it even had a chance to get off the ground I ve been exhibiting symptoms for at least 8 years now I didn t think much of it until this latest episode I m unsure wether to explain to the person or not what I believe with a good certainty I m going through How do I get back to what used to be normal and what others consider normal I m scared of myself and my thoughts although rarely based in self harm suicide have drifted there semi frequently How am I supposed to explain to this person what s going through my head without making things worse If anyone wants the full story on what happened you can pm me I have severe trouble developing relationships and I feel like it s just me standing in the way of myself I regularly have apathetic episodes aswell where I feel completely empty I don t really know what else to put I needed to get some of these thoughts out before they eat me up,Suicidal Reference
So after 2 years she tells me her therapy is not working and I have to find something else Everyone know that dbt is the only thing that can help and I have asked for her to help me that way And yesterday she tells me yah you need dbt and I only do talk therapy so it not working She say I ve only gotten worse since seeing her I m like yes I have tried to kill my self 3 time in the last year so yah I got worse I asked so much for dbt and hoped to get the right help But whatever I m sad that it s over and I can t be helped but I m happy I don t have to see her again Has anyone else had a therapist tell them they can t help them and what did you do did you get better help or did you give up,Suicidal Reference
I could definitely say that 2014 has qualified as the worst year of my life so far I had a suicide attempt in January broke up with my SO whom I had been with for a long time in february cut ties with my best friend and almost got thrown in jail for saying some really dumb shit to her boyfriend in June and as of last month realised that my current support group of friends that I have may very well go off and travel the world with their band leaving me behind While i try to see the good in 2014 it gets hard with all of that going on However I do know that now 2015 is a fresh start a new chance to be happy Who knows what this year will hold but I ll be doing my damnedest to make sure it s MUCH better than last year,Suicidal Reference
It makes me wonder how I m going to survive when people get sick of my shit and stop helping me Today my brother moved my clothes from the dryer because he needed to use it He put the clothes on the table next to it but they got buried under a massive mountain of towels So when I tried to get my clothes I couldn t find them all and I searched for so long and still didn t find shit because I didn t have my glasses I d lost them and got so frustrated and overwhelmed that I began to cry and got paranoid thinking that he had hidden my clothes on purpose I almost ran out of my meds this week even though I know how important they are Effexor withdrawal is terrible because I was scared and overwhelmed about phoning my doctor to make an appointment because the lady at the desk is really mean and I was scared that he d be disappointed in me for self harming I ve been without my glasses for a week and a half because I lost them and every time I tried to find them I d come up with nothing because I couldn t fucking see My dad wound up searching for them and finding them in my mess of a bedroom hidden underneath something My boss gave me a month off because they were having frapp happy hour Starbucks and she thought I couldn t handle it Someone called at some point in order to let me know I had shifts coming up and I never answer the phone because it scares me so I never got it and I thought that I d lost my job and my boss just didn t care enough to tell me If my cousin hadn t gone with me to see her I probably would have avoided it forever because in my opinion I m not worthy of my job anyway I see people all around me who are on their own who do laundry and dishes who go to work and to the gym and cook food for themselves but the tiniest everyday things are too much for me and I feel like a failure I m 21 I m supposed to be an adult Yet people are always improvising and picking up the slack in my life and I feel like shit because they shouldn t have to,Suicidal Reference

I can t take this anymore I am 22 years old and I only realized I have BPD when I found the love of my life and lost him because of it I was put on anti depressants all throughout high school and it fucking ruined my chances of getting help because they stopped me from feeling my deep down emptiness because they just made me manic I didn t realize until last year that I have hardly ever ever ever had anything that felt like ME I have never really had hobbies that I did on my own I always waited for the other kids to be done so they could play with me and kill the emptiness or I would watch TV all day I know I have so much potential inside of me and it kills me that I have caught so many glimpses of it but it always gets ripped away the love of my life brought out so much good in me he awakened my mind and my humor and my drive to live and it is better than anything I have ever experienced it actually felt like living now I am tossed back into this and I just don t know if I can do it it s like the light is gone from my life I have no desire to seek out an education or a career for myself I don t want to do anything I just want to die I am in therapy but it takes too long and I wish I had realized all this stuff before I became a 22 year old with no accomplishments besides sporadic college enrollment I want to end it all because I have no hope I am so pissed and feel so alone because everything online makes BPD out to be a life sentence where is the hope I am sick of hearing about how to control my outbursts I know how to do that I want to know what to do about the EMPTINESS,Suicidal Reference

It doesn t really need comments I just want to express things to people I know will understand I feel like I m never going to be happy again I feel like every day small things just upset me more and more and I already don t have a good domestic situation All my friends leave me or just don t talk to me I have one friend but I can t bother them all the time I just feel really alone Whenever my friend says someone is the best or comments on something they post online and has a discussion with them without trying to text me when we used to talk all the time it makes me feel awful They say they re busy with work and personal stuff and then won t try to talk to me first ever but I feel like when they re online for some time wouldn t that be enough time to send a quick text to me knowing how I am I just feel really upset Like I bother everyone I know I don t have a family to be here for me I don t really have friends I ve been trying to fight the overwhelming sadness for so long but I feel so alone and I feel like the only way to make it stop is to die I cry almost nonstop every day and I can t do it anymore I feel like it s a never ending circle and I m never going to feel okay,Suicidal Reference
Known each other for a couple of years dating for the past few weeks I m trying to stay balanced and having a hard time haven t tried a relationship in six years I d forgotten how stupid being in love makes you While discussing relationships he says he likes me and wants to be with me but he could take it or leave it I ve been trying to rationalize it and he s right I mean I could take it or leave it too it s not like I d die if he didn t want to be with me I have other things that keep me floating on but the sun would vanish from my sky and my soul would wither like a wildflower you know what I mean I ve gotten through worse in my life that I could handle a little heartbreak if that is the risk but do I even want to take that risk with someone who could take it or leave it Arghh I told him I felt we were miscommunicating but nothing really came from that besides reassurance that he likes me I m torn and wishing a massive asteroid collided with the earth so everything would just stop Venting because I lack friends but also looking for any advice,Suicidal Reference
it s a really sad dark really lonely time in my life right now i learned to internalize a lot of things growing up and i m seeing that my hurt is manifesting as honestly just being a nuisance to my friends the very very few that i have at first i was blowing up their phones texting them about how i was feeling and just bringing my negativity into the relationship they were very nice and tried comforting me but ive been down there before and it just happened for maybe a week or two and i caught myself and told myself to stop and not do that again i told myself not to bother people anymore so now i m isolating myself i always have a hard time telling the difference between a healthy amount of communication and too much so im just trying to stop altogether but isolating myself isn t helping at all i m constantly so sad i m very suicidal and i m not really sure what the point of this post is,Suicidal Reference
Dunno if this is the right place but I can t figure out any better places to write I hope this won t end up tl dr sized wall o text I need to vent I ve been seeing a psychologist for about 2 months now I m not officially diagnosed but every single time she s been hinting some instability I looked up the criteria for bpd and had kind of holy shit that s me revelation Almost every point hits home except for a few I don t really have any conscious feelings of abandonment but unconsciously it could explain some of my behaviour And I don t really lash out on people unless I m extremely irritated and even then I m not sure if the magnitude is enough to be labelled lashing out I know feel like I m not the crazy type no offence at the very least Since then I ve been reading prolly way too much about it And last week she said I have probably just been depressed since I can remember I most likely am Even as a kid I was miserable and I ve never really felt in sync with the rest of the World I m like a radio that s tuned just few notches off the station But for once I found something that would define me apart from my finger prints and she dismissed it all with one off hand comment This week I saw a psychiatrist the second time The first time 6 weeks back was great and it felt like I could finally get some answers as to just how crazy I am This time we pretty much just talked about what kind of pills I d like to eat And I can t even decide if I want to drink coffee or tea in the morning Both psychologist and atrist agree that bipolars are out of the picture but she offered me some mood stabilizers nonetheless She said I don t even really fit the depression diagnosis because the intensity of it varies so much and so often And I kind of agree Even at the point where I don t want to exist at all I don t feel the description or anything else written about depression And for example I can t really connect with the people or posts on r depression at all I m frustrated I m angry I don t know what to think I don t know what am I feeling I don t know what I should feel The discrepancy is tearing me apart from the inside I don t know if I m honest with the doctors or even with myself I don t know if I can trust myself I feel like totally different person when talking to the shrinks and e g belittle my drinking Maybe it s a trust issue I ve never really talked to anyone what s going on in my head and I m still uncomfortable being honest about things Maybe I m just mental Now I ve been contemplating for hours if I should submit this at all but fuck it,Suicidal Reference
My mother has BPD and I m growing concerned by her behavior I m the oldest of four siblings my parents are divorced and the youngest child my brother is about to start his senior year in high school For several years my mom has discussed when the last of us goes to college as a time of deep sorrow and struggle for her Recently she s begun mentioning how she ll move out of her house into an abandoned field where she can starve shrivel up and die alone She isn t very social and is generally too timid to be publicly visible unless it involves complaining about something Much of her depression is centered on my father she displays the typical I hate you don t leave me type of attitude toward him Financially she is becoming very stressed because as my brother approaches 18 years old she won t have child support money coming in Alimony payments are now non existent and her job is low paying She lacks much work experience because she was a stay at home mother until divorce I m pretty certain my father resents her too much to offer her any more financial support or at the least wouldn t want to deal with the fury such a gesture would generate from his current wife Being that my mother my siblings and I can t afford to pay for her to receive therapy she went for ten years when married to my father but it was mostly ineffective I don t know how to help She takes anti depressants and does not have a history of suicidal behavior but she also has only spent one year of her life away from any family or a significant other her first year of college after which she transferred schools to be closer to home She has gained a lot of weight since divorcing my father mainly due to binge eating ice cream cakes and other sweets Do any of you have suggestions for how to approach this situation It s been a thought I bury in my mind but as it gets closer to when my mother will start living on her own I m becoming more stressed and scared,Suicidal Reference
I was diagnosed with BPD a year or so back I am in my late twenties now and for a long time was completely out of my mind My SO and I have been together for 5 years For some reason with him is where I really went off the deep end About 6 months to a year into the relationship I started to exhibit crazy behavior drugs violent episodes suicide attempts etc This went on and off for about 4 years I won t sugar coat how bad I was to my SO I was violent with words and physically I never cheated but I hurt him in so many other ways I believe he stayed with me because of my undying loyalty to him Again having BPD I get very attached and once I fall in love I can t let it go I had past relationships that ended but I never really lost it but with my current SO I could never lose him that is how co dependent I am Eventually it reached a point where it was so bad cops were being called I was making so many serious attempts even in front of my SO s friends My SO kicked me out and broke up with me I pleaded and begged for forgiveness because while having BPD isn t an excuse to do any of the things I did I truly do love my SO and I wanted to change for my SO and myself My SO agreed to take a break for a month and see I immediately started therapy and I actually quit taking all the psych meds and got better I made so much progress we are now back living with one another I am no longer violent I haven t made one attempt in a year and overall much better However even with all my progress I sometimes feel that my SO has stigmatized me For example anytime I have an emotion or cry because I think my SO treated me unfairly or because I am worried about our relationship my SO will either immediately blame my BPD ignore me to train me according to my SO or he will flat out tell me I am emotionally manipulating him Even in other instances if I buy some cookies and bring him some too he thinks that I am manipulating him to eat the cookie so that I dont feel bad about my bad eating habits or maybe I want him to get fat to bring him down he is very dedicated to his fitness He tends to think everything I do has some secret motive or manipulative factor Where honestly I feel like I am just being nice or trying to work things out I know my BPD will always play a part in my life and actions but I feel I can t escape the stigma Where now everything I do is analyzed in the worst way as if I am this manipulative person Or am I being manipulative without even knowing it,Suicidal Reference

I have this stupid fucking problem where I m always convinced my boyfriend doesn t love me that he s about to break up with me that he s just with me as a joke I don t even know It s so stupid to think and I know that but I m so paranoid about it anyway I m a really affectionate person when I m in a relationship I love physical contact I love saying and receiving sweet words I love just hanging out and watching shitty movies with someone as long as I m with them If I like someone I could spend all my time with them and never get bored My boyfriend is more reserved he s just not the affectionate type though he s very sweet when we re alone and cuddling He s just not the type to get as attached as I am everyone shows love in different ways and I know that but I can t shake my paranoia I feel like I m always the one who wants him more I m the one to text first I m the one calling him or begging to hang out he could probably go three days without texting me if I didn t text him first probably a week without hanging out I feel like I m always putting in the effort to contact him and it makes me seem clingy and obsessed but I m afraid that if I wait for him to text me or invite me over first I ll never see or talk to him Whenever I do contact him I feel like I m annoying him In the past week I ve called him three times at midnight because of panic attacks and he says it s fine but I m afraid I m driving him away I m afraid he s going to break up with me or stop loving me and it hurts me so much because of this fear There s something inside of me telling me I need to show him how much it hurts me by making him hurt and of course this voice tells me that cutting myself with make him see but I m trying to smother this voice because I don t want to do what my ex did to me I don t want to be a shitty person and I don t want to be clingy and annoying I know it s annoying to constantly ask do you still love me do you still think I m pretty Do you even enjoy spending time with me but I want to so badly just so I can know I ve seen him twice since we moved back from college last week and both times he doesn t seem to want to kiss me There s probably a better explanation for it but my stupid mind and stupid feelings won t think anything other than that he hates me and thinks I m gross and ugly and he s going to leave,Suicidal Reference

To Daughterxo or something like that who posted here three hours ago I only saw your post now tho I was typing this but when I pressed comment figured that you deleted your profile which is probably a throwaway account but I m sure you re still browsing through this subreddit and hopefully you get to see this I completely understand what you re going through and is extremely sorry that you have to encounter such situation I used to think that way too that I have no hobbies or interests or talents or friends or sanity or appeal at all and that nobody cares about me and that so called friends just don t want to tell me to back off even if they really want to the last one is true sadly But there has to be something and at least one or two people who actually care about you they re prolly just unaware or is just waiting for you to approach them you just have to open up to them Err I don t really know that s what I think at least I m glad you re seeking for help and is willing to get better Be strong don t kill yourself just yet You re right we re not supposed to be suffering and feeling so much pain loneliness and the urge to die but what to do this is the life we re supposed to live There has to be a solution tho jeez took me so long before I could actually gain the ability to be positive I wish I could help but I myself is still trying to cope up with everything and fix my life at the moment I hope you feel better soon hugs,Suicidal Reference
Hey all I d appreciate any hints or tips about ways to distract yourself when you re having destructive thoughts that are difficult to break My immediate response is to hit the drink when I need to make myself stop thinking but that leads to other issues like being more likely to self harm and blow up at people who don t deserve it I d kind of really like to stop that pattern if I can help it I ve tried some things like grounding and mindfulness but I honestly find it so difficult to calm myself enough to focus and get any real benefit from them I m going to keep at it because I know it can be hugely useful once mastered but I d like to know if anyone has developed or been told of any other techniques that can come in useful when you really need to just shut your brain up and prevent yourself from turning to drink or whatever Thanks,Suicidal Reference

I tried to kill myself two times in the past month and I just don t know how to change because BPD is the Fucking Worst I want to be a person who s emotionally detached to everything but not due to dissociating Someone who can talk to someone even ones they like without kissing their ass Someone who doesn t get internalize all of their feelings until they blow up by themselves and either attempt suicide or severely injure all of their inter personal relationships by splitting I have no real friends everyone is just fucking putting up with me because they know I m mentally ill and don t want to feel any guilt for telling me to fuck off because I m annoying And while I know they do that I still attempt to talk to people because I am so alone and grasp for any attention I have no hobbies or interests or talents or friends or sanity or appeal at all Should I die and see if reincarnation exists so maybe I ll be less fucked up in the next life or should I just suffer every single day for the rest of my life I don t think teenagers are supposed to feel so much pain and loneliness and urge to die So how can I change when I m a teenager and I live with my abuser and neglectful parents that cause me to constantly dissociate in order to protect what little sanity I have How Thanks for any help or advice I want to change while I m young so I don t die before I have a friend,Suicidal Reference
Every time my life starts to look up and I get a taste of normalcy and happiness it just blows up in my face I fall lower then I was before I hate it I hate having this disorder I hate being this way it seems no matter how good I am at coping or how well therapy is going it doesn t matter in the end because the borderline bitch always comes out and has to ruin it all I just want to fucking die because there s no point in reliving the same cycle of pain and bullshit over and over again,Suicidal Reference
What I have the most trouble explaining to random people even health care professionals is just how pervasive this dissociation is Even when I am doing something it never leaves my mind I ve always felt like I don t know what or how normal people think or feel I m always watching and trying to follow social ques without really understanding organic emotions even when I m extremely sensitive to other s feelings and can sense them intuitively in others It s like I can never turn off the rational logical computer processor part of my brain so the subjective emotional part never has a chance to come out So here s what I mean even when I m talking to people and having a fun time I really don t feel much of anything in the situation or about the people around me and I know it in the moment Even when I m at a concert I can t shake the fact that I don t feel much of anything even at my favorite bands When I worked out or had fights in Taekwondo tournaments I feel completely detached from the moment and a lot of the time it seemed like my adrenaline never really matched what I imagine it should be When I drink I don t feel or think any differently because basically I never feel anything I have a sex drive in the sense that I generally think I want to have sex with people but when it s happening I can t turn off the thinking part of my brain Nothing is fluid or natural and I m distracted by how bizarre and awkward it looks half the time while having sex and I definitely don t feel any level of emotional aspect so I end up not even enjoying it I don t get excited about vacations good grades babies whatever Relationships don t work out because 1 I m afraid of what has happened in the past I don t develop any feelings even months into dating each other and 2 texting is even more cold and lifeless than face to face interaction but most girls seem to want to message for weeks before they even consider a first date in person Just doesn t mesh well for me where I m at I ve never really considered myself suicidal because I don t really fantasize or think about outright killing myself But honestly recently I ve had the thought that I m only not suicidal because I don t even feel alive Anyway I forget why I posted this out Did I have a question Just frustrated It seems like a lot of people here and a lot of people with depression in general still have significant others and many many will still use sex to try to alleviate or distract from their bad feelings as was the case for the great majority of girls I ve had sex with I just can t relate to that at all especially not about sex It s really alienating for me And I can just tell based on what people say after I explain this is that they just don t understand it or it s severity and pervasiveness Quick edit I am a cismale and I tend to see a lot of female posters here and I think there s a handful of subtle differences between the way different genders describe their general experience with BPD especially sex The way sex is socialized to different genders is very very different and maybe there s intrinsic differences in the way it s perceived too So just keep that in mind,Suicidal Reference
I m so fucking alone I hate myself I hate my life But I can t fucking change any of it I work two jobs to support my older sister and myself I m tired I m miserable I m angry My nights are spent binge drinking my days are spent working recovering I don t have friends I don t have anyone to lean on I keep looking for hookups so I can pretend to feel something with someone I see everyone on my social media s having fun trying new experiences living life I m only 18 but I feel more like 45 I can t break down I can t give up but the idea of jumping off my apartment building is becoming more and more of a threat I need help But I don t know how Tldr I m a big crybaby,Suicidal Reference
how could you leave me without a word I don t even know if you re alive how could you think this would be the right way to do it I can t take being abandoned anymore it feels just like when my dad died every single time how could you not give me closure you filled up the emptiness inside of me and now that you re gone I have no desire to live I don t want to be this way but it keeps happening to me I will never be accepted into a loving family like yours you gave me a chance and I ruined everything I just want to be loved for my soul and you saw me and you loved me and now you have ripped it all away I was finally happy but not it is gone and I am a 22 year old failure I love you with my entire being and I know it isn t healthy but I don t know what to do I don t know how to be normal and everyone who is just seems so shallow I don t know how a love like ours just wouldn t be enough I don t know what to do I will be waiting forever to hear from you I just want you to tell me that I m good enough,Suicidal Reference
Just for reference not diagnosed with BPD as just starting my treatment journey and acknowledging that I have issues Just many of my issues overlap with those of BPD though I am hoping it isn t actually what I have If that makes sense Feel free to let me know if this means I should be using a different forum So many thoughts rushing round my head I don t know where to begin I thought I was managing then started panicking that I didn t deserve to be on the therapy waiting list if I was doing okay it s already bad enough that I keep telling myself I don t deserve it because there is nothing physically wrong with me so maybe it is just all in my head and doesn t really exist Well I don t need to worry about that so much now I feel I am barely holding on I spent two hours yesterday trapped in a room with one of the people I was closest to in the world before she couldn t be arsed to deal with my emotions anymore and ditched I consequently spent two hours digging my nails into my wrist to the point of bleeding just to try to dull the pain that felt like my heart was being wretched out of my chest I was going to throw up and pass out from being unable to catch my breath I know that this isn t a normal reaction but I just can t stop This one draining weekend has sent me back down the dark and twisty path that I know doesn t end well I have only one friend I can talk to who understands but I don t want to wind up being super clingy and demanding all of the time especially given she has her own problems so I m trying to do my best in easing off a little but I just find it so goddamn hard to act how a regular person would I just wish I knew how to handle and process emotion like most people can instead of it being all consuming and resulting in me feeling like this is the only way I will feel for the rest of my life TL DR sick of feeling fine one minute yet worrying I don t deserve help then in the next breath feeling like I am barely clinging on to my sanity,Suicidal Reference
I just got out of my psych review and I m crying in my car I sat there and she asked me things about my life and I explained them to her I explained how I m terrified I m going to be found out at my job where I can t focus and I barely scrape by I explained I don t feel grown up enough to have all the responsibilities I have I explained how I feel like I ve been drifting this year like nothing has been great how I feel listless and bored and unable to focus at work and I want to go home and then how when I m home I feel the same and I want to sleep or run away I explained how no I don t know what I want to do with my life but I don t want to do administration forever because who does I explained how my boyfriend is lovely but I don t love him all the time and how I pick fights and don t want him to touch me and then five minutes later I love him again I explained how I feel uncertain about my relationship sometimes I explained how I have friends who I love in real life but hate online whose faces and typing styles make me feel sick I asked about what s wrong with me because I ve been asking for ten years and she asked what I think and I said BPD because people keep mentioning it and depression because I m not fucking stupid and Im actually diagnosed with that one and anxiety because I used to get panic attacks and maybe other personality disorders because fuck who knows She does She asked what I wanted to do with the rest of my life and I said I didn t know Then she told me it was all about timing and that I need to figure out what I want She asked what I thought would help me and I told her I didn t know She told me that I keep mentioning BPD and yes she can see how I would identify with that but in her opinion my main issue is that I am terrified of needing people She offered me group therapy long term or individual therapy with a trainee for a year or no therapy at all i told her I didn t want to do group again I hated it last time and I didn t want to do psychotherapy with a trainee when the trained psychotherapists didn t help me last time I saw them long term She said I should think about it and let her know within six months otherwise I d have to be referred by my GP again I told her that I didn t think I d be in touch because if she was leaving it up to me I don t think I will ask to be put back in shit therapy She said she disagreed and thought I would be in touch I told her I was sick of other people getting told what s wrong with them by basically reading off a list of symptoms and I have been asking nicely for ten years and not doing the wrong thing and no one will tell me She said it was clear that I hate people and I m terrified of needing them and repeated the timing thing I said it s not fucking timing it s not knowing myself How is that fucking timing She said the session was over and I left One of the girls from my group was sitting downstairs waiting for her appointment and I said hi but needed to get out of there and now I feel bad for not spending time with her I won t call because I feel like it s been confirmed to me that I m not worth NHS time I ve been under the care of the personality disorders team for three years and they haven t helped me so now who can Fucking no one I give up I don t see the point of relying on anyone or asking people for help even the people paid to do it won t or can t help me I m done with them But that leaves me in this shitty situation where I don t know how to move forwards only slide backwards I don t know what to do,Emotional Distress

Hey y all so I was recently not diagnosed but we need something to bill insurance for and have been diagnosed bipolar since I was a teenager 25 now I m medicated and don t get manic really anymore but do get depressed as hell I ll be starting DBT as soon as my therapist can find a group in the area that she thinks would be a good fit for me I was just wondering if there are other people here with bipolar how DBT might or might not be useful for bipolar symptoms as well and maybe if anybody has recommendations for somebody newly possibly diagnosed but they aren t telling me Sorry if there are already a million posts like this I haven t been to this sub before If this is a redundant post referring me to another helpful one would be nice I ve checked out the self help post and the r DBTselfhelp and also already happen to have a few books about BPD because I wrote my undergraduate thesis on young women writing their experiences with mental illness So I m not coming from a place of total ignorance just wondering really if there are others here with bipolar Thanks,Emotional Distress
and having BPD Like I got some really good news today that I got something published I m happy but what I m happy about is ppl sharing my article and facebook and shit I m like getting high off people sharing it and stuff because of the attention It s not even about getting something published really Like I didn t feel happy until saw people sharing it It s the craving of the attention and people sharing it as the reinforcer I still feel kinda numb underneath But increasingly excited when I see people share it and like it on Facebook,Emotional Distress

So I broke up with my therapist Typical bpd behavior I guess I was sitting there talking mother father issues as usual he said I seem different and I said I want to end the therapy And he wanted to know why and he was really confused He seemed disappointed He wanted that we had a proper end one or two more session I said Can I go now And I did I was so relieved But I am sure it was the right decision He didn t support me when I said I rather want to do DBT than psychoanalytic He had the crazy idea I should get off sertralin within 3 days I have been taking it for 10 years And my health insurance did not covering more than 17 sessions bc he is no doctor Maybe I took advantage of him When I got finally the diagnosis I had what I wanted But I was very fond of him before I know exactly the moment when it turned around It is sooo ridiculous so here is the true reason I was the first patient in the morning and while he was in the office I let some air in by opening the windows When he came into the room he said to me he wants that next time I ll wait until HE opens the windows wtf I was so confused angry ashamed Until then I thought we had a good connection And this one sentence that was it I felt like a stupid child I made a mistake I thought now he didn t like me anymore How could I be so ignorant behaving like the boss in his practice And the following session I quit,Emotional Distress
I feel like a different person right now Like even my vision looks different Its brighter and a little streaky I m having intrusive thoughts As I was going home I kept noticing that ppl were looking up at me and I thought I was talking to myself out loud and that they heard me and that they re going to tell other ppl These are perfect strangers on the street It s like I can t keep me at the forefront right now I m having intrusive thoughts about sex and porn also I ve been using it to self medicate lately I dunno what to do exactly I m not exactly sure what s going on I feel safer now that I m home but I don t feel like myself at all Does have any insight on what might be going on Thanks,Emotional Distress
Where the thoughts I had been keeping in check come back into my head I went to the gym for the first time in a while I feel like the negative voice in my head is somehow stronger in this context I can t focus my thoughts in the moment when I m working out It almost feels like I temporarily lose my identity while I work out I feel paranoid and insecure I wonder what exactly it is It could be that there are so many ppl there I m thinking right now that it brings out the part of me that really craves validation and attention Its an environment with a lot of women around Its about an aspect of my identity that I struggle with being what my body looks like Maybe the gym is just like trigger central for me Its like a lot of my personality just goes away I m gonna try going when its less busy So it could be one of several triggers I guess How do you cope with times like these I think I need to work on nonwritten coping mechanisms because I tend to lean on writing stuff down a lot Can t really do that at the gym Any ideas,Emotional Distress
I started dating this guy and he s amazing We are really similar and suspect he s got BPD but he had a head injury that has left him with some psychosis problems Whenever he goes to sleep he has like minis psychosis episodes He can t be woken up and sometimes these happen at really bad times Like now we have plans and he just passed out and it s making me so angry I know it isn t his fault and he can t help it but what about me Now I m having to deal with a bunch of stress and anxiety without support from him though I m always able to help him in need It worries me that he won t be there for me ever when I need him and that this is just going to be one sided and difficult My BPD is very much managed I see a therapist regularly and have most of my symptoms under control But this new relationship is testing my coping mechanisms and showing me where I still need improvement How do I deal with this welling rage and sadness Coping mechanisms,Emotional Distress
I m lucky enough to present at this big conference in June First time doing something like this I rehearsed just now I am on hypervigilant alert for negative thoughts They started coming right before I started the rehearsal I used seroquel to sleep last night It made me foggy as hell So I think that influenced my first rehearsal I was a little short on time I m able right now to not follow any of these thoughts and just write them down It didn t help that I was looking at my stopwatch a few times so I knew I was going too fast That probably influenced this But the thoughts were just insidious Just having them come up in my mind and not reacting threw me off the presentation Is anyone else amazed at how nasty it is when you start tracking them I feel capable I will add more slides or I will simply do the same thesis presentation I realize that I should have simply presented my thesis entirely instead of focusing on one section The bully in my head had a lot to do with that no you cant do the same thing twice Whats wrong with you I m going to email the conference right now to ensure that they would be okay with it So I did and the voice is now telling me I should have given them more time Mental Filtering right My mind takes the bad and tells me about it and forgets about the good It amazes me that we can t even do anything at all sometimes No matter what it s there I m glad I m getting better I m glad I recognize,Emotional Distress

I feel really anxious I am having a text conversation with a good friend that I don t talk to much I don t talk to any of my friends much especially on the phone I ve been in therapy all year for PTSD BPD I ve already been dealing with a lot of feelings that make me think I m a phony or a wuss And now telling an ex marine that I ve been bad about staying in contact with makes me feel terrible My first reaction was to text another friend about it but I am bad about staying in contact with my other friends and only one of them knows The only one that knows is recovering from having nine teeth pulled in anticipation for a kidney transplant so I d feel dumb bothering him with my petty stuff right now I told my gf about it but she s at work and I talk to her everyday anyway and am lonely despite being in our relationship My best friend died last summer and it has really made me miss friends besides my gf So the phone has vibrated a couple times and I m to anxious to look at it Okay rant over,Emotional Distress

This happened yesterday I made a post on facebook about how hurt and angry I was about the stigma around BPD like how people tell my boyfriend to just leave me and things like that And one of my friends commented something like Why are you focusing on the negative Don t focus about the negative unless you re going to do something about it Lots of people support you focus on that instead While I understand how good intentioned that comment was it hurt like hell and felt invalidating as hell I couldn t help that the stigma I saw everywhere hurt me and I had a right to feel bad on it It s never helpful to be told to just focus on the positives that s like telling a depressed person to just be happy or telling someone when something s bothering them just stop thinking about it And it just felt like I wasn t allowed to feel bad or something and it also felt like she was blaming me for not just focusing on the positives Part of why I m posting here is I figure this forum is the only place where there will be other people who understand Because after that I posted a really polite and thought out response explaining how I knew she meant well but it came across as invalidating and therefore wasn t helpful But I still couldn t get over it and I ended up crying for hours over it And unfriending her And even today I can t help thinking about her comment and I want to cry I just can t get over it Am I overreacting Well probably I am But I can t help it and I wish I could just forget about it The rational part of me knows it was just ONE LITTLE COMMENT that didn t even have bad intentions behind it but at the same time I can t get over it at all and now I don t know what to do I guess I m just looking for some support and understanding right now because I know it s part of having borderline that makes me react so badly to things like this I just feel so helpless like I m trapped by my own emotions and I can t get away,Emotional Distress
So I had my heart broken literally to a song It s a popular song and even though it s been a couple years the song would sometimes be on the radio or playing at the mall etc I used to just block it out but a few days ago I heard it again and today I thought I might try exposure therapy and actually just went and watched the specific performance to the broadcast of which I had my heart broken Well now my heart physically hurts This breakup actually resulted in me getting these chest pains for the first time since I was a kid my actual heart is or at least was last time I checked fine so the pain probably comes from the distress and now with my attempt at exposure therapy the heart ache is back yet again not the metaphorical heartache but the actual ache pain in my physical organ heart I just don t understand why I am so sensitive and how to cope with these emotions The breakup is old and although I did have very hard time getting over it I like to believe I am mostly over it and been over it for at least 6 months And now the heart ache it s a physical reaction to this song which seems to still mean so much pain to me How sad and how unfair I don t want to feel this way and I don t want to care so much,Emotional Distress
I just don t know what to do Ignoring them and moving on doesn t help but accepting it only makes them seem more normal and acceptable Any responses are deeply appreciated Does hypnosis help Does meditation help Does reading free self help books help Please feel free to tell me Also Please do not recommend DBT therapy or medication I m young and do not have a job money or any emotional or financial support system,Emotional Distress
It seems like please don t tell anyone is a foreign phrase Nobody will keep your secrets And if they do it will only be until they piss you off or until you piss them off Then they ll become poisoned with anger and will try and spite you in the worst way possible Trust me,Emotional Distress
about a year ago I told one of my best friends I didn t ever want to talk to her again I felt pain whenever I talked with her because her boyfriend hated me for some stupid reason and every day she seemed more and more distant I said some really hurtful stupid things I shouldn t have said My other group of friends stood up for me when her boyfriend went after me and tried to screw things up for me Now it s been a year and those friends that stood up for me that also did some realllllllllly screwed up things to the girl hate me because I wouldn t be manipulated into turning on another friend of mine so I left and joined that other friend s group Thing is the girl I told to never talk to me again and her boyfriend are two of the main people in that group I feel like shit for all of the things that I said and I have for a very long time so I wrote out a long and heartfelt apology text since I won t see them for weeks or even maybe months saying how much of an idiot I was but I can t bring myself to send it I don t want to reignite the issue but I don t want to seem like I m too proud to apologize What the hell do I do,Emotional Distress
My mind has been so clouded for so long that I can t remember the last time I had like just a pure thought about a friend I m pretty much on auto pilot with this stuff Like I know how to fake it and all that Like with my mom its auto pilot the whole time I know what she wants to hear I know how to respond to avoid conflict So I just numb out But honestly I was a little surprised I thought to myself I hope he can stay off drugs because hes in a half way house right now That s all it was But I saw the difference right away it was honest,Emotional Distress
I just started college and my boyfriend ended up buying my books because I coudln t afford them and couldn t start without them The inurance ran out on my car and I am needing knee surgery just so I can do basic things like walking normal distances but I can t afford the copay My boyfriend has offered to give me the money for that too but is is his last 200 and includes some of his birthday money I m on disability but can t seem to make ends meet and I am terrible at prioritizing things I m an adult not even in my 20s anymore and I am still struggling I get paid on the second but still won t be able to catch up My surgery is scheduled for the 28th before I get paid I m a fucking failure as an adult,Emotional Distress
I ve got my first date soon with a girl I ve been talking to a lot I m enamored obviously How do I chill out and not scare her away I m afraid I ll go overboard cause of the BPD stuff,Emotional Distress
Is that I ve realized that so much of my hyperactivity is driven by the negative bullying voice in my head Everyday I was driven to complete as many tasks as humanly possible and if I didn t I felt like a failure Even if I did I would still risk feeling like a failure But I ve come to understand that as a symptom feeling like who you were was only dependent on what you got completed today Fuck that drove almost to insanity that voice Right now it s trying to tell me the same thing Why aren t you working on your presentation this very second Because I m eating lunch and I want to relax for a little while fuck off,Emotional Distress
I just can t seem to kick it Its been 4 years now Another day off work Another piss soaked bed Another wasted day of puking and shitting Every time I tell myself that I m not doing it again and every time I just end up on a week long bender I did rehab but they had no consideration of BPD and I struggled I can socially drink no problem I can have a few pints with friends but I can t seem to kick the alone binging Drs all tell me this is a form of self harm but I don t know how long I can fool myself into pretending I don t have a serious problem A year and a half ago I was dragged home from living alone with my dad having to clean up his grown daughters piss and vomit soaked belongings Last night he had to do it again He can t keep doing this for me I have a boyfriend now and I can t keep passing out on him or fucking him when drunk I have a job and my own business I can t keep missing days off I am so desperate but I dont know what to do or where to turn I didn t like AA as I know I have the power to change I know its going to come from me but I just don t know what to do anymore,Emotional Distress
It s been very hard to find It almost seems like my only option is going to the States and paying thousands of dollars The only treatments I can find are year long outpatient centers in other provinces which isn t an option,Emotional Distress
I hate this stigma It makes me doubt myself It makes people look at me like I m just some dramatic asshole It hurts to think people I was close to but don t talk to anymore possibly are looking back and nullifying all of our good times and close moments by thinking he was just crazy I hate to wonder if I ve possibly scarred someone I don t think I was that bad to be honest I ve never hurled insults or anything at people But I was needy and if someone wants to view some of my past behavior as purposeful manipulation it can totally look like that It goes to show how sick I still am that it hurts me this much that people who actually loved me might hate me and want nothing to do with me because I hurt them I didn t know I was sick then I just want to be healthy I don t want to unknowingly manipulate people I love I had such a shitty childhood that I just haven t really lived a normal life I want normal relationships I don t want to be looked at as dramatic When the strong emotions of fear and pain and possibly being abandoned or hated come I just despise myself and can t control my actions properly I m just going to be a fucking hermit until I m better from now on,Emotional Distress
I am about to walk out of a 7 year relationship with a patient loving man because I have fallen in love with someone who thinks I am amazing perfect etc I know that he does not know the darkness in me yet I know that I am buzzing from the validation and excitement I don t know what to do Being alone is not an option at the moment I live with my SO and don t have somewhere else to stay Also the only person I want to be with when I feel so broken is my SO Help,Emotional Distress

I have a double whammy with my Asperger s and my BPD which results in me never knowing what people are feeling thinking I have paranoid traits and this along with not knowing the above winds up with me being extremely scared of people This fear is currently keeping me from finding a new job I don t go outside or volunteer because I m afraid that the minute people see me they ll hate me Or I ll be ignored I m so sick of being scared all the time I m really scared right now I m always always scared,Emotional Distress
Many times where I don t express myself or a need I have I basically tear myself up I have a voice inside telling me that I m never gonna be able to be successful because I can t stand up for myself It s not an all or nothing thing I ve spoken up for myself lots of times But if my anxiety shoots up and I avoid it this voice comes up and it can be really strong and I catastrophise a lot,Emotional Distress
Right now that s totally how I feel I m afraid to move stuff in my room out of fear I will get in trouble I don t know what to do next I have stuff I want to do today but I feel like I m not capable of doing it Its like I m sharing the control panel to my mind with someone else,Emotional Distress
Right now it seems like I m talking to myself from the bottom of a well Like my true voice is fading away or going inside my mind Do you think I m disassociating or that this feeling of being deep inside is a trigger for disassociating I m not exactly sure what s going on but I feel like I m in a dream state I m trying not to react cause that ll make it worse I think I m wondering how to improve it cause it kinda sucis,Emotional Distress
One of my best friends growing up well her boyfriend turned husband saw right through me and gave her good advice to stay away At the time I thought he was poisoning her mind with false accusations but he knew I created my own drama and was in a victim mindset Well I tried to reconcile with her That seemed to go well but then we never got to be friends again I saw her at a party and she said We should talk I said Call me anytime That was almost two years ago and I never heard from her I thought about them every single day for a long time Then I let them go Now I am thinking about them again I want to tell her I was diagnosed with BPD I want to apologize I took her for granted I don t even know what else I did to her that she is hurt over I question my own motives for reaching out I do miss her I feel like shit for everything Her husband is was smart I came out to our mutual friend and she said she kind of knew already I was hoping it would trickle down and reach the other friend I don t know if it has Is this all about me I worry about being narcissistic since I was raised by a narcissistic abusive mom Anyways thanks for reading,Emotional Distress
xpost from r polyamory because you guys might have unique insight i m having formatting issues so sorry for the wall of text it won t respond to my attempts for better line breaks Ok so here Äôs the situation long I am 24 years old I currently have had 2 partners The first let Äôs call him A is my high school sweetheart We have been together since we were 16 The second B yes I Äôm very creative is a FWB that evolved into something much deeper We have been in some sort of relationship for about 5 months I love both A and B and exchange ÄúI love you Äùs with both of them They are quite different In some ways I broke a cardinal rule of polyamory and opened up the relationship about a year ago during and ongoing difficult period Things are still hard with A They have been rocky for a long time but there has always been a foundation of trust and wanting to collaborate and work together I love A deeply Things with B are passionate and exciting There are many things that I know objectively would bother me a lot in the long run However I am positively addicted to him right now Like literally The NRE is out of control He gushes about how amazing I am and as much as I know he is also in the throes of NRE I can Äôt help but feel so validated by it It is like a high A sexy cuddly high In some ways I think B and I are more sexually compatible mostly because we have more compatible libidos A is a less sexual person Ä but also we are so comfortable together that he can get me off in minutes so it Äôs absolutely not like we don Äôt have sex and stuff It Äôs just been interesting to be with someone who Äôs a little more Ä ravenous like me So some more context and to explain the rockiness with A I can tell you the facets of BPD that affect me the most unstable sense of identity a propensity for black and white thinking Äúsplitting Äù rapid cycling drastic mood swings and impulsivity sexually financially sometimes substances etc and a profound fear of abandonment and rejection I will make every attempt to avoid losing someone In practice this means that I am an extremely emotionally reactive and volatile person My opinion of an individual especially one that is a friend or loved one less so with strangers is usually all good or all bad Äúsplitting Äù and I can switch between these two interpretations rapidly For example I can be straight up obsessed with someone and start hating them if they say one thing that rubs me the wrong way If someone doesn Äôt answer my texts I assume they hate me and never want to talk to them again and become depressed I will then make frantic efforts to bring them back to me I don Äôt really want comments on my pathology or why I shouldn Äôt be poly because of this because I can Äôt really change my identity I can only try to be as responsible as possible Please understand that I do my best to be self aware and to not hurt people The nature of a personality disorder is that it is very pervasive It is part of my personality It is often pretty much impossible for me to even see it until the damage is done because it is so native to my psyche It is an ongoing struggle It also means that I experience NRE new relationship energy that intoxicating infatuation stage to an UNBELIEVABLE degree Nothing makes me tick quite like positive feedback like attention and affection I cannot stay away I can barely think about anything else When I feel like something bad is going on with B I become depressed It is absolutely unreal It feels amazing even though I know objectively that it is chemical and not a good guide for decision making Anyway here Äôs what Äôs currently going on B is monogamous Well actually A is too so I have to mono partners yeah I apparently want to make my life as difficult as possible Of course for a somewhat jealous person like me this is somewhat comforting To be clear I am open to being with another poly person but I would want to know about it in advance and it would be hard work for me Hard work I Äôm willing to do because of the things that I believe in openness lots of love and trust It is very hard to have a disorder that makes it so hard to live in line with my values sometimes especially as a poly person B and I have identified that we need to transition to being platonic friends It is not sustainable for us to be together and fall more deeply for each other when we will not be able to have a relationship that meets both of our needs In fact today is the day that we decided we would start taking some space from each other I am going away for a bit and he is moving into a new place so it seemed like a natural transition point I am absolutely gutted Saying goodbye to him this morning was terrible I cried He cried I sobbed the whole way home I don Äôt even want to be around A right now because all I can think about is B A has been really supportive all things considered and I am consistently amazed by his near complete lack of jealousy and possessiveness but also willingness to support me through this He is truly a special person who is incredibly kind I Äôm not really sure what I Äôm asking All I know is that I love B I have never been truly in love with anyone other than A so I have never had to move past or get over someone that I love Right now it does not seem possible I keep wondering if I am making a mistake if I should like leave A and be with B Ä but I know that if I did that I would feel like my heart was ripped out too And I might just end up resenting B I don Äôt know Oh one more thing a few days ago after B and I decided that we were going to officially start transitioning away from being lovers B made out with a mutual coworker while out at a club This really pissed me off primarily because B has never been comfortable being around A which I can respect but then engaged in something with someone that I will be forced to be around That to me felt selfish Ä he had wanted distance from my other lover but put me in a situation where I need to see the person who makes me feel so jealous pretty much all the time They are still talking I refuse to tell him he Äúcan Äôt Äù do this or anything like that as I don Äôt feel comfortable acting possessively like that But it still breaks my heart to see it I Äôm a terrible poly person edit to clarify why I m upset he didn t talk about being with other people before doing it and since he is mono I did not expect it It sort of blindsided me given the emotional intensity of our relationship I don t feel like he cheated but I felt like it wasn t extremely emotionally responsible I do believe that he didn t really understand this as someone with no experience with poly and just assumed i wouldn t be too upset We talked a lot and mostly resolved but I am still very jealous and upset that i have to see them around each other a lot I know how fucked up this all sounds Please do not judge me I tried so hard to do this right Ä lots of communication TONS of checking in lots of processing I have been told I am a great communicator sometimes too much so not everyone wants to process as much as I do But still it feels like a tangled mess right now I just sort of want to hear if anyone has ever been in a similar situation I am not going to see B for a week which I think is good I Äôm not sure how much I Äôll be able to avoid talking to him He is one of my best friends right now I am still so stuck on the good feelings he gives me How do I get past this How do you get past the Äúwhat ifs Äù and the wonderings about whether you Äôre missing out How do you stop comparing partners when you Äôre feeling gutted about losing one I feel like a terrible person I really do I don Äôt think I have actively hurt either of them but I am just crushed TL DR Ending relationship with secondary Mental illness makes me confused about this and also my primary I love two people and can t be with both of them and can t stop comparing processing thinking about what to do or how to keep feeling good because I m so addicted to the NRE and shit Not even a good TL DR lol BPD SUCKS,Emotional Distress
I ve only fairly recently come to know I have bpd and I m having trouble explaining myself to others I think maybe it s because I m subconsciously worried that my friends don t want to deal with my behavior but that worry is preventing me from even having a logical discussion My closest friend likes to spend a lot of time on her own and isn t one to stay in touch that well but whenever I try to ask if she can just check in with a text every once in a while so I know she s doing her thing and it s not anything I did she doesn t understand why I want that reassurance She recently cancelled all our plans for a guy she s starting to date and I feel like I can t explain my feelings without sounding like I m overreacting or coming across as overly angry By the time I do hear from people I want to have a talk with I ve completely switched emotions to just being happy they re talking to me and I feel like I m always going to be hiding behind this chill with anything facade from not wanting to bother them,Emotional Distress
Does anyone else really struggle with work Sometimes even the thought of having to get ready for work is really overwhelming for me And then when I m at work and I m asked to do things or change my shifts last minute I feel like I can t say no,Emotional Distress

I have long dealt with my issues that include compulsive lying to my parents for approval disguising my true self to so called friends and dealing with black and white thinking I do yoga regularly as a means of practicing DBT and mindfulness at home My SO and best friend of 7 years is extremely supportive and relates to my situation Before becoming official with her I spent a year single meditating and studying my own behavior to remove or reduce the outcome of certain behaviours I ve identified I had not seen a therapist since my outpatient visits in 2012 I can t claim I ve done a great job but progress has been made Throughout this time I was living at home with my dad who left my mom in 2012 I felt he was lonely and needed the company as much as I did My brother and sister rarely communicate with him and the divorce only hightened tensions between us I was gracious to have his help despite feigning as though my mother and I were no longer talking and feigning the same distaste he shared toward her I would go to learn that he isn t the role model I thought he was To get to the point this is my first post on r BPD and I would love any help or insight into my situation Sorry if I seem all over the place right now I don t normally feel comfortable reaching out to people about my problems My father was always the type to encourage us children to achieve the most we could as first generation Americans My child brother and I both achieved a mass amount of recognition for our abilities and ended up in gifted programs throughout school This set an expectation that I struggle to shake to this day Nowadays I value my own personal happiness above the acceptance of someone else for the most part My parents were always slow to accept a co morbid diagnosis like ADHD which I first started seeking help for at 20 Any psych disorder to their generation just wasn t talked about I understand that My mother is the more understanding parent and over the last few years has come to accept the existence of psychological disorders much to my relief She understands that a medical disorder may be the cause of my underachieving in college and subsequent dropping out She has helped me greatly with dealing with my narcissistic dad My father however is in a unique position to abuse his power after tricking my mom into signing over the house and mortgage into his name after the divorce She is the one who ran the books and ensured our house payments were made on time for 26 years I currently live in the same house while he has remarried a year after the divorce and lives in a second home he purchased for him and his wife He has sent a number of anonymous letters to my mom s new address He has no idea my mom has shared these threatening letters at all He still somehow assumes that her and I don t talk and that I am on his side I have conflicting feelings about how to act toward him I look down upon him for being so petty despite being happily remarried Honestly he s scum in my eyes I see him for who he is not who he pretends to be on the outside I suspect he knows this about me but knowing him he will never mention anything directly It s how he is Growing up he did his best to condition my brother sister and I that he was the good guy My mother doled out the discipline I suspect this was done on purpose to maintain his positive influence on us kids Basically what I d like advice on is what to do with my emotionally abusive dad I m just now seeking a therapist for BPD plus pursuing self education to become more successful It is frustrating to feel that the only way my success is validated is by working 40 hour weeks at my job My SO and I have been taking care of 3 4 of the utilities since he moved out He covers us for the gas and mortgage home insurance payments He loves to lord over my head how I don t maintain the weeds or keep the house 100 tidy I feel like without assuming all the payments I don t have firm ground to stand on and tell him he is not allowed to enter the home whenever he pleases I m shy about bringing up how I feel to his face I think he will invalidate how I feel or just say OK as he s prone to do when I explain my situations to him I always leave feeling like he doesn t truly comprehend the gravity of my situation that I m seeking help or worse yet that he thinks I m being lazy by falling behind on basic household tasks I have schedules to help me with this but it s a steep learning curve I have good weeks and bad Often times my good weeks are a result of pushing myself strenuously and lacking sleep just to maintain TLDR Father is a statue emotionally Communicating my basic needs as a new home owner and maintaining regular communication is very hard since I feel like he is constantly pushing for me to just brush aside my BPD Why is it so hard for me to draft a text or email to let him know I m doing ok I don t understand why I have trouble writing him when that seems to settle him down the most in regards to shutting up about home maintenance etc I know it s in my best interest so wtf Any personal experiences with this kind of mental block would be greatly appreciated,Emotional Distress
Sometimes I feel like all I am is array of empty emotions Day to day the only thing of any significance I have is overreactions to things that don t matter at all Excitement about something I don t even remember anger at something that doesn t matter in the slightest being sad about something tiny that happened years ago The worst is right after my happy periods where I look back and realize there was literally nothing to be happy about I d be smiling about or anticipating something that never existed I spent all of today excited about the weed I just paid for I feel like for a brief moment I actually had something to make this empty feeling I ve had for weeks go away I completely forgot that I don t even if I m going to get it within the month I try not to be too self analytic and avoid tracking my moods it sort of helps with this whole escapism mentality I have but I feel like that just makes me dissociate even more Is it weird that I was happy when I got my diagnosis I almost feel like I went out of my way to convince myself I had this disorder just for a sense of definition I feel like I only fool myself into thinking I have it so that I m not sitting in this room by myself lonely for weeks on end with absolutely nothing just feeling like I have this disorder makes me feel like I actually have something Then I realize how sad that thought makes me feel I get happy that I m not just inventing this idea that I have it then angry at how much I m swinging without noticing and then sad again at the thought that s it s never going to get better Even my writing is so chaotic I couldn t decide whether to end with this sucks or at least I have something,Emotional Distress
How many people feel like they literally just never had a family growing up and to this day I mean never felt loved or accepted Missed so many small simple things like coming home to find dinner waiting staying up late and laughing and playing games watching each other grow and learn and experience life Hopefully that makes enough sense,Emotional Distress
When I get really depressed I get sick and throw up when I eat and when I m in one of my good moods I eat too much but don t vomit it up I m normally between 190lbs and 220 lbs It fluctuates depending on what happens Based on how tall I am I m only a bit bigger than I should be I don t eat to much or stop eating because I m scared of my weight but because I physically get ill when I m depressed and my appetite goes way up when I get in a good mood I talked to my therapist about this last week and she said that it wasn t good to do this but it s not really causing much harm so she didn t care I agree with her but I m still curious,Emotional Distress
I m starting to feel like totally giving up on doctors I m seeing a psychiatrist who is really trying to get me to take Olanzapine but I ve refused to take it I m terrified of the possibility of gaining weight I have a history of Bulimia and am currently sitting at my most hefty weight ever I m not working on my eating issues at all because it s been easier to just allow myself to overeat without restraint and focus on solving other problems FTR I have not purged in four months so there is that I ve been on the medication merry go round for many many years so I guess I can see why she d want me to give this a try It s one of the few that I have not been on yet I just don t know what to do At our last appointment she asked me what was more important to me getting better or not gaining weight It was so hard to not walk out after hearing that Anyone else dealt with this kind of situation How did you work through it,Emotional Distress
I recently started kind of dating someone Everything is going fine on paper but the problem is well me I guess He s way out of my league looks wise and he seems very nice so far My self esteem is in the gutter so I start thinking well he s attractive he seems to like me he is nice something must be wrong with him has some malicious agenda or he just wants to use me and things like he s attractive and could get a way prettier and more interesting girls easily so why me Honestly we ve just started seeing each other and I m already thinking of ways to break it off because I m so fucking terrified of being used and left again We met on a dating site and had a brief conversation about what we were looking for and he said mainly FWB but he wasn t opposed to a relationship should things pan out I don t know if that s a good thing or a bad thing but god I just want to bail At the same time I don t want to squander every opportunity because I am afraid I wish I wasn t fucked in the head so I could just enjoy this for what it is at the moment and see where it goes but I just know I m going to grow mega attached way too quickly and get jealous and obsessive when I have no business being like that What should I do,Emotional Distress
No idea if this is the right subreddit but I feel this is related to my BPD I recently got dumped by a person I was crushing on read obsessing over let s call him G who was also crushing on me Turns out his feelings just kinda left and he sees me more than a friend I completely crashed and got angry to be fair to myself he had sounded pretty serious about me when he promised me to get his shit together for me and made plans for me to move in but oh well shouldn t have believed that I guess so he blocked me everywhere A friend of his let s call him K that I barely knew until now asked me what was up since he noticed I was upset In a moment of What do I have to lose I told him the whole story That happened last weekend Now I made plans with K to meet up I met both of them online and we spend most of the evenings flirting sexting Finally it hit me how weird that was Yes I am on the rebound but I am also so incredibly desperate for love and attention I don t actually seriously feel attracted to K I just want this nice feeling back that I had with G And this ALWAYS happens In hindsight the feelings I had for G were not all that nice I was constantly occuppied thinking about him and trying to be a person he would want to date I put in so much effort and he definitely did not It hurt and I was miserable a lot more often than I was happy because I had him But I still wanted to be with him forever and ever Also just to clarify he was not abusive He was just not as committed to the whole thing as me This is a pattern that repeated throughout my whole life I always had intense crushes on people sometimes without actually really knowing them and thought that if we could just make it work everything would be alright When I got into a relationship I immediately started looking out for flirts or maybe something better I am basically constantly looking for someone to date Only recently I realised how much I hurt me and others with this behaviour I would almost say I am addicted to this feeling of being wanted and wanting someone It s disturbing So today I looked at the website of Love and Sex Addicts Anonymous and some of the points on their website really struck a chord with me I really don t know anymore I m just so sick of forgetting life over stupid crushes,Emotional Distress

I asked my father to not call me when drunk and for about a year he complied but then he dropped it and I just honestly don t want to deal with it His alcoholism contributed to the development of my BPD a lot as well as some other problems I have so I thought I had the right to cut him off like this But then to think about it I still am close with my mom who is also no angel and her perfectionism was always pretty bad on me either and some parts of my BPD are def on her I added my father s phone number to the blacklist about two months ago after he called me when drunk and said especially disgusting things I don t know if I did the right thing I feel guilty about this sometimes and wonder where this is going am I not going to talk to him ever now I thought I d figure this out later but later has come and gone and I m still hanging I wanted to call him back a few times over the last month but every time I remember that I ll have to explain why I cut him off in the first place and discussing the things he told me when drunk makes me wanna vomit But I don t want to just let this slide and ignore what he said They say cut off toxic relationships but I love my father and I don t know if he deserves this I think he tries his best Or maybe not My mom says he doesn t try his best he just loves me but doesn t want to change and be a better person for me which I understand but I also feel like maybe I should not be so harsh on him tl dr Two months ago blacklisted alcoholic father s phone number feel guilty about cutting him off like this not sure if it s fair to just stop communicating with him over him not being the person I want him to be he was never a good father,Emotional Distress
My life has completely fallen apart I can t do anything in moderation I am drinking 6 cups of coffee a day chain smoking binging purging on junk food every 24 hours and engrossed in pornography I m only 23 and my life is just complete hell I have BPD depression and anxiety I am scared shitless to face my issues and my life and try to mask it behind all these addictions of mine I went to a DBT therapist last week but right now I can t even muster up the motivation to do the exercises Should I go see a psychiatrist and possibly give meds a shot,Emotional Distress
What should I look for that might indicate a skilled practitioner good match Are there any reliable indicators specific to the first session If something happens that I don t like how can I tell if the person is a bad therapist or just a bad match whom I shouldn t waste my time with or if I m just doing the extremes of devaluation thing and writing them off for a fairly minor thing One of the main things I m worried about is them basically trying to brainwash me I have some very unusual traits that many psychology and self help resources claim is impossible the main one being that I m a victim of severe abuse and bullying but have very good self esteem and don t care about fitting in I m so used to being invalidated and treated like a freak note being treated like a freak not thinking I am one that I can t imagine a therapist believing me I m worried that they d neglect my real issues rage splitting boredom fear of my family abandoning me etc in favor of secretly trying to convince me that I hate myself and want a million friends and a romantic relationship which could not be farther from the truth How realistic is this fear Thanks P S Once I hopefully get some answers I might end up deleting this thread due to paranoia Sorry,Emotional Distress
Hi all I get really reactive in social situations Especially if there is someone there that I want attention from If this person talks to someone else I feel is a threat I just feel really angry and resentful and I start to shut down emotionally What coping skills do you use for situations like this,Emotional Distress
i quit my old job because it was such a triggering atmosphere i got unwanted attention for my looks because the company was 90 percent male they d hit on me stare at my tits and comment about my looks and i just acted like everything was fine my supervisor was so annoying her existence just reminds me of a smelly long lasting fart everyday she d make some kind of ignorant comment starting with the line i don t meant to sound racist but she would ask me about my sex life in front of a male coworker she d micromanage the hell out of my work in a rude way aside from all that everyday was a trigger for me because even the managers liked to poke fun at everything i did it took months and months of telling myself that that s just how other personality types are and it was true they were more extroverted and got along by talking shit i was introverted and sensitive but i wasn t about to reveal that about myself so i wore a mask everyday and pretended to joke around and be fine with everything i played up the part but i was exhausted everyday of my life i grew depressed and even therapy didn t help change my POV this is when i knew that i had to leave that damaging environment because it wasn t me or my mental illness that needed to change it was the fact that i was staying at that shitty job now i m at a new job that i like everyone is respectful my supervisor guides me but doesn t act authoritative she gives me freedom to edit and work at my own pace the male coworkers are nice so far i went to the beach with one of them and all we did was talk about our lives no sexist comments i m having a pleasant time at my new job but i keep thinking about how triggering my old job was sometimes when my new supervisor will call my name i immediately assume she s going to say something mean like my old supervisor did it s like a previously abused person flinching at hi fives has any jobs triggered your BPD EDIT the triggering environment did teach me better social skills though i felt like i had to be extroverted in order to survive there and so my social anxiety has gone down a bit that s the only good thing i got out of the job i know i should have stood up for myself in some aspects but it s hard when the culture climate of the company is like that i also have a problem with confrontation and like to shape shift into whatever i think the other person wants me to be,Emotional Distress
Just got back from a recovery meeting I had something that touched a nerve I felt angry and my mind started racing It s because what I percieved the other person in the situation to be feeling We have facilitators at these meetings and the new co facilitator was more talkative I noticed that the other facilitator that I already know looked a bit irritated because she was participating That s all it took really So I went through all these thoughts that I would normally go through Like first I m judging this new girl right away And I m thinking that the other facilitator must be feeling so hurt Because I know if it was me I would feel something like that so strongly So I m taking my emotional response and applying it to her Which I now know is called psychic equivalence It means that you think everyone else feels and experiences the world exactly like you do So things that I was saying to myself sharing my paranoid and angry thoughts with this facilitator Hugging her and saying it s okay Snapping at the new facilitator BUT I have no idea how she processed or took the situation All I know is that I m believing that she would have the same reaction that I would And that s not fair to either of us That meeting triggered me a few times wow I m noticing all these things now All these reactions I have I ve started to think I ve had BPD a few weeks ago But as I m writing this I m realizing like just in the span of an hour how many things set me off I didn t outwardly respond or say anything nasty I was able to tell myself at the time that it was a psychic equivalence thing Even in my head right now all I can picture is the facilitator as I m writing this This is the type of thing that would make me disassociate and rant and rave in my own head I would pretend to have conversations with the other facilitator I would get angrier and angrier Instead holy shit I wrote it all out here Now I m looking at the emotion labeller thing There s some feelings of jealousy that were triggered Outrage thought Like how dare this new person be so strict with the rules another incident from the meeting I feel combative thought If this person dared try to tell me what to do I would throw a fit I feel obstinate Like I know this girls a bitch doesn t matter what anyone else says I will not change my mind despite not knowing her at all I feel so much better after writing this OMG Sometimes I wonder how the hell I got this far like this But it s a survival tactic it served its purpose and now I want to deal with life this way How do you deal when stuff like this comes up I think I did a good job overall When I get these feelings its like one little interaction builds on another I think it started when my friend at the meeting got a positive reception for a solution to a problem I posed It triggered feelings I had today about a volunteer gig I m doing I need someone to tell me it s okay I know it s okay I m idealizing that facilitator now too I feel like now that I m aware I ve brought a lot of emotions to the forefront Like I m realizing just how sensitive I am and not numbing It s painful Does it get better,Emotional Distress
My week has been off to a fairly good start I had a great therapy appointment great in the sense of a couple of important to me breakthroughs and feeling like I m starting to understand some things but very difficult too I still cry through most of the session especially when he hits the nail on the head It makes me feel like how could I not have seen this But then I try and be grateful that I m getting it now I ve also felt much more productive than usual in my everyday life However I m worried about the rest of the week Most everyone I know is leaving town for the long Memorial Day weekend starting Thursday or has other plans that don t include me not that I ve been very social lately anyway I m left in charge of house pet sitting for several people which is fine However I don t have a lot to keep me busy and I feel worse when my mind is idle and I have too much time to think I wouldn t say it s a regression as far as BPD behavior but I do end up focusing a lot on the past guilt and just generally get very depressed and anxious It s times like these that I miss the person I was closest to most recently and have fallen out with in an irreconcilable way due to my BPD related behaviors That person had struggled with depression and things too and besides cheering me up I felt like I could just be around them So the extra time also can make me focus on what I ve lost in that sense which contributes to more sadness Any recommendations on keeping myself occupied that doesn t necessarily include throwing myself into social situations What do you do when you dread something coming up and need to keep the depression or anxiety at bay,Emotional Distress

I noticed that today after doing something I found a bit nerve wracking today that a song got stuck in my head As I was leaving my house I decided to play music on headphones but NOT the song that was stuck in my head Then I realized something When I got a song stuck in my head it s a trigger for me to disassociate I always do this turn the song on and then have conversations with myself Sometimes they re harmless other times they can get me really upset I want to stop or reduce the habit and be present as much possible So it was nice to figure out that was a trigger If I turn on music that is different from the song in my head it goes away Anyone else like this I guess it s because music has always been there for me Always I associate my life through songs At times they bring back vivid memories and emotions I react to music in the same way I react to triggered memories etc I can recognize a song almost instantly within a second or two My body reacts the same way it might if someone says something that hurts my feelings or makes me happy There s a biochemical change so quick It changes my state of mind almost instantly I m thinking its because so many times in my life music was the ONLY escape To this day I am a huge music fan It s one of the few aspects of my identity that s never really changed although my interest in genres has completely changed I used to cry to music it was the only way I could at times,Emotional Distress
I never even knew it was a thing until a few days ago I saw a post on reddit someone was talking about it and then I found this subreddit and was reading through it and oh my god it s like I can see the light Have I finally found the answer to what I have been desperately struggling with for the past 10 years I have felt trapped in my own head for as long as I can remember My ex just broke up with me 4 days ago because he couldn t handle the emotions of two people He gave me so many opportunities to try and fix it turn it around not be so depressed all the time etc and I always gave him promises that I would get better because I really thought I would but immediately would become this shell of myself again So after he dumped me I packed my things and moved states the next day I ve moved back and forth between my home state and Texas because of relationships I find one in Texas move there it ends I move back I have done this 3 times in the past 6 years Who does that And because of all this moving my finances are shit I had to file for bankruptcy which obviously makes me feel even shittier about myself So now I m back in my home state at my parents house I m 24 years old I have no job and my emotions have become so off the handle since this breakup that I don t even know what to do with myself I was feeling really sad the past few days but I woke up today feeling intense anger and rage at my ex for giving up on me for abandoning me I only have one friend in this state that I can talk to and she s going through a lot of her own stuff I have a doctors appointment next week to get myself into therapy and find a diagnosis I don t know if it s BPD but it sure feels and seems like it I would just really like to have someone to talk to Sometimes it s just a hell of a lot easier talking to strangers,Emotional Distress
I just never think my thoughts are valid and am scared of them coming off as harsh and bitchy This usually stops me from discussing how I feel with friends and I become a doormat out of fear of sounding unreasonable For instance my closest friend has very little concept of time and plans so she ll invite me to do something and then forget she ever did or make plans with someone else and forget that I asked first I feel like a five year old when I try to explain how this gets to me but now she s got a mutual crush and the guy shows up without warning and makes me the thirdwheel to what I thought was girltime or I get blown off for him and then have to listen to her gush about what they did together I tried explaining myself but I feel like I m overreacting and taking things too far and sounding mean when I m not trying to be I feel like I ll always have some jealousy I need to control when my friends give attention to other people but I don t know how to tell when the problem is me overreacting or if there s actually something to discuss I sound jealous and bitchy and don t know how to fix it,Emotional Distress
Been with SO for seven years Recently fell for a close friend He loves me too per his report My primary relationship is open and I have been sleeping with this other friend for a few months Did not know going in that I would fall so hard Now I don t know what to do I am feeling so impulsive drunk off the attention and affect the deeply validating words that make me feel like a goddess Do I just try not to act and ride out the intense feelings How do I bring myself back to my primary partner whom I love All I want right now is to be totally immersed in this new person this friend Fighting the urge to text him trying to get space we ve mutually decided to stop hooking up but I know I could have him if I wanted What do I do what do I do Whhhamcndkx I know this is super ineloquent on phone just reaching out in desperation,Emotional Distress
This is a massive rant but I ve spent a lot of time thinking about these things and there aren t many people who want to listen If anyone at all reads this whole thing and gives me input I d be appreciative I frequently find that the person I perceive myself to be does not match the person other people describe me to be I m wondering if others here have been forced to question whether or not they are actually a reliable source for any information about themselves or their own lives Most recently I ve had people I m casually acquainted with coworkers and my roommate tell me that I m without mercy cold and unfeeling It s really surprising for me to hear this because I experience sadness and pity to such extreme degrees One of my coworkers noted this about me when she told me her friend s boyfriend had dumped her after she became pregnant My coworker was upset for her friend because the friend now feared she had been used for sex My immediate reply was Well obviously she was used and that s really unfortunate My coworker was shocked that I would say such a thing asking me if that s how I speak to my friends I said of course I m honest with my friends they don t come to me for advice and expect a pretty lie because I know that it helps no one Based on this she has repeatedly described me as cold and heartless I don t think that my logical acceptance of reality in any way diminishes the extent to which I feel pain When someone stops talking to me and I suspect or know that I ve been used of course the pain of separation is intense and terrible I ve described it as being emotionally eviscerated without the convenience of dying just living on in the pain I m often afraid of sounding dramatic when I describe my experience with this disorder but I find the words I have tasted madness come to mind most often I feel like it s akin to carrying a person around on your back every single day As if that s not bad enough that person is screaming pulling your hair insulting you kicking you or slapping you on the face Emotions are a daily struggle for me I have just learned that expressing them or reacting to them does nothing so I mostly endure it in silence That being said I m not sure if it s fair to say I m not heartless Yes this is how I feel but are we defined by our thoughts or our actions If I feel sad or sympathetic but refrain from expressing it because it serves no purpose am I still right to call myself an emotional person,Emotional Distress
Okay this is going to be a bit difficult to explain I m the one with BPD and my boyfriend sometimes raises his voice when he s really frustrated at something and whenever he does this it affects me a LOT even if it s not directed at me He makes it sound like it IS directed at me which is why I get upset and then I get emotional and project my frustration onto him For example We are playing a game together online and maybe another player who is a complete stranger is causing our team to fall behind He gets frustrated at that player but when expressing his anger his tone makes it sound like he is yelling at me He raises his voice to the point where he is actually yelling very loudly and no matter how many times I calmly tell him I know I know this person sucks and we probably might lose but we can just start a new game after this He responds with things like NO BUT I JUST HATE IT WHEN WE GET SO MANY RETARDS ON OUR TEAM I don t understand what I m supposed to say or how I m supposed to react because I usually do not rage seriously like that during video game play but his indirect rage tends to make me feel attacked and get upset Then I lash back and tell him well you don t have to raise your voice towards me and I just give him the silent treatment after I usually can t seem to calm down after all this until a day after or so I noticed that when people have inner frustrations towards something or someone and they project it onto me it really takes a toll on me and it s so hard to deal with This is something my mom used to do often but she has calmed down some However whenever she does it I get so upset I cry and I want to throw and destroy things I even get urges to go out and shoplift to just ease my anxiety and rage So 2 questions Has anyone else here dealt with this type of indirect anger and treatment Should I probably date someone who is in general more calm and doesn t really ever rage over things like video games Sometimes I feel like I just don t know how to pick the right guy to be with,Emotional Distress

Hello everyone I ve completed DBP and I still go to weekly one on one therapy I have done so much work over the last year and I am so much healthier than I ever thought possible This time last year I was 50 pounds heavier and had just gotten out of the hospital for the second time in a year I have had a lot of long term relationships but I ve decided that I just want to kind of date around I feel kind of stunted in the dating department since I usually get so clingy and lock myself into usually abusive relationships Anyway for the past month or so I have been going on a lot of first dates I ve made lots of friends and met some great folks but nothing has clicked for me romantically There has either just been friend chemistry or they liked me more than I liked them and I was turned off Do you guys struggle with this That when somebody really likes you that it turns you off and when someone is sort of disinterested it makes you crazy about them I went on a great first date last night I had been talking to the girl for about a week There were times throughout the week where we talked A LOT and then days where we didn t talk at all She seems kind of disinterested in me but we both agreed we had a great time on our date last night and made plans to go on a second date in a couple of days but we haven t really texted much since the date and I haven t heard from her today it s only 1pm here I guess I am so used to jumping in 1000 miles an hour that I am not sure if this is normal I think this seems like a normal boundary seeing each other a couple times a week moving slowly but for me it feels really cold and I m taking it personally and finding myself ruminating and overthinking and feeling rejected Does this happen to anyone else If the other person doesn t become super dependent when you want them to do you feel rejected I am really trying to work on boundaries Feel like a nutcase Btw this is a lesbian relationship so I m not sure if that affects it I mean the famous lesbian dating joke is what do lesbians bring on a second date A U haul so the lesbian urge to merge is a real thing but I also know my bpd co dependency is a huge factor in this help,Emotional Distress
Sometimes I feel that most articles and books about BPD largely focus on the more apparent extreme outward behaviors of the illness ie self harm attention seeking suicidal threats screaming and crying fits etc As a frustrated BPD sufferer who has made quite a bit of progress through DBT with controlling outward behavior for the sake of others I just wish I could find some more help with some of the internal day to day constants For me mainly unstable unclear sense of self identity complete inability to choose a major career sometimes feeling alone in an empty mind etc Does anyone feel the same or have some insight to offer on these things This has honestly been what has hurt scared frustrated me the most in my life Sometimes I just don t know what to do because I m always waiting on these things to get better Thanks in advance for any input,Emotional Distress

Does anybody else find themselves falling into this role with their social contacts Anyone else feel like they intentionally or unintentionally thrust people into the role of being their savior when some sort of crisis usually something pretty minuscule occurs in their lives I keep doing this and I just can t seem to stop I overreact to so much stuff that happens in my life and find myself crying out for help all too often I don t even seem to consciously realize I m doing it until it s too late then I feel like shit and I go to apologize to the person which most of the time only seems to make things worse This puts such strain on my relationships and has unfortunately has destroyed several that I felt were pretty meaningful I really want to stop this I know it s unhealthy and toxic towards other people and I know I have a problem The only problem is I have no idea how to fix it How does one go about solving this behaviour and catching themselves in action before any damage has been done How does one go about doing damage control when they know they ve fucked up,Emotional Distress
Before I say this I want to make it clear that I m not asking for a diagnosis or anything of the sort I just could use help on this I ve recently started thinking that I may have Avoidant in addition to BPD But I also know that people with BPD tend to self victimize and convince ourselves that we are worse off than we really are But I think I could fit the description and I d like my psychiatrist to evaluate me for it Getting my BPD diagnosis was huge for me allowing me to make tremendous progress so if this AvPD were a correct diagnosis I m thinking it d be very helpful Problem is I am afraid to do that because I don t want to be wrong I feel like if I am wrong I will come off as just whiny I realize that may be ridiculous after all she s my psychiatrist but I guess I just wanted to hear that from someone besides me Thanks,Emotional Distress
There s this person I ve wanted to see romantically for awhile I asked them for help on a project I was doing I really wanted to ask them out just for coffee but I got anxious I guess I felt safer asking for help on a project Anyway I emailed this person today and actually told them that I need a couple of weeks because I m busy right now I m proud of myself Usually I m like Unless I see this person all the time they re going to completely forget I exist Or I love you why would you not want to see me I m learning what these symptoms mean I actually emailed this person awhile ago and didn t hear back right away OMG I felt so rejected My emotions were up and down like crazy thinking about this person becoming like overly elated and excited because I thought they might have liked me and then being disappointed because they didn t email me back right away Someone told me that nobody intentionally doesnt respond to hurt your feelings Even right now I can feel my thoughts shift to like they re going to like someone else better I m flashing back to memories of being unable to talk with the opposite sex when I was younger Thinking my friends were better at this sort of thing then me Feeling paniced and anxious Then thinking that I can never introduce my friends to this person or they will steal her away I ve never really written about this before this is the first time So all these thoughts and emotions are coming up I ve already jumped the gun just by the end of this post I ve gotta give myself a break I m really new to dating after avoiding it for the last two years It s going to be a work in progress What tips do you have for these situations Like contacting someone and not hearing back Or being afraid to ask them out Or thinking they re going to like someone better I m really apprehensive with knowing what to do in these situations I want help from a BPD perspective because reading about dating seduction always triggers huge feelings of insecurity and flashback memories,Emotional Distress
I am at a point where I figured out quite a lot about my imposed fake personality through therapy but since obviously my actual personality identity is underdeveloped I have no clue as to what life I actually want for myself I only know what s expected of me The best I managed so far was to eliminate the things I ve been doing because they have been expected from me but were in fact hurting me But farther than that I don t really know I don t know what I want I m just basically scared and want to be safe and not hurt But I don t want to live a life directed and limited by fear I want to live a life I want if only I knew how to know what I want,Emotional Distress
I am in a really isolationist phase right now I m currently on a year out of education because I ve been barely able to function and the past month or so all I want is to be in my own room with my own thoughts I m fine with being on my own in fact I like it a lot However I m in a long distance relationship which means I have to travel to see my boyfriend Whilst I m staying with him I also have to meet up with my friends my old university city which although I don t mind isn t what I need right now More importantly though he still lives with his parents and we are basically confined to his room if we want to relax This means I m constantly around him and when he s out his parents are constantly around We re expected to eat dinner with them every night and I struggle because I have very little in common with them and find it hard to have conversations with them without feeling their judgement What this basically boils down to really is my boyfriends grandmother recently passed away He seems to be dealing with it fine in the past he s said that he often doesn t react to grief and that he was expecting it because she was terminally ill However her funeral is this week and he s asked me to come I haven t left my house barely at all recently because I ve felt too depressed and anxious I m meant to go to the funeral but this means travelling to where he lives meeting up with friends and then the funeral itself where I ll be surrounded by his extended family all day I only met his grandmother briefly and so feel like I ll almost be unwanted there I want to go to support him but as its getting closer I m getting more and more anxious I don t think I can do it right now but I know I need to so I m left with no choice and it s making me even worse mentally knowing that If I don t go not only will I be a really horrible person I know he will be disappointed and his family will dislike me more I really don t know what to do I honestly just want to disappear and for time to stop so that I can reappear when I m ready to face it Does anyone have any advice,Emotional Distress

I only seem to dissociate or panic when I m around my family or their friends I don t trust people who would associate with people like them Strangers and my own friends are great and dandy to talk to on my own I m actually pretty social unless I have a family member looming over my shoulder Then I blindly become really cruel and bitter towards everyone or forget how to communicate other than glaring and sighing it s almost instinctive Sometimes I just flat out flee the scene either running into the bathroom or my room to proceed with a full feel nothing other than racing heartbeat and thoughts panic attack I don t know why I do this but I ve been doing it since I was very young probably 4 6 It s kind of depressing I ve always trusted complete strangers more than my own family and anyone who trusts them Does anyone else go through or have been through this It s horrible,Emotional Distress
This is just an epiphany I had today I don t know if anyone will be able to relate to it but I just thought I d share I think one of the reasons I struggle so much with relationships is because I am capable of so so so much love I think I have a higher capacity of love than almost anyone else I know So when I meet someone and we start dating I fall for them at a much faster pace I want to love love love them with all I have And after so much experience with dating I realize that I can t love them with all they have because they get scared away So I try backing off and get scared because I am feeling something so strong and I need to let out this super strong emotion But I know I can t let it out as love so it comes out as hate All I want to do is love love love love love but my fears and my impulses don t let me,Emotional Distress

I m planning on buying a hamster but I m already worrying about the consequences rather than the benefits What if I hurt it What if it hates me What if it likes someone else which will make me jealous and want to give it away That s happened with every single other pet and actual human relationship I ve had in the past few years Rejection from a pet is just as hurtful as being rejected by a human to me if not more The benefits are that I ll have something besides myself to focus on and I won t be so alone How do I keep my mind on track of this is a creature I need to care for instead of going into it assuming it ll hate me and would rather die than be with me,Emotional Distress
Lately I ve been feeling very disconnected from everything I know that just means I m having a depressive episode because everything is going well for me I have no pressure to finish my degree not financially nor from my university I have friends that I can talk to about anything and they ll be listening for hours if I need Yet I can t seem to get a grip on things I reduced my classes to a minimum I try to spend time on things that I like try to take care of myself and set goals but I just don t have the energy I ve had trouble staying away from alcohol I didn t drink at all until a few months ago because I knew I wouldn t be able to handle it I guess I was right It just seems to follow me everywhere now My memory is getting worse and I find myself being unsure often Maybe I m just a piece of shit after all I don t deserve any of this I m a parasite My best friend thinks I m paralyzed by what happened to me I think there s some truth to it I feel like a deer in headlights Dissociation is a big problem for me but it s embarrassing to talk about because it s hard for people to understand I don t want people to find out how different I really am How worthless I thought about running away from everything but I realize this is nothing I can run from I have the best environment anyone could hope for I m what s wrong with all of this I wish I could just fix myself I m not worth all the leniency and I think they re starting to realize that How can I possibly ask for more help when I have not improved in the slightest It s like I m not even trying to get better I m lost friends and I m not sure I ll find a way out of this What if I m damaged beyond fixing I m not even sure any of this is real anymore I can t be surely,Emotional Distress
I m going to keep this as simple as I can My husband and I have an awesome relationship We re best friends I ve never had such a close friend in my life we have similar goals and interests we have great sex etc We ve always been completely faithful to each other I ve never considered being with anyone else and my husband s words and actions indicate that he hasn t either That said because of my intense emotions mood swings and significant trust issues I was recently 2 weeks ago diagnosed with BPD I come from a family destroyed by several generations of physical and emotional abuse and now even though I ve escaped my mental health is a complete mess Sometimes when I m feeling especially paranoid I snoop on my husband s online activity For the record I know this is wrong I ve told my husband about it and am doing everything I can to make it stop including therapy medication meditation etc Fortunately it s getting better Once when I snooped I found links to his ex s Facebook page When I asked him about it he said he hadn t been visiting her page and there must have been some mistake So we researched the problem together I searched for a random stranger on Facebook just one time and his name appeared about twenty times in the history meaning the browser was just doing something weird Because we did our research and were able to recreate the problem I m confidant nothing fishy was happening Recently something like this happened again I had an out of the blue panic attack started searching for his ex in his browser history and found links to Facebook conversations with her name on them My husband told me he hadn t spoken to her the browser was probably just being weird again I ve chosen to believe because our relationship is so good and nothing fishy has happened before that my husband is telling me the truth our browser is just doing something weird and that s all there is to it Anyone who has BPD however knows that it can be really hard to silence those paranoid thoughts that tell me my husband is lying to me That s why I m here What do you guys do rein in paranoid thoughts Is there anything more I can do than what I m doing meditating visiting a therapist etc Thanks in advance for any help you can give I m really grateful this subreddit exists ha,Emotional Distress
Due to my BPD I am a very anxious person and I also have a history of bulimia slightly binging and then fasting and also had an ulcer a few years back Ever since I got my ulcer my sense of hunger has been way off and to make matters worse I can t eat when I am stressed _x000D_I think subconsciously I still think I am fat and need to lose weight and I have become so accustomed to fasting that I hardly notice any discomfort It has gotten to the point where I legitimately forget to eat for almost entire day until I almost or actually do pass out _x000D_When I try too hard to force myself to eat I just get sick My therapists have just told me to force myself to eat It is becoming a real problem and I don t know how to fix it Does anyone have any advice _x000D__x000D_Edit I legitimately don t find food to be appetizing and that is the biggest problem Looking at it makes me want to gag at times If I could just inject nutrients into my system without eating I would do that which I know is impossible I tried protein shakes and bars but that got old really quickly,Emotional Distress
My ex left a few weeks ago now and I just can t seem to leave him alone All I feel at the moment is a crushing sense of dread that I ll never see him again Maybe I won t logically he s an ex right But that just cannot seem to compute in my head There s always some reason to text him something that I need to say I just want to be with him It physically hurts I know that some of this will be break up related but honestly it was going on for a long time before he left Looking back into our relationship there were moments when the BPD was pushing him away massively I regularly sat and cried for hours if he went out as I was so scared he d never come back ugh I have no doubt that this behaviour contributed in some way to our split and it will probably contribute to future relationship dissolution if I don t get a check on it Just wondered if anyone had any better advice than my current path which is cry when I can t reach him feel better when I do silently dream that he might come back,Emotional Distress
Hi I was just wondering if other people dealt with psychosomatic stuff I mean I assume this is psychosomatic I act in college but I m home I do student theater at my school but I m not sure I ll get any roles next semester But listening to the songs from one of the musicals next semester Heathers the Musical SO GOOD has made me sick physically sick I didn t even listen to it I just saw the cover art on my Youtube recommendations I threw up a bit I assume it s because of my fear of rejection but I really don t know what to do has anyone else had this,Emotional Distress
This is a major issue for me I m just about to graduate school too and I m looking for a job I find that I ll start off keeping really close track of what I spend But then there s something in my head that says fuck it when I m stressed I ll start spending more and more and get really anxious about keeping track about how much I m spending and then I ll get even more anxious When that feeling of emptiness or boredom comes one of my major things is to spend my way out of it I m glad I am starting to notice this It s an impulse control thing that probably has a lot to do with having ADHD also I find I can t stick to budgets either Does anyone have similar issues and what have you done about it,Emotional Distress

So about a month ago my GF was having a lot of issues at home and anyway it ended up with her saying some really weird things about us and about how we should probably be less obvious around some of her friends and family So I did what anyone would do and ask if her friends or parents said anything or didn t like me She just told me to drop it and refused to discuss it further I tried to press a little bit more the next day and she told me that it wasn t worth starting trouble over I tried to ask again a few weeks after that and she just said it was over now and to forget that she even said it Any normal person would have let that go but I m still worried about it for some reason Every time we go without talking for a day or two I get so worried that I feel physically ill How can I just forget about it and leave it in the past I would try to get answers but an argument is the last thing I need right now,Emotional Distress
I have been diagnosed with BPD in a milder sense for about 3 years now and I ve never fully explored it Mostly out of an unnecessary sense of shame which probably stemmed from my best friend at the time treating my explanation of my diagnosis as something that was just in my head Urgh Let s not go there Anyway I thought I d ask if anyone shared my feelings of lust and obsession Basically I have a long term partner and I love him to death He has been amazing for me and I have helped him a lot too But I ve never been in a relationship for this long and I m worried that my old cheeky habits will kick in So I tend to hang around with guys quite a bit I just tend to find them generally easier to relate to But the other day I had a dream that I woke up to a guy that I m studying with and we made out and such this guy is someone that I have classes with but don t hang out with really I ve never been terribly attracted to him either I had mixed feelings about this dream moreso because I know for most people dreams are a silly thing but I have a long running tendency to attach feelings to someone once the idea gets into my head And it has Ever since I ve felt like I ve got this crush on this guy and it s so silly But I can t get it out of my head It brings me back to the days where I could never keep a relationship and I d sleep with whoever let me sleep with them and every guy that came along was my next love Or girl I obsessed over so many of them To the point where they d drive me crazy and bring me to tears because I was that into the idea It was a never ending cycle the crushes and I ve managed to keep away from it until now apparently Has anyone else experienced this And does anyone have any strategies for how I can get these feelings out of my head It s not like I love my partner any less I ve always used every inch of my being to retain a stable monogamous stable relationship with him and it s so far been fine I just have this devil on my shoulder sometimes and it drives me to ruin Thanks in advance,Emotional Distress
I haven t had issues with this recently but I feel immense guilt and am not sure how or if I deserve to forgive myself I m a small girl but I ve punched many significant others and left physical bruises I feel awful nearly all of them forgave me but I feel like an abuser like my father Like I m continuing the cycle Edit My significant other I m currently with has been nearly given a black eye from me hitting him in the face in the past It s been awhile but I feel like it will always weigh on our relationship Like this relationship is tarnished and ruined even though he seems to have completely moved passed it,Emotional Distress

I thought I knew what it was but maybe I don t my psych had told me it was probably anxiety and not paranoia that I was having so that made me confused which was weird to me cause to me what I was describing was paranoia Anyway right now I m really stressed out I have a lot going on right now I m finding my thoughts my initial thoughts for everything are very how do I describe impulse and ready to jump to crazy conclusions But the thing is I don t believe them that much after I examine them But I literally have no control that the first things that pops into my mind is something conspiracy theorist y Like right now I saw I refreshed my friend s blog and it was the same posts as before nothing new showed up Instantly the thought pops into my head he blocked you that s why you can t see anything new I knew that thought was a little too much and I told myself no he probably just hasn t logged on in a while But still it was my first thought I mean it was my first thought and it was intense and lasted long enough for me to deactivate my blog so he won t try talking to me any time soon and I cursed him in my head for a full minute thinking of all the good times we ve had together and why he would want to do something so rude to me But after a while I thought maybe it wasn t the case I also tried downloading something my teacher sent through email and it wasn t working on my computer my first instinct was to think my teacher hated me and had done something so that only my computer out of the entire class wasn t able to download it What s up is that normal EDIT I guess what I m trying to see is criteria 9 is paranoid beliefs believing someone is out to get you It wasn t that I believe it not 100 but it was my first instinctual thought which doesn t really mean to say I believe it so i m confused but i m always scared in the back of my mind deep in my heart or whatever that it s actually true because who knows i dont so is thinking believing,Emotional Distress
I didn t sleep last night This morning I was in my room trying to get through the night I was moody like always I dunno my memory is a little fuzzy but then again my memory of the past always is I think it was sometime between 4 7 am that I was feeling this weird feeling I don t really know how to describe it I had this weird feeling about myself I don t have an identity just a weird ambiguity in my head But when this thing started I really just didn t feel like myself If I looked in the mirror I didn t really connect to what I saw I always feel like this to some extent but it was more severe It felt odd to say things like I or myself or my in my head I just had this vague funny feeling in my body and head It felt like that weirdness you feel when you re spacing our and not paying attention but that feeling was the baseline Everything looked and felt a little funny like the familiarity of everything around me was a little different It all just felt odd A little later I was in the kitchen and suddenly I felt something in my head Like it all just came back down I kind of wished it didn t I hate being sober not some kind of fucked up I fell asleep an hour or two later Woke up around 3 pm and have been up since Maybe ten or twenty minutes ago I felt that weird feeling in my head again but in reverse like something came back on And now I m weird again It s not quite as severe but it s still odd I heard my ma talking to my brother about me from the kitchen but when she said my name it didn t feel like it was me I felt just dead and empty inside My brother was bitching at me and I just wanted him to leave me alone I m still feeling this weirdness now What is it Neither in the morning nor now is because of drugs Edit It also kinda feels like I m looking out of my head or something I also just remembered that during the thing in the morning I had this moment where I looked at my arm and it didn t really feel like mine I whispered my name out and it didn t feel right either,Emotional Distress
I ve been with SO for 7 years We are still pretty young He is an amazing kind smart person I love him However I CONSTANTLY feel doubt I am constantly weighing and measuring things he does in my head trying to decide if I d be happy without him if I really love him etc He is subject to my BPD rage but always bounces back and has been better at setting boundaries recently which hurts but actually makes me feel better like he s not just letting me walk over him i need a hard line sometimes I can t talk to people about these things because for a neurotypical person these would obviously be red flags However I feel strongly that this is at least partially informed by BPD I mean maybe not but I also have a diagnosis of OCD don t meet criteria anymore but still lots of obsessive compulsive characteristics and I just don t think that this is totally separate from my mental health shit how do you deal,Emotional Distress
I think I do this frequently I ll read about some famous person I read a lot of biographies If I read something that even remotely reminds me of myself then I apply it to myself I feel like I do this in an attempt to figure out my own personality but it doesn t work because I only focus on negative stuff usually So it amounts to me just beating myself up emotionally,Emotional Distress

My therapist and I have begun to delve into the juicier parts of CBT At my last session she told me that I would have to destabilize what I gathered is that we will be pushing me to re experience past traumas and to embrace the fear and depression I experience during these sessions When she said the word destabilize my anxiety went from a 3 10 to about an 8 10 She had mentioned in the past that it would get worse before it got better which makes sense to me but I wanted to hear from others that this has been there experience Or how I should approach this,Emotional Distress

The silent treatment going ghost ignoring my messages is the most infuriating thing for me to endure I know it s probably part of my need for control I just think it s so cruel because you have no idea what happened If you go on a date with me and you don t like me at least have the courtesy to say hey I don t think we re a good match and you ll never hear from me again When I get no response I m left wondering what I did wrong or if you thought I was ugly or fat or anything else I can think of and what you re telling other people about me I know most just find it easier to ignore than saying something that might hurt someone s feelings but the wondering is far worse than anything they could say to me Just had to rant and get that off my chest,Emotional Distress
I think a lot of us can relate to feeling like our past self while memories may exist seem like a movie of someone else s life I am trying something over the next few months to try to reconcile what I seem to feel are two different people TL DR at the bottom Background My girlfriend and I have had a very long history I ve known her for more of my life than I haven t For most of that time we ve had some form of romantic connection but we never lived close enough to really be together Because of this we had previously tried to be with other people I had married and had a daughter but my now ex wife had actually exacerbated my BPD to a point where for awhile I thought my whole sanity was slipping away Well now we are together And the only thing that has ever been a constant in my life my now girlfriend is shortly going to be living with me I combined this with some subjects of my dreams and I came up with an idea to bring my present self to terms with my past TL DR I m going to take my girlfriend on a few road trips over the next few months We re going to be visiting places that I hesitate to use the word traumatic but where bad things happened to me Things that I ve tried to repress and distance myself from Its probably going to be very emotional and potentially painful but maybe with her there I can finally bring my old and new self into the same being,Emotional Distress

I have been with my girlfriend for 8 months now and last Sunday she told me she wasn t sure her emotions were enough to sustain our relationship into the future It obviously devastated me and she wanted us to have a break from the relationship So I have been waiting since Sunday for her final answer about it I have tried so hard to respect the break and not contact her all the time but I barely managed to avoid texting her once a day which is a victory for me compared to what I have done to ther girls in the past but I still feel like I am causing her to drift away from me that the relationship is ending any day now because no girl will ever miss me when they don t see me each day at least my brain tells me that So I am sitting here while it s been 5 hours since I sent my text and I just know she is ignoring me now It took four days from girlfriend to ignoring stranger and I just know it s my pushing and prodding and I just want her back but it s too late and I have no idea how to survive this,Emotional Distress
Hey all so I guess this is technically more of a journal type entry but if it helps anyone else or anyone can relate I d love to know Background I ve been diagnosed since 19 I m 26 now When I was younger I was on disability and thought I couldn t work I was working a shit job with shit pay shit hours and shit coworkers that resulted in a few cry for help things Now I m freelancing doing a job I love but recently I ve been booked every week day sometimes with only one day off on the weekend I ll also get called in to cover for other people at places I can chose to say no but the pay is good the people are always different and I like what I do Up to now it s been about a month of this I ve come to realize that it s not about the type of job it s about me I ve started to show traits that I was showing at the shit job resenting working crying from stress they re all out to get me mentality etc Granted some of the people I work for are genuinely douchey but that wouldn t normally faze me so much I think my problem is that I actually need to allow myself recovery time from dealing with people otherwise I start to go insane Call it BPD or introversion or just being me But the issue is that I feel things too passionately so people will say things without intending them to have a lasting effect on me but they do because I feel so deeply about so many issues This means that I come home angry and depressed that people don t understand how the world works or see things the way I do I never argue or anything it s not part of my job and not worth it But I just get sadder and angrier that people can be so careless about what they say and think This slowly results in me not wanting to leave my apartment and hating my job and myself,Emotional Distress

I literally just saw someone say that Borderlines ruin society more than any other group of people The same guy said that depression isn t serious and OCD shouldn t be classified as a mental illness because its incredibly useful He wasn t even trolling He was responding to a question that asked What shouldn t be passed down from generation to generation This user isn t alone I ve seen so many of these types of goddamn posts especially since getting diagnosed I know that the internet is not a friendly place to Borderlines and I know the rest of the world is similar but goddamn I just wish we could convey that we are not what they think we are It makes all of our lives harder when we have to tell our family and close friends about our illness,Emotional Distress
I just as you can tell from the title hate myself I hate every word that comes out of my mouth I hate my personality I hate my appearance which could fill a novel with how much I hate how I look I hate everything about me It s nearly paralyzing I don t want to go out because I know that every word every action everything about me will be judged and it s so terrible I won t speak because I hate my voice and everything I say I literally speak and immediately cringe from regret and hating it You know when you hate someone and everything they do pisses you off And you start looking to pick out things they do wrong I do that to myself I m hypersensitive about everything I hate myself more than I hate anyone and more than anyone else could hate me I dealt with bullying as a kid and teenager but I have a decent social life a great boyfriend my family loves me etc I m convinced everyone secretly hates me because if I hate myself so much why wouldn t everyone else I magnify all of my flaws and I genuinely don t see redeeming qualities I pity my boyfriend because I m such a bad person and he s stuck with me I m so sick and tired of being stuck in this pattern Even if I m having a good day I literally just need to walk out my door and see one pretty girl and my mood is ruined because I see everyone as so much better than me I obviously can t live like this,Emotional Distress
And as I read the title I do realise just how stupid this sounds but I m too scared to be the crazy girlfriend so I can t say anything in front of him and I need to get it out somehow We ve been together two years and at the start of our relationship he had a female friend I think he d only met her a few times who he talked to on the internet and referred to as his best friend He went on and on about her and it became obvious that he liked had liked her So I got drunk one night maybe a year into the relationship and asked him and I d been right Let s add in there that he was incredibly immature when we got together and he thought that bragging about exes was a surefire way to get into my pants Wasn t At all And I covered his shit a lot in therapy But yeah so I know where his exes live which Facebook friends he fancied etc because back then he felt the need to tell me and I was trying so hard to be normal that I didn t dare broach the subject I did eventually bring it up and he was super apologetic because basically he s a more mature and generally better human being now and he does feel bad about all this shite However I still get sore any time these girls are mentioned And the main one they never went out but the one he made it clear he used to like pops up on my Facebook occasionally liking statuses I ve tagged him in and it really bothers me It s like I have to look at her and think this is the girl he would rather have been with than me given the chance You re second to this chick She s ALWAYS going to be his first choice And normally I just deal cos I assume they don t talk any more and he has never brought her up since that drunken night when I asked him about her but then yesterday he asked what my FB notifications were and I told him she d liked a status Then I paused and said So do you ever talk to her any more His response is Not really I said happy birthday to her and that s about it So of course I have to jump on the vagueness Not really About it Are you talking to her or not He says no Then I feel like shit and second best for the whole rest of the night and I still am now and basically I m trying to avoid his affections and urghhhhh why does everything have to be so difficult Why can t I just be cool with this He s weird with his phone and I know that it s really just because he basically has zero social skills and also he s been looking at stuff for my birthday but he has so many more Facebook friends than me and back when we first got together he told me he basically just added girls he didn t know if he thought they were hot and I can t help but feel paranoid that he s in touch with them or whatever I use my exes to try to offset this like I wouldn t even be FB friends with any of them if it wasn t for his stuff with the girls I like to feel like I have leverage too just so it feels even but ugh Anyone else been through this have any tips TL DR Boyfriend was a douche when we got together constantly talked about exes This added to my existing paranoia and jealousy and two years on even though he s nice now I m still paranoid when I see them on Facebook he s a bit cagey with his phone How to deal,Emotional Distress
Hi all These days I m looking for a career Any career really I want to be a normal adult or at least look like one I m afraid that if I don t establish a career I ll be accused of incompetence or worse laziness by my partner and or partner s family Bad bad bad I have a problem though in addition to BPD I ve got major social problems It s bad enough that I ve diagnosed with Aspergers in the past My current psych says I was most likely PDD to some degree in childhood regardless of my current predicament So in short I m socially inept i e poor eye contact mind blindness and incredibly emotionally turbulent Not a good mix That being said has anyone found a job under similar conditions Note I m really really bad at math Love X,Emotional Distress
I m going to lose my best friend and its been eating at me today I think its my fault too His name is Jon and we ve been really good friends for almost a year now Its so easy talking to him because at times I feel like he s the only one that listens At the end of spring I was hospitalized for anxiety and depression and was diagnosed with BPD Ever since then he s developed really strong feelings for me but the feeling was never mutual I m not attracted to him All throughout summer he asked me to be his girlfriend and I ve rejected him It wasn t obvious to him because I tried to let him down lightly My rejections each and every time were mistaken as maybes Its my fault because I ve developed a drinking problem this summer And to make matters worse I was also taking lorazepam three times a day so each time I drank I ended up blacking out Apparently I m a drunk flirt and when socially drinking no one realizes when I black out That s where I lead him on without realizing it I would flirt with him when I was black out And then the next day I would continue being his friend without realizing what I had done the night before Last week he told me that he was going to ask me if I wanted to be his girlfriend for the last time and he wanted a clear answer I said no Then I feel like the conversation drifted into him manipulating me to admit I was a tease Not only that but that I was a tease to other guys too And that s when the guilt and shame kicked in I felt like I was really mean to him and apologized for my actions which he totally deserved I also told him that I never saw myself dating anyone The next day I thought I was going to lose him as a friend someone I could confide in I gave up drinking and taking my lorazepam because its not worth it Taking both was possibly the dumbest decisions I have ever made All I could think about that day was him leaving our friendship Suddenly I felt very lonely I started to wonder if I really did have more feelings for him and if I really should give him a chance I invited him over later that night impulsively asking him to be my boyfriend He was so excited and was ready to tell all our friends It was fine at first but later in the night when it was close to saying our goodbyes I realized I didn t want to even touch him I could not see myself being romantically involved with him I felt like I only asked him to be my boyfriend because I was upset about getting called a tease and I had to prove that I wasn t Its almost been a week and he s been on vacation with his dad I plan on breaking it off when he gets back I figure I should let him know my feelings as soon as possible It wouldn t be fair to him if I dragged it on To say the least I tried It just doesn t work out in my head I regret acting on my impulses and not giving the idea time to come to a conclusion I m going to tell him that I asked him because I felt guilty for leading him on and thought that he deserved a chance I just don t see us together Besides I really don t need a relationship right now I need to focus on myself and therapy making good changes in my behavior I also think its a good idea that we need time away from each other I am fully prepared to lose him as a best friend He deserves to be away from me I play the victim often and don t realize when I m victimizing other people s emotions I think I have learned a lesson from all of this I am not always the protagonist very often I am the antagonist I lacked empathy for Jon s emotions,Emotional Distress
Hey all first time actually posting my own thread so please bear with if the formatting is terrible or anything like that The title is a tl dr of a situation I currently find myself in and I would appreciate some thoughts or insight if anyone has anything to share or if they have experienced anything similar I cut contact with someone today and effectively removed them from my life altogether as much as possible anyway A lot of friends and family were telling me to remove this person as she was making me worse in a lot of ways and looking back on how things were and how she treated me I can see their point but at the time I was reluctant due to a number of reasons mainly because I was struggling with splitting she can treat me like shit for 95 of the time and make me feel miserable but the 5 she doesn t she s suddenly the only one for me and all is forgotten forgiven as well as the simple fact that I loved her and just general anxiety guilt issues I had a love hate relationship with her for years and we had history but she recently came out of a long term relationship and we ended up hooking up although I think it was just a rebound type thing more than anything else in hindsight This brought old feelings to the surface and I made them clear to her she said it was reciprocated but she needed time because of her breakup which I understood of course She said that she definitely wanted us to be a thing though and that she had loved me for a long time For a time everything was mutual I even bought her a promise ring clich I know to symbolise my feelings for her Months passed I brought up the possibility of a relationship occasionally but she said she still needed time all the while she started talking to and meeting up with guys on dating sites regularly I got depressed about it because I felt she wasn t being upfront with me whenever I spoke to her about it she just dodged the topic completely and acted like nothing was going on but then proceeded to post about her dating all over social media as well as bemoaning her love life or apparent lack thereof I didn t really know where I stood with her as she was adamant she loved me and wanted to be with me but would then see other guys My friendship relationship whatever it was deteriorated and became very one sided she only really made any effort when it was beneficial to her and usually only attempted to talk to me when she wanted something or when it was very late at night which I assume was because all her current suitors had gone to sleep at this point and I was the last port of call for some attention If I didn t respond to her messages instantaneously she would fly off the handle or guilt trip me with sarcastic messages like Done ignoring me yet or Let me know when you feel like talking to me again and I started to feel trapped I didn t want to talk to her because she was treating me like this but then if I didn t it would only escalate I was basically just a source of late night attention and a free Netflix account to her at this point and we barely spoke I was miserable but ultimately made the decision that I had to just cut my losses and try and move on as things clearly weren t working and my mental health suffered as a result That being said I now feel a huge sense of guilt I didn t tell her I needed to cut contact or try and explain myself because I knew that she wouldn t take it well so I did it without warning but I now feel like a terrible person for not saying anything about it prior I feel personally that it was justified and ultimately the right thing to do for my own well being but still Any insight or thoughts would be appreciated tl dr Cut contact with someone that ultimately was making me worse now feel guilty for removing them from my life,Emotional Distress

A little back info 22 Male I tend to chameleon and copy others as a lot of BPD sufferers do and in this case it happens to be a fictional character The Doctor specifically I ve only recently began watching Doctor Who but I already feel the obsession coming as it becomes the new thing from which I define my sense of identity I haven t even watched a significant portion of the show yet and I already am obsessed not so much with the show as much as The Doctor as a man He seems like an almost living personification of BPD The constantly switching identity for him literally the mostly lonely life interjected with short relationships with friends companions observing the world and life from afar rather than being of it I get him on a more personal level than anyone I ve ever met in reality Part of me holds a small amount of faith that The Doctor is real out there somewhere And honestly that faith is stronger than any faith I might have in a god I ve already started copying the manic behaviors of Matt Smith and David Tenant So I ask what exactly should I do in this situation Feeling identity even if it s based on some British sci fi series feels amazing Acting like The Doctor feels right its been keeping my depression at bay But I know it s probably not healthy TL DR Can I ride a sudden Doctor Who obsession to sanity,Emotional Distress
tl dr possible BPD in a messy relationship surprise trying to recognise which fears are real and which ones are amplified out of control don t know how to communicate to my partner that some of my fears are legitimate things that need to be taken seriously outside of any possible mental illness other questions is it possible to repair a relationship that s been damaged by BPD type behavior how can i minimize this behavior in the future and how can he trust that things are improving ______________ a little background i 28 f have not been formally diagnosed but my partner believes i have tendencies related to BPD and or bipolar 2 he s currently reading stop walking on eggshells and says there s many parallels between our relationship and a typical BPD one after reading a bit about these there s certainly some similarities and some issues i need to address i ve just started seeing a therapist and she s warned me to be very wary of these pop psychology books and self diagnosis and that it s better to start out dealing with problems as they are rather than as part of a named framework i tend to agree with her but feel that there s still benefit in reaching out to people with similar problems and personality traits so here i am we d been dating for about 9 months and he was dealing with my mood swings and hostility by withdrawing and just waiting for the soft warm part of me to come back meanwhile i was basically oblivious to this sometimes after coming back from a hostile streak i would realise what i d done but never really undertstood the full pattern or how painful i was making things for him we decided to go long distance for 4 months when things got particularly rocky with the agreement that he would come to join me in my home city and we would build a life there shortly after i left he cheated on me several times and lied about it the truth finally came out and i broke down i honestly felt like the pain could kill me at times it was so intense not so much the infidelity itself but the lying and humiliation of it all i m still trying to deal with this i finally saw the part i played in his unhappiness and how my behavior over the course of the relationship had damaged him deeply enough to do this to me we agreed to give this another shot with full honesty and my understanding of how my actions hurt him however it s also come out that at the time we decided to go long distance he didn t actually have a whole lot of faith in things working out i feel so silly that i truly believed him when he said things would be fine between us this last month has been pure hell we ve fought and cried and several times he s decided he s had enough and left me i always beg and plead for him to come back and try again and this is where we re at right now i really want to rebuild things as i think we have a lot of potential to be wonderful partners to each other but i can t separate what are BPD style thoughts and what are legitimate ones for example i feel sure that he s going to leave me again that as soon as things are rough he ll behave as he has done for the last month but not for the 9 months leading up to this this looks like a typical BPD fear of abandonment but wouldn t a perfectly normal person feel the same way how do i recognise which fears are worth paying attention to and how do i communicate this to him if he s doing something objectively hurtful or mean how do i express that without seeming like it s just my crazy brain i have a meeting with my therapist tomorrow and will be bringing all of this up any help or stories from here would be much appreciated,Emotional Distress
I am really tired of hearing seeing people talk about their undiagnosed BPD SO or family members There is no such thing as undiagnosed BPD You either have it or you don t and only a medical professional can determine if your loved one has it It took years of hospitalizations meltdowns therapy and being a medication guinea pig before I was gifted this wonderful diagnosis by a medical professional did I mention how important that part is That s all we need is more stigma right guys Every psycho out there must have undiagnosed BPD It is really hard for me to consider anyone a BPD loved one when their spouse is neither diagnosed BPD and they themselves are clearly not loved ones I feel like it is the psychological equivalent to assuming your relative has diabetes based on symptoms you read online shutting out all other possibilities and then putting them on a diet while providing insulin shots because you are too narrow minded to simply bring them to a doctor to figure out the real reason they are peeing 20 times a day It is damaging to make assumptions about someone s health and seek treatment based on that assumption whether it be mental or physical Back before I was diagnosed I had to have brain scans to make absolutely sure that my symptoms weren t being caused by some sort of physical ailment which was a very real possibility and still is for these undiagnosed BPD or so their loved ones call them I am tired of it I hate the stigma which seems to be growing more and more with every loved one that wants to put the BPD label on someone they care about They don t do it for the one with undiagnosed BPD they do it for themselves because it is so much easier to just place a shitty person in the BPD box and then treat them as such Everything is easier to deal with when it s in a neat little box It makes the rest of us look bad not that we look very good to begin with If I weren t typing right now my fingers would be aching from making finger quotes And this is not the subreddit that I really think needs to see this Rant over,Emotional Distress
I m 20 years old I ve been to roughly one funeral per year of my life most of them coming from 8 years old on And now I gotta go to another one this time it s my 45 year old mom s best friend who helped raise me and my siblings She was always there for us She was the happiest person I ve ever met Until my mom and she had a falling out last year over a child services case where my father and sister ganged up on my mom and my kid brother and the friend believed my manipulative narcissistic father and sister my mom and her were the closest of friends And she dropped dead of a heart attack I came home today from a nice workout My brother despite all the shit our almost deadbeat fully abusive father did still went on vacation with him It was good for him to get out of the city My mom was standing with a cigarette in her mouth and a cold look on her face I assumed my very elderly grandma had passed She said worse I immediately thought of my brother Nope My honorary aunt was dead leaving behind three young kids and a husband My mom collapsed on the floor crying her eyes out and saying that her cop friend is coming over to keep her from ODing on anxiety pills I don t feel sad I don t feel like I m going to cry I feel nothing This is generally how I feel when someone dies It s less of a why and more of a Well damn In the past year alone I ve lost a very close friend suddenly as well as two friends to cancer It seems that every person I care about leaves me in some form or another whether it s their choice or not No wonder I have abandonment issues I don t give a fuck that she took my father and sister s side in the child services case She was misled She wanted the best for my mom and us No matter what she was still my aunt I m so used to losing people that it is making me feel empty I can t feel anything at someone dying anymore which is really weird considering how emotional I can be at every thing else Im the rational one when people pass My mom just went out and I m worried she won t come back My mom was so angry at her for the whole child services fiasco all of it was brought on by fabricated lies from the narcissists I call my father and sister that she never forgave her She felt that she abandoned her And now my aunt is gone forever and I m seriously worried my mom might do something stupid I m sorry for the rant This is just one more person that I lost and I m not sure how much more I can take losing people before I lose my feelings completely and be empty 24 7,Emotional Distress

I m in a real relationship for the first time in many years and for the first time since my diagnosis I m struggling somewhat with feelings of rejection why hasn t he texted me back immediately and general clinginess and idealisation etc etc you get the idea He knows of my diagnosis but I don t know how much he knows about it I haven t said much I don t know if he s looked anything up I wanted to help myself calm down a bit and be more normal because my own emotions are distressing me so I decided to google BPD and romantic relationships Lol Don t do that unless you want to have a bad time Just a long list of advice for people trying to cope with BPD partners and how horrible we can be as SOs I just really hope my boyfriend hasn t googled the same thing No real point here just a rant really Thanks for reading if you did,Emotional Distress
And it was alright I guess Well actually I had a terrible time but I m truly grateful for the friends that were there and cared enough to make sure I had a good time But these two girls I go to school with I invited them out a week in advance and not only did they not show up they didn t answer my text when I asked if they were coming and they went ahead and posted a snapchat story of them together at some other bar They didn t even bother to come by and say hi and neither of them bothered to wish me a happy birthday I ve been friends with these girls for the past two years Obviously I m really hurt by this I don t really understand what I did or why they would be so cruel But I also haven t really reacted to it at all I m not sure how to react In fact I feel like I m trying to convince myself that it didn t happen or that it was no big deal and that would be fine if I didn t have to see them again in September I have no idea what to do or what to say when I see them and I m so worried I m going to lash out at them in front of others or have myself a nice day long anxiety attack the day before classes start again and shut down completely when I see them I just don t want to react to this like I would in middle school which was to fully shut down and shut everyone out To basically dissociate from myself But I don t know what else to do and I can t see my therapist who has helped me SO much to even get to the point of where I am now before then,Emotional Distress

I don t think I need to give a whole back story but I ll give you a little I just want advice on how to educate an non BPD SO on BPD My SO shows no interest in my disorder and we try to ignore forget about it Ä I feel like as much as I explain it there are only a few facts that are understood by my SO that I been with for years I get upset easily I have strong emotions overall sudden anger is common I lack control of my emotions and when I m upset it really really frickin hurts It is all things that can be observed and me saying it really hurts a billion times when I m having an episode I don t want to say my SO doesn t care but I know they never researched anything and tries to forget I have an illness We never talk about it and they don t have the best awareness of mental health in general I don t to give them 20 articles that they probably would never get to and would overwhelm them Also I don t want them to think I have ALL the issues listed We all plus or minus some symptoms Sometimes I think I m better off with someone who would do all this research on their own to really try to understand me and to ask questions on how they can help That is selfish though he is always there when I m freaking out and understanding BPD is very difficult My SO kinda lets me do my own thing and is there to comfort me physically but silently Just waiting there for me to pick up the pieces on my own to then tell them ÄúI m okay Äù and go back to normal and act like nothing happened I usually end up saying sorry since I feel like a burden and it isn t Äúnormal Äù to freak out like how I do I have a hard time explaining BPD personally to my SO since I m not even sure what Äúnormal Äù is suppose to be at this point I want it to be understood that I really am sick It cannot excuse all my actions but something isn t right with me and BPD is the cause That is why my SO has seen me in such ridiculous Äùinappropriate Äù pain and expression of emotion I often wonder if they think it is because I m a girl and it is not related to my mental health It might be important to note that I have been with my SO since before I was diagnosed with BPD I always labeled myself an emotional person When diagnosed it all clicked but it didn t for my SO Maybe understanding my dark side is bad for their mental health and I should just keep things the way they are My SO is really is pained when I m upset but they seems to freeze up One time I did ask why they froze up and is always silent I learned they were scared they would make it worse since I usually act aggressively when I m upset I push away yet I want to be held so tightly Anyone have any success stories getting someone to understand and help with BPD I read so many nice articles on how to have healthy relationships with BPD and how to be supportive and I wish I wasn t the only one reading them Ä Also seems odd for me to list things they Äúshould do Äù I feel embarrassed even speaking about it as if it is a taboo subject for us,Emotional Distress

I m not even a real person anymore I don t have thoughts or feelings when I m all by myself and that blankness only deepens when I m around anyone else I m either too anxious to fucking breathe or dissociating heavily and trying to hurt everyone around me when the real me has disappeared I don t want people to look or talk to me because they ll only trigger my insane fucking BPD ass thoughts and make me feel horrible for their mistake It s a shame I can t put those cluttered thoughts towards something interesting or useful like an actual friendship or hobby I wish I could be sane I wish I could be normal and loved and happy but that just isn t in the cards for me It ll never be I ll always be just sitting in my bed watching TV and movies about people having friendships and relationships and wishing I deserved any of that Maybe if I wasn t fucking molested by someone I had to live with for 17 years Maybe if my parents weren t extremely neglectful Maybe if I didn t have BPD I don t know I can t really see myself living past 18 or really past this week What s the point,Suicidal Reference
If Hell is real I m definitely going to it So is 95 of the human race Good people go to hell I have suicide in the back of my mind as a permanent Plan B a way to escape when inevitably for me everything goes wrong But if hell and heaven come to think of it is eternal there is no escape Ever And that really hits me sometimes,Suicidal Reference
I m 27 she s 24 and we ve been married for 3 years She s been married before and has a kid with me and her last husband It s been a tough 3 years and I feel like there s a lot at stake When she was 3 months pregnant and trying to start a family with me she was sexting 6 other guys That was a major shock but I couldn t walk away from a family because of feeling a strong sense of conviction Then 2 days ago the incident at the motel happened She said that she was so embarrassed and ashamed of what happened that she was ready to die The day I left her mom caught her trying to cut herself and immediately got her to a hospital The last time she cut herself was 10yrs ago Can somebody please tell me what to expect if I stay with her for the rest of my life She said she wants help now,Suicidal Reference
It s 2am I just want to sleep but I m terrified Even when I know I m being irrational I can t stop Just after my boyfriend said he was upset I don t trust him and get mad at him for going to sleep and not messaging me etc I do exactly those things I have sent him so many messages Long messages Paragraphs Now I am so scared he will wake up and read them and realise he can t be with me or that I m too much or that I m not worth it He knows I love him and he said he will love me forever I think it s just something he needs to sleep off tonight but I m still petrified I don t want him to go If he goes I will die,Suicidal Reference
My wife has been diagnosed with BPD recently but has been suffering for 10 years She is currently in a High Care area of an inpatient Mental Health Facility For the past 48 hours she has been in a cycle of Trying to commit suicide Being Restrained Being doped up Locked in padded room until she calms down enough that they release her Back to trying to kill herself within an hour The doctors continue to do the same thing and I am wondering what can be done whilst she is in this cycle to try and stop it Is there anything I can do Is there anything the doctor should be doing that I can check on Asking here because some people here may have been in the same situation and would know what to do ask,Suicidal Reference

TL DR at end When I left my ex husband after six years it was because I knew the only other way the relationship would end was by one of us dying either by homicide or suicide I was sleeping on the couch at the end of the six years and one day I woke up early and left the house before he woke up and never went home He went absolutely full on stalker crazy smear campaign against me to everyone I knew and his entire family He drove to my parents house where I was staying and downed two bottles of pills in the driveway in his car I called an ambulance and he was taken away while my daughter was watching in the window she was four When I went to the hospital for ten minutes he said I m so glad you re here to take care of me I said I m still leaving This doesn t change anything His friend pulled me aside and said My dad did the same thing to my mom but he actually did die Don t go back to him From that moment on I have been 100 pure robotic toward him when we are forced to interact This was all seven years ago Now I am remarried as functional as a borderline in recovery can be although I have a lot of bad emotional days still while grieving a lot from the past and cutting off the people in my family who are abusive So he was dropping off my daughter after spending the afternoon with her this past weekend I had been sipping drinks on the lawn with my husband and enjoying the nice weather In a flash I decided Maybe I can show my daughter that her parents don t hate each other So I offered him a beer We caught up on a few things his uncle got divorced his friend had another baby etc Only things about him Of course While he was talking my husband had this look of disgust on his face toward him He noticed and then promptly left It wasn t intentional but I think my husband is just protective of me Now I guess what I m wondering I mean it was so long ago I ve blocked out so much of it Was it abuse I endured or a tumultuous bpd relationship Things like him calling me on repeat 60 70 times when I was out with a friend or making me wear my cell phone and answer it after one ring at all hours of the day and night not allowing me to use the shared car to go buy diapers because it was wasting gas throwing things at the wall near my head to terrorize me breaking the computer monitor taking money intended for car insurance and instead of paying it letting it lapse and then buying music equipment for a band he was in with teenagers he was 26 holding my arms and pushing me against a wall me waking up in the middle of him raping me not letting me buy clothes or makeup but forcing me to wear his hand me downs and just look like shit the cops were called on several occasions due to screaming etc etc There was never any punching or slapping Just name calling terrorizing threatening screaming and extreme financial and physical control and always needing to keep tabs on my whereabouts emails passwords and reading my phone I am just not sure did I provoke this I don t remember how these fights escalated We went to couples therapy twice I was on medication once then he was diagnosed bipolar and medicated nothing seemed to help and that s why I left because it got so bad I couldn t sleep next to him for fear of him suffocating me in my sleep So seven years later I offered him a beer Tonight I watched an HBO documentary about domestic violence and I thought wow this really resonates with me And now I am feeling very anxious and dirty like I need to shower or go back to just forgetting like it never happened Being robotic toward him I don t think I want him around my daughter at all TL DR I am not sure about my past if it was abuse and domestic violence or was it me being borderline and driving someone crazy,Suicidal Reference
I m sitting here watching the hockey game and going on Tinder I just got back from college so I m new in the town I have been using it for four days and got exactly no matches And then I saw an especially beautiful woman who had a lot of common interests and once again no match So I closed the app and immediately thought Well I should kill myself How should I do it I m unattractive and I m not gonna get any all summer what s the point of living So I started thinking which of the knifes in the kitchen would be better if I want to cut my neck open or stab myself or how many pills are in the cabinet and if there would still be some left over if anyone needed some And then I saw the shitty miscall in the game that was BLATANT goalie interference and kinda pushed it aside And this is normal This is a daily thing One thing goes wrong and suicide is the first thought Hell even seeing an opportunity to kill myself has me thinking if I should just do it I m just wondering how healthy people do it Fuck it I m insane at this point how do sane people do it It s just so foreign How people can just live and know that they will and want to live and don t give it a second thought That s what seems insane to me,Suicidal Reference
I texted her around 9 So I ve been dating this girl for like a month And I ve been taking it purposely slow Like I ll only text her when asking to meet up and while I see her much more frequently I rarely text her Texting was my downfall in my last relationship We texted every day whether we saw each other already or not I developed a few too many tendencies that were bad If she didn t text back I d immediately go to the local news and see if there was a car crash or some other accident I would check google to see if something happened I d text bomb her 10 times Eventually combined with other aspects of my emotional roller coaster personality and the fact that I m an overwhelming person she broke up with me for her own sanity Now I ve been holding up this facade for a month now That I m somehow okay I m normal All this bullshit I ve been avoiding situations that trigger these behaviors Hell I went from starting cutting before I met her to stopping since I ve been dating her And while it still calls to me it isn t as strong now But still I m getting the urge to google to turn on the news to text bomb her 10 times All of that bullshit I m getting really antsy Now I m listening to some music trying to calm down and deciding whether I want to take my meds right now instead of in an hour just so I can temporarily put myself out of this misery I always fear that they are leaving me That they stopped caring That they don t give a shit And while to me those all seem likely to anyone I try to talk to that doesn t understand the way I feel I sound crazy In all likelihood she either fell asleep or is too busy at the moment to check her phone Or she mentally replied but didn t actually reply Holy shit this is frustrating Our last conversation on Sunday an actual conversation not just the set up next meet up text was great And of course my mind is working against me Fuck my mind Evil Brain Does anyone have any advice on how to fight these stupid urges and avoid collapse on what I ve been trying hard to work on,Suicidal Reference
Does anyone get extremely angry with if you feel like you re going to do something rash call 911 What in the hell is the 911 respondent really going to do for me So I talk So I get an ambulance So I m hospitalized So x days later I m released And ta dah there s the same catastrophic emotions waiting eagerly to devour Most importantly am I surprised by this No So back to the phone call BPD can be misery There s a true reality that one day I may kilo myself And it will be when the level of suffering exceeds what I can endure Part of this is time If I lived long enough battling this and continue to suffer well Why continue anymore And at such a point there is no calling 911 I know if I reach that point then there s nothing left I m sorry This is a meaningless rant There s a lot of emotion raging inside of me right now,Suicidal Reference
I don t know if this is okay to post here I m new to this sub I m also new to bpd I haven t been officially diagnosed but it was brought up by one of my first therapists a few years ago and swept under the rug because I wasn t honest about my impulsivity amp destructive tendencies But last night I had a really intense anxiety mood swing panic attack dissociative episode and I ended up self harming for the first time in 3 years I m just feeling really lost and confused right now and don t know who to talk to I had a fight with my SO last night I m also chronically ill and the last six months have been hellish I don t want to go into too much detail but our relationship has been strained already and every little argument makes me feel like I m two minutes away from losing the love of my life We had really great sex last night and then almost immediately afterwards I started feeling really anxious and insecure and I started thinking about babies Which was bizarre anyway but I m not ready to have kids and won t be for a very long time if ever I don t even know if I can carry a pregnancy to term bc of my illnesses But I started becoming obsessed about the thought of having a kid with my SO and I even asked him if he wanted to have a kid one day even though I knew his answer we ve talked about this before we moved in together He said no probably not again which I knew but it caused me to go into this crazy dissociative state I had a panic attack I cut myself after 3 years clean and didn t even realize what I had done until he came into the room and stopped me I just felt so out of control last night and so insane And now I feel guilty for keeping my SO awake last night he only got 3 hours of sleep before work and ashamed that not only did I cut again but that he saw it too I really just need to talk to him but he s still at work I don t really feel safe being home alone for 5 more hours I m scared that I ll dissociate like that again I m calling my therapist second one this year I have such a hard time finding someone I feel comfortable talking to to see if I can get in sooner rather than later,Suicidal Reference
It has been almost five years since I slept next to her but it only takes a millisecond for me to close my eyes and travel back in time As a future therapist I find it extremely troubling that I can t even solve my own shit Ever since I can remember people were coming to me for advice about all kinds of issues but I ve never had good insight into things going on in my life Long story short I have SERIOUS abandonment issues and my first wife was my mother goddess She was the first real person I ever latched onto and I ve had a lot of difficulty letting go We have two children together which exasperates things I always feel like I could find some sort of solace if I stopped talking to her entirely but that s not really possible I hate that all or nothing feeling My stomach twists and my chest tightens every time I have to pick the kids up All things considered I do a pretty excellent job of staying cool in front of our children even though I feel like I am dying on the inside She remarried almost instantly after our divorce which hurt pretty bad We had a loose agreement to not have any more children because we agreed that it would add stress to an already tense situation for the kids Well her third child just turned one and the last year has been a roller coaster I found someone who I am not crazy about but she keeps me sane Less than a month before our wedding my ex decided to drop a bunch of shit on me I could write a novel about all of those conversations but the gist is that she holds the belief that I am her Äúsoul mate Äô but things just didn Äôt work out What kills me I remember one specific day when things started falling apart Standing in the middle of a parking lot I told her Äúyou Äôre my soul mate I don Äôt want to be with anyone else Äù and she scoffed I Äôve had serious thoughts about killing myself Every time I start to put plans into action my son or daughter will do something to remind me of why I Äôm here I know that most people will respond to this and say Äúyou have to be alive for your children Äù but it Äôs common for borderline patients to latch onto their kids I think that my mom has a tinge of borderline and she Äôs always been a huge burden to me I have a severe anxiety that I will pass this garbage onto my children I stopped cutting about 10 years ago but have started other self harming behavior like punching myself in the face etc I want to get over this so badly but everything I Äôve tried has failed I Äôve been in pretty constant therapy but I feel like I Äôm in revolving crisis management Hating her doesn Äôt work because my poker face is pretty shit Ignoring stopping my thoughts just makes them come out in strange ways think sleepwalking talking nightmares etc Cognitive restructuring has helped a bit but I don Äôt always have the time to break down every negative thought or feeling that comes into my head How the fuck do you get over someone without totally splitting them I feel like I Äôm going to lose my shit if I can Äôt figure this out,Suicidal Reference

Is it okay I feel like I want to stay in psychodynamic therapy at one place but the therapy is not helping with my day to day self destructive symptoms I feel like I need to use any tools I can to maintain my health My psychodynamic therapist is not giving me straight answers either way and it s frustrating I ve been there for one and a half years It s annoying because I know that I have to go for the long haul re BPD and psychodynamic psychoanalysis can take a while But what the hell am I supposed to do in the mean time I could accidentally self harm to death during this period I think that DBT can help me more with the damage control side of things Is this a good idea,Suicidal Reference

Hey BPD I ve messed up pretty badly with my SO We ve always talked about opening up the relationship some Well a friend of mine has fallen for him I ve been so afraid he would cheat on me with her and used to being ignored that I told him to go ahead and sleep with her if he wants to Of course he reasonably told her this and things have been gradually escalating between them Ive been telling him I ve been okay with it we re gonna move tomorrow and realistically never see her again plus I never thought anything would happen but finally last night I asked him to not hang out with her before we left He was very surprised at my request and admitted they already had plans I totally blew up at him telling him I m angry at both of them how could he do this to me what does he even see in me blah blah blah Of course this totally blindsided him Well he s been kind enough to compromise they are going to hang out but he said he ll keep it platonic and even hang out outside the house to deter anything physical from happening My questions are how do I stifle the voice in my head that says he s totally going to dump her for me even though I know this isn t going to happen how do I tell the voice that feels so guilty about putting him through this that I should kill myself to shut up and how do I learn to validate my own feelings tell him this weirds me out before things get terrible We are working on our communication already this just made me realize I don t communicate because I don t trust my feelings I also needed to get this off my chest Thank BPD,Suicidal Reference
ive had this feeling since forever since i was really little but back then i didnt have friends crappy parenting and constantly moving moving moving so it wasnt as bad but now that my bpd has developed as ive gotten older ive developed attachments to people like idealizing them a lot like all my decisions and actions and feelings in life are related somewhat to that person anyway i go to school far away from where my family lives and im graduating soon in a semester im so scared because i want to stay around my college town to be near my idealized friends my whole world revolves around them because i never ever had many friends at all i literally only have 4 with 1 being idealized the most but i cant stay near my college town because every second of every day i feel anxiety and emptiness because i dont belong there im like an impostor im not from that city or that state hell the country for that matter i dont belong there living there just seems temporary because its not my place but if i move back to my parents city where i went to high school it would be like regressing to being a kid because my parents are very like the type of close parenting that never lets you leave the nest and causes bpd ive already promised myself for many years that if i go back to my parents city i will just get a job a crappy apartment live alone thousands of miles away from my idealized friends and shoot myself in the head im so confused and so sad im very suicidal to begin with but sometimes i have times of clarity where i want to plan the rest of my life out but this huge feeling of not belonging and being an impostor EVERYWHERE is keeping me from making plans and makes me more suicidal in fact what i see that i wont feel at home anywhere i just tell myself its fine just live somewhere and if you dont like it after a few months you can kill yourself because i dont see anything else i can do,Suicidal Reference
Does anyone else get completely drained after being extremely happy positive I ve been doing well I felt almost recovered I ve made it 8 months sober 6 months without self harming and starting to feel ok living on my own Then tonight the best thing all year has finally happened my favorite hockey team won the Stanley Cup It was a lovely celebration Lots of tears lots of hugs just a beautiful time with my friends Though once I got into my car to go home everything drained out of me I am almost catatonic I want to self harm drink anything to hurt me and I m so disappointed in myself Im not going to lose what I ve accomplished so far but I guess I just need reassurance Does this happen to anyone else after extreme euphoria,Suicidal Reference
So I ve been diagnosed for 4 years currently being treated with medication while I wait for CBT I ve started noticing lately whenever I get so anxious or stressed for any reason Most frequently anything that reminds me of my ex that I seem to It s pretty hard to explain And when I say anxious I mean extremely To the point where I d rather die than feel this way I suffer from GAD but this is when it hits the max It s like I m on autopilot my body is in control I stop talking and start feeling Nothing It s a weird sensation like my brain is just along for the ride in my body I stop feeling anything and just stare into space I told my psychiatrist and explained all of that but he never confirmed or denied that it is indeed Depersonalization Hoping anyone can shed some insight,Suicidal Reference
Although I ve been in therapy for almost 7 years I just managed to massage a diagnosis out of my therapist She didn t want to give me one because she wanted to protect me from the stigma She was right but I forced it out of her anyway Now I m fucked Stuck with this BPD shit I mean how would I ever tell my future SO He would just leave me immediately I know I would get the fuck out as all those beautifully nonfuckedup people suggest all over the interwebs Not that I have a SO I ve been single for over 5 years No surprises there I m a horrible person No empathy The harder I try the uglier I become Almost always turn into a bunny boiler by the end Hating is what I do best I have sooo much baggage even without BPD it s almost impossible for anyone to relate and accept An ex stripper with innumerable sexual partners drinking drugs violence dysfunctional relationships and a spectacularly failed career The world would be a better place without me and the only things I m good at is hating and suffering anyway I wish I was never born,Suicidal Reference

I seek perspective from people with BPD Perhaps not so much a diagnosis but just the foundations of our relationship My girlfriend is witty perceptive intelligent empathetic and ambitious Her bubbly personality is what drew me to her and I am in love with her She fell in love with me very quickly and I with her Her parents divorced and she has told me her cousin touched her when she was younger but doesn t remember much of it and almost defends him Perhaps linked she often likes to talk in a baby tone and it almost feels like regression especially when she wants something Early on in our relationship she went to Europe and I discerned that she had kissed another guy over there I felt horrible Before she finally admitted it she was the one that made herself out to the victim and made me feel paranoid We took a break but we got back together after much discussion and begging on her behalf under the condition if anything remotely happens like that again we are over While my codependent side feels I would go back to her I know I deserve better Since this happened I have been trying to regain my trust in her and it has been difficult Whenever I have had a paranoid theory or thought or felt jealous I tried to be rational about it and prefix with I feel lt x gt rather than outright accusations Meditation has helped with this She has been more than understanding and provides evidence and has helped A few nights ago I said something thoughtless and insensitive which really hurt her and she reacted with an attack that she knew would be designed to hurt me and share the pain She immediately regretted this but it did feel like a step back in trusting her with intimate and vulnerable details about myself We were talking last night and she said she hasn t felt pretty since Europe This alarmed me somewhat and I asked why and she said it was because she has been studying and has has seldom time for a social life I prefaced that I wouldn t be offended and asked is it because she is lacking guys attention Yes guys attention 100 she responded I was actually offended and became very passive aggressive and was like Okay thought so You said you were tired Have a good sleep and she sensed I was offended and tried reassuring me I was the only attention she needed She then tried to elaborate it wasn t just guys attention but more so social in general but I got the sense she was saying these things in order to hide away the truth she still loves the validation from guys I was still passive aggressive and after another apology from her she left and said fine I sent her a big letter and said I understand completely that she wants attention that s normal but there s a boundary issue I also expressed my feelings that she is equating her studies with a lack of attention from guys as opposed to being committed with me She responded the next morning while I was sleeping with what seems to be maladaptive behaviour being the victim She did this before the Europe affair came ahead too I need to study and I don t want to feel like I ve hurt you You re making me suffer I feel like my heart is being taken out of my chest and you ve broken up with me Please say you love me and saying she is missing her classes because of this intense fear of abandonment I felt sorry for her but at the same time I felt she was more concerned with how she was feeling heartache abandonment etc as opposed to how that made me feel though she did apologise and try to explain what she meant 100 as in she 100 agrees rather than it being exclusively male attention she knows she can t receive that kind of attention while committed and she is genuinely sorry for upsetting me I ve been researching this for some months and I used to think I had narcissistic tendencies But what if it s comobordity I ve been thinking more and more and it seems not only she may have BPD but I as well Did I overract to her admitting some of it is guy attention and I passive aggressively manipulated into her conceding fault and wanting me back My mother was a very emotional person having gone to a mental hospital in the 20 s for extreme mood swings and paranoid tendencies She also fell in love with her psychologist My mother and father would often get in drunk fights she would abuse him verbally and make him feel bad and he would ultimately lash out in narcissistic rage My mother would the confide in me from the age of 9 and I got this feeling of being the helper I have this feeling of being the helper for my current girlfriend My mother passed away at the age of 12 She was my best friend and confidant I have a lot of social anxiety and misinterpret words in a negative sense against me and also see neutral faces as something more sinister or judgmental Even though I lost weight years ago my self esteem and body image issues are persistent I sometimes think I am overweight and other times very attractive As did my mother My mother made me out to be the most perfect child in the world I have never cut myself but I had some suicidal ideation in 2013 I seem to be hypersexual and impulsive The idea of cheating on her actually turns me on but I know I would NEVER act on it I seem hypocrtical to say she needs to love herself but the idea of more attention from girls would also boost my self esteem I feel a different subtle sense of self around different people Like if I imagine there presence now my internal face feels a bit different Or my perception of my voice This is why I often have a fear of Worlds Colliding in the style of George Costanza I never let anyone in until her I am 23 years old I had an intense fear of abandonment and rejection I let her in and I often like it when she is chasing after me but then I feel I need her and she pulls away and so the push pull cycle goes I am a perfectionist and very sensitive During my teenage years I used to fantasise that my life was actually a book written by someone else and I was merely in a story It was a nice escape I fall in love very easily The littlest thing about someone makes me think they are a genuinely terrible person and I attribute a weakness as indicative of their overall character For example when she lashed out at me I saw her as someone completely malicious and out to get me I assumed she was out to hurt me when I am still very jealous and paranoid and often want to check her social media I often check her snapchat score to see if it goes up dramatically independent of me I like that she doesn t go out I also get paranoid if I see her online Facebook and isn t messaging me or there is a significant lag in conversation response times What else would she be doing I think this is exaggerated because my paranoid fears once came true but I think they still would exist if they did not I feel a part of me knew that being passive aggressive would hurt her so she would feel the pain I felt I don t want to play games I don t want

ever since I was little the most random things would immediately make like this intense sadness and emptiness come over me i remember when i was 10 years old I would look at the sunset i mean this still happens all the time and immediately something would change in me and i would feel so suicidal my feelings felt kind of jumbled because it was so intense the only reason i could make out for feeling sad from that whole jumble was something about how the sunset was so pretty and it meant the end of the day and how everyone else would be able to see it and i always wondering what everyone else was doing while also looking at the sunset or today i saw my sister holding one of her cats and the cat was sleeping and i felt so sad instantly again it was intense with a lot of jumbled thoughts and emotions all of them came together to form a huge confused sadness i could make out things like i guess how the cat could be so content with something so simple like being pet and in turn how my sister could seem content with something to small and simple like a little cat and also i guess how it would be a while until i saw them again since im leaving next week i mean it happens a lot small things upset me so intensely certain images like sunsets and people playing with cats strike me as so intense and full of meaning even tho they seem simple it just kinda makes me feel empty and meaningless anyone else have that,Suicidal Reference
I have such a love hate apathetic thing with bpd It s so nice to finally have a name for what is wrong with me When I first got diagnosed I was deluding myself in thinking that the knowledge and self awareness would somehow cure me I let go of a ton of shame and embarrassment that had accumulated over the years and almost instantly moved from hopeless to hopeful Unfortunately though self knowledge doesn t cut it Not even close I can usually identify what behavior is me and what is the disorder but I still can t stop it even when I realize it in the moment And as if adding insult to abandonment injury I feel completely alone in my experiences I ve genuinely tried to explain vent theorize about bpd to my friends my mother the only family I ve got and a few lovers But almost as soon as I bring it up the conversation comes to a stand still I don t know if it s the stigma or if these people genuinely don t know what to say or what I need some camaraderie I need to be able to talk about what is going on with me and the implications of my disorder witout immediately feeling tension arise when I speak out about it I ve never really messed with reddit but I m glad I thought about it as a possible resource Reading through these posts and the few comments messages I ve given received have given me a sense of belonging and only a little paranoia should I have said that Am I being insensitive Am I talking about myself too much Do I always talk about myself too much Am I annoying Etc etc Even when the people around me have the best intentions they seem to fall a little short in the relatability understanding advice departments And that s as frustrating for them as it is for me I feel myself starting to get jaded about this stuff which I guess is where the apathy comes in I wonder how much improvement is really possible I wonder if the chaos is too comfy for me to be able to let go of it I m not ready to give up though I want to be well and if I ve learned anything over the course of my life it s that no one is coming to save me not even from myself I have to do it I have to become well on my own Probably it will be on my own terms by my own experiments by own rules Which may ultimately cause a lot of bad shit to happen But I m kinda ok with that More than likely I ll survive I mean I always have ya know Or maybe I won t and then I ll be dead so who cares Lol jk kinda,Suicidal Reference
I am completely head over heels with my now ex boyfriend Looking back I ve treated him poorly but he s always stayed by my side He s always held my hand Never given up on me never given up on our love Reassured me that I was the love of his life that we would be married one day But the fighting got so bad We fought every day I broke up with him every week I told him he was nothing to me that I didn t love him Slowly I destroyed him He began to resent me Began to question if I even loved him Read all the scary online articles about BPD relationships and went running the other direction Fell out of love with me but was too afraid to tell me so he turned to online dating sites and texting girls behind my back over this past month I freaked out when I found out yesterday I asked him to see his phone and he willingly handed it over In it there were replies from craigslist personals in his inbox nude photos of other girls and he admitted he also signed up for a dating site On top of that he d been texting another girl for almost two weeks He told me he was sorry for hurting me but he had checked out of our relationship weeks ago and was no longer in love with me The fighting had destroyed him the good outweighed the bad and he wasn t happy anymore He told me that he had reminded me time and time again we needed counseling and he felt like he was out of options And I was angry and I screamed at him and packed all my shit we lived together and left HE was the cheating scum And today I realize I pushed him away It doesn t excuse cheating but I would have left me too And now he hasn t so much as tried to contact me since the incident he called me a few times in the afternoon yesterday which I rejected amp texted me about our dog I found his dating profile and he s been active on it even updated it He s been messaging girls over kik and exchanging nude photos I know I can t be angry because we re broken up but I ve been sitting here completely shattered and he s been out searching for a rebound fuck I never thought he would really leave me and I m having a hard time letting go It hurts so much I thought I would marry him I thought he was the love of my life I just feel so empty and alone and he s the one person I want to talk to that I can t A lot of this was my own doing He really has tried and I took it for granted and now I lost him Because I was too damn stubborn to see outside myself I m so fucking hurt I m a mess I want to die I m also due to give birth in three weeks the child is his and I feel like I m just going to be a mess of a person He s never not contacted me after we ve broken up he s never not tried That s how I know he means it s really over and he really has fallen out of love with me I don t know who I am without him I don t know who could love me And the only coping skill that s worked is complete disassociation cause the reality hurts too fucking much,Suicidal Reference

Attempted suicide again Third time this year I ve been pulled into the hospital by police and third time I ve managed to convince them I m okay and don t need to be in a ward I honestly just don t know what to do anymore I want to get better I do but every therapist I ve dealt with over the past decade has always been useless I refuse to go on medication but perhaps it s a good idea I m scared I m hurt and it keeps getting worse no matter what I do I was diagnosed four years ago and the syptoms all trace back to when I was around eight years old I m twenty one now Nearly fourteen years of this pain and suffering I just want it to be over,Suicidal Reference
Since I can remember I have the worst BPD attacks on celebration days birthdays and graduations It s an attention thing like I m never getting enough I always want to lash out at loved ones on days like this It s fucked The most common time I would get suicidal or severely angry was around my birthday It was like something would just come over me Low and behold it happened today What set it off was someone texting me asking how come I wasn t at graduation They said the director of the program asked why I wasn t there I said wow they actually learned my name cause the director never learned my name as far as I know So that brought out a shit ton of rage I had to do the self soothing like it s okay it s a BPD attack that s why you re angry it s not you you re not a bad person I was doing the self talk while looking in the mirror Has anyone tried that I find it to be really grounding It took a couple of hours though The feelings would fall and then climb back up if I saw something that I didn t like and I would react Like seeing a photo of a friend with a new gf Again the rage climbs Why can t I find a gf Despite my promise to myself to avoid relationships for awhile Man this is a really insidious disease It really plays tricks on you I can t believe I was actually able to call out that I was having an attack Still have some of the symptoms though Like I ll start mindlessly ruminating unless I stay really focused I have to stay really friggin busy tomorrow,Suicidal Reference

Diagnosed BPAD 2 possibly BPAD 1 and diagnosed BPD So I spent a very long time moderately severely depressed probably about 5 years intermittently and mildly moderately depressed since I was 6 or 7 Now I haven t been depressed since December But in my stability I have not achieved a state of functioning It seems like I can t do it I ve nailed down brushing my teeth I get dressed most days and I shower every other day I take my meds religiously I eat 3 times a day even though the meals are all over the place But these are huge milestones that I have accomplished since I was depressed However I still can t function in many of the basic ways laundry errands rent bills keeping plans sleeping and waking times cooking house mate usually cooks cleaning even the basics keeping hydrated Not to mention things like working and studying those things are something to think about in the future I can function in bursts though that is the thing I can certainly do it but not for long I ll have about 1 week where I m functioning okay and 2 4 weeks where I function poorly No matter how much I want to keep going it crashes In my family we learned nothing of use As a kid I had head lice for years I never brushed my teeth I never did my homework we never helped out with housework My mother gave an example of underachievement and laziness while my dad worked hard everyday until arthritis meant he had to go on disability I have nothing but admiration for my dads work ethic but he was not really there to lead as an example while we were growing up I moved out at 16 and I ve had to learn how to be an adult from myself and the people around me I m 26 now and I struggle with the basics where as everyone else has moved on to the next part of functioning and living their lives I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders I m seeing a psychologist I was meant to be seeing her for 8 months its now almost 2 years later and its coming to an end It s going to be hard because I don t feel ready but at the same time I m sick shit of therapy I ve just started seeing an occupational therapist I like her she s funny But its fucking overwhelming I don t even know what it is about it but the guilt and anxiety is building up because of this and crippling me I m completely overwhelmed I don t know how to even approach the next step not to mention the rest I can barely even handle THIS step I feel like I can t do more than the very basics and if I do it just crashes and burns again after a week anyway I can only manage bursts I m grateful that I have some time to function but I can t live my life like this and my house mate is basically my carer It s humiliating and I wish it were not like this It s all too much too quick I m switching service I m ending therapy I m starting occupational therapy and I m trying to function Not to mention all of the other health things I m trying to sort out And after 4 months of being okay I suddenly want to overdose to escape all this pressure guilt and anxiety It s really too much I want to be in the safe and quiet away from my life I know better now though But I m just scared So yeah I guess I just needed to vent I ve been using the skills from therapy but the feelings keep emerging over and over again with the same intensity I don t know this transition has bad news written all over it,Suicidal Reference
It seems like every time I feel like I am getting close to recovery I fall back into the dark pit of self hate and severe depression If no one was there to be hurt by my death I would almost certainly kill myself I feel so hopeless and feel like a failure Working only 30 hours a week is killing me and I want to cut myself every day but my old scars remind me that I don t need more Of course sitting alone at home would probably be much worse I am just so sick of living I want to give up and die I ve been telling myself things will get better for years and have been in and out of mental institutions and have seen multiple therapists I feel like nothing ever changes except my age Recovery from this is starting to feel like some unreachable goal,Suicidal Reference
Way too many details and nuances to be anything but reductive in this post but could use some perspective on what frame of mind I should be in Married for 12 years Three kids My wife is diagnosed BPD She was undiagnosed a year ago A year ago she came out to me as bi and told me she was in love with a woman and if I didn t let her explore the relationship she would leave me and take the kids Stating also that if the relationship with this woman did not work out she would start a new life on her own I was about to deploy She was about out the door All of this was confusing and heart breaking Three months into the deployment she came out as gay on Facebook and sent me an email saying she was not bi She is gay and wants a divorce A month later I am home Planning a divorce She s seen a lawyer I m about to Then she s really confused and thinks she s bi She doesn t want to lose either of us She starts cutting Threatening suicide Attempting suicide I have her admitted She starts therapy and is diagnosed BPD She promised this girl a life together and each time this girl pushes her to leave me my wife is cutting and threatening to kill herself from the pressure to choose or the grief of loss Nine times in six months they broke up Each time there are scars Some she attributes to me Others to her She starts lithium and goes numb Now she is off lithium and can t remember a single thing about the last six months She doesn t know who she is She doesn t know if she is gay or bi She doesn t want me to leave her She s already lost her GF although they still talk She wants me to stay with her until she knows for sure I m struggling She was a stay at home mom and homeschooler The most amazing mom and wife in the world Now I have my kids in school and full time care on their days off because she can t take care of them The splitting the pushing away is soul crushing I find solace in my children In my work And in therapy Why don t you just divorce her People tell me daily to leave her Get custody I think I am messed up because I don t think it s right to leave someone who isn t there I wouldn t be divorcing her I would be divorcing someone else Someone who right now is sick and barely knows what is going on I m staying Stupid as it sounds But to what end Do I lose myself in the process Am I falling on my sword,Suicidal Reference

I am a 26 year old male turning 27 in two months It s been three years since I had a job and before that it was another two I ve only worked one job longer than a year and that was only barely I have mainly worked in coffee shops with a couple other retail food service type stuff I found this sub about a week ago and everything seems to just fit I told a story in a different thread about how I quit my job once because I gave somebody the wrong pastry and then broke down in tears The rapid changes between being completely committed to someone one minute and then trying to find reasons to ever talk to them again because they did something mildly annoying Feeling like a sponge who just absorbs other people s personalities without ever contributing anything This was a gigantic wall of text stream of consciousness It felt really good to write it out but it s not directly relevant I m going to move it to a comment below tl dr is that I ve had a series of customer service type jobs with gaps in between and dropped out of college 3 times Then I was going to kill myself but chickened out and after a hospital stay moved back in with my dad I gained 80 pounds the first year of just staying home and am now noticeably obese I m embarrassed to leave my house and my clothes are mostly ill fitting I have no friends from any phases of my life except for a few people I met online through gaming and they re not really close friends as much as gaming buddies I no longer have a car and biking isn t really an option so getting a job would be difficult I have no insurance so I can t seek treatment or medication I ve considered committing some sort of crime just to have the structured environment of prison The military is out of the question for a number of reasons I know it s unfair to ask random strangers on the internet how to live my life but I m really at a loss I ve dug myself so far into this hole that I don t know how to even start getting out Any advice especially guidance on what research I need to do would be greatly appreciated,Suicidal Reference
I ve been seeing a guy for about six months or so I get irrationally angry at him sometimes for no reason When he pushes back in my head this means he doesn t love care about me I left his house in a huff on Sunday Then sent him 4 text messages that he never replied to I sent him 3 more this morning he replied while I was typing and was livid by the lack of response So much so that I contemplated telling him I was going to kill myself I ve done this before in the past with a different person or two prior to therapy I always thought it was no big deal because I wasn t really going to do it My therapist told me that s not something healthy people resort to Makes sense So I vowed to never do it again But I had to FIGHT the urge Fight so hard to not do it this time around He knows of my suicide ideation and my plans to check out at forty I ve got six years My mind used this a rationalization for saying it now Again I did fight the urge But I hate that my mind went there My goal would not be to intentionally manipulate only get across my level of sadness at being ignored I m supposed to be a fucking adult,Suicidal Reference
Most of the time this manifests as feeling as though the friendship is very superficial distant as though I don t mean very much to the other person And this often means friends don t stick around because I undervalue the relationship But there s some friendships where apparently I feel I am more important to the other person than I actually am I overvalue the relationship Like I feel there s a meaningful connection and that we are close friends who are able to be open with one another and I would drop everything to help them out even though they live several hours away This often happens when someone is kind and gives me some sort of friendly affection or is just generally not a cunt And then when something happens that shows I am not special to the other person it destroys me actually destroys me It s like my entire world comes crashing down and my tentative view of myself as maybe being an ok person and not bad is incinerated and I am left with nothing but agony and emptiness and I want to die so that the pain stops and so that no one can ever leave me ever again Even if they haven t actually said they don t want me in their life the suggestion that they don t care for me as much as I care for them is tantamount to abandonment Also this can be something like not replying to a text they don t even have to say anything I want to stop being like this I want to stop being so clingy and needy I don t know how to assign an appropriate value to a relationship And it makes me feel like everyone hates me because I always feel like even in the friendships that I believe Aren t that close the other person still thinks even less of the friendship AND THIS PROBABLY MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE I AM RAMBLING AND HURTING AND I CANT SEE BECAUSE TEARS,Suicidal Reference

So in February I finished a 4 month hospitalization following a pretty severe depressive episode after quitting university I felt like my life was in pieces back then After the stay I felt pretty confident started to work on my relationship with my dad started to apply to an Ausbildung which is like 3 years training for a job in a company here in Germany and had a bunch of job interviews since April But lately I ve started to struggle again falling back into my cycle which is dive into something wholeheartedly then realizing something isn t going my way slowly fall into depression It s just so frustrating having many people tell me that I have excellent requirements for the job get positive feedback after the job interviews yet not getting one Additionally my landlord just hinted that she may throw me out claiming I didn t pay the rent which I KNOW I paid ON TIME after the monthly struggle to collect it from my roommates looking at my bank statements I just feel myself slipping I m shaking constantly from tension I have the urge to hurt myself again It s been 5 months since the last time I have less energy every day and I have 3 job interviews this week It feels like the small shelter I ve built myself is slowly being torn down by a hurricane of my emotions and things beyong my control Right now I don t know how to help myself,Suicidal Reference
Has anybody else just felt this way I hope I m not the only one I just feel so much pressure constantly and from every angle that I am not sleeping feel nauseous more often than not and now I am just done I ve had to take a week off work because I can t actually cope with having to fake the happiness and deal with customers in a calm way whilst trusting myself not to go off on one when they inevitably say something that grates on me It s like every little negative thing that has happened to me over the past few months or even years has been stored away waiting to come back on me amplified tenfold to torment me and drive me to exhaustion Why is it that I cannot process my issues deal with them and move on Or at least accept them for what they are and learn to coexist with them Every decision I ve made is the result of a million questions like well if I do x what if y happens What if I do this but then they say this and think that and leave If I say yes then this might happen and this then that What would I do then I could do x y or z but then and on and on it goes My anxiety is seemingly intensifying rather than finding a way to let me breathe and it is only making it harder for me to leave the house and engage in social activities without making me feel completely drained afterwards As if all of this isn t enough there is the constant paranoia and obsessive thoughts that one day I m going to be ditched by every last person I love I feel it is only a matter of time because after all that is what always happens It is so damn draining having this constant war in my mind between needing to be loved and needed and also wanting to be alone because I can t handle the pain of being open with someone about my issues and how much I love them only to have them leave me even in the times when they actively encourage me to share my emotions because they re adamant emotions don t scare them and they aren t going anywhere that just seems cruel Every time I m left crushed I say to myself that I won t do it again won t put myself out there but I know that is a lie because the only thing worse than the paranoia of being repeatedly crushed is the torment of being alone To be alone with only my thoughts is the worst possible thing I could ever imagine I wouldn t survive that I make myself worse too and give myself more reasons to hate on myself Like today I know the animals need food and that I have to go out to buy them some but I still can t find the energy to get dressed and face leaving the house I fucking hate myself for it I know that I will have to at some point today but you can guarantee that I will leave it until as late as possible because that s what I do avoid reality as best as I can until it smacks me in the face and I can t run away any longer Like sure I know in the back of my mind that they have plenty of hay and such to see them through as that is the most important thing for them anyway but still they need the food and I can t even sort my fucking life out enough to go into town now What is wrong with me Now I m just done I can t carry on like this I don t know how or where I could possibly even imagine I d get the energy or strength of mind from I m just done Please tell me I m not the only one who feels this way,Suicidal Reference

I relapsed badly My partner knew from the start about the ones covering my left arm from eight years ago it s not like he didn t know anything about it I never thought I d relapse so I didn t talk much about it at all and he didn t seem too worried When we got back together after a long time apart he noticed three new ones on my arm asking if any of them were because of him I said it was due to getting back with my ex after breaking up and I was shocked he asked so calmly That was about a month ago and with the damage I did not too long ago I couldn t bare let him know especially with EVERYTHING going wrong because of my complete emotional instability and not being able to offer him anything stable I could only imagine being honest about it would destroy us forever I used not being comfortable with sex as a cover due to the location saying I felt uncomfortable not wearing clothes to bed As much as I wanted to let him know about some realizations of things in my childhood and teenage years in regards to sex and how it all affects me so strongly to this day he was having none of it he couldn t trust what I was saying The next morning it got even worse and I wanted to tell him but I couldn t he said he s done if I m taking sex out of our relationship because I can t offer him anything else in order to feel close He s done with the constant up and downs and taking sex away leaves us just as friends he says I couldn t fight with him he than asked if I was having an outbreak I said I m worried and I don t have an actual reason to be because I haven t noticed anything This hurt him even more because in his mind I was going to tell him this last and not right away saying he could of accepted that but using all this emotional drama beforehand has caused him to feel betrayed I ve betrayed his trust I ve betrayed his trust in a way he doesn t even know of I honestly felt incredibly suicidal all night and all of the morning I was with him he says he s not dropping me as a person and that he feels sad for me and it hurts him to see me constantly hitting so many roadblocks still He loves me but having a relationship with me is unhealthy and unsafe for him we can still be friends and I m allowed to go up and see him and give him hugs but what am I going to do live with this forever if we get back together constantly using professional makeup to cover the scars waiting for the day I have to use some emotionally drastic situation as a cover up and a lie as to when I did it and why I ve fucked myself over and I don t even regret the SH I suppose I should acknowledge how completely fucking emotionally manipulative I ve become in regards to the torture I inflicted on myself,Suicidal Reference

I had a medical assessment and I was reluctant to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder I found out a day or two ago that I actually have Borderline Personality Disorder specifically and was diagnosed with it A lot of problems I have in my life make sense because of this disorder and I Äôd like to share an experience or two with you just to get them off of my chest Big TW in some aspects These are all really destructive and kind of violent but as I said they Äôre to get them off of my chest I Äôd never say them to my girlfriend or family or anybody so saying it here in anonymity when my girlfriend doesn Äôt have reddit and nor do my family is best p I have been with my girlfriend for a considerable amount of time and now I have what I Äôd previously call separation anxiety Whenever she goes to her grandparents or is away from me and my company for more than a day I threaten to hurt myself excessively as well as threaten suicide and that I feel like she just doesn Äôt give a shit about me and my mental health as far as reverting to Äújust fucking go I don Äôt care Just fucking go and enjoy yourself Äù this usually happens over text and not verbally The same goes for social events if she wants to go to a party I really won Äôt let her She has cheated on me in the past I know this might not be a good relationship to be in because of this and I am scared of it happening again She has told me she basically goes for anybody who gives her attention I Äôm scared of her going to parties and I yell at her and threaten to hurt myself until she agrees not to go or I have to go with her I go almost everywhere with her even if she has work I will go to the area where she works and linger around usually in other stores and periodically flick back to where she works to just browse to make sure she isn Äôt being hit on or she isn Äôt flirting with coworkers of any gender Sometimes people with disabilities will show interest in her as a subject as opposed to a sexual interest and I get insanely jealous defensive blunt with her and just barely acknowledge her then I get scared of these individuals as I think they want to hurt me because they know I Äôm her boyfriend even though there Äôs no hint to us being together at all I Äôve found I idealize people to a creepy extent as well I have apologized to the two most recent people this has happened to and promised to take big steps to improve myself which is already happening and I can see it I Äôve gone as far as using their names nicknames their website layouts their characters and art style listening to the music they like but not if I don Äôt truly like it mimicking their blog posts buying clothes similar to theirs trying to lose weight to be a similar weight etc It Äôs caused them distress one of which has BPD as well and it Äôs given them severe issues from it so I started to take this seriously and try to cut it out If I go to their websites and there Äôs something I want to copy I think Äòno this isn Äôt ok I wouldn Äôt write draw whatever this Äô and then I manage to not do it They Äôve made call out posts for me and their entire group of friends hate me and I Äôve copied only the art styles characters from their friends here and there I remember doing this all my life as I did the same thing when I was 8 14 on different websites where I would use usernames characters art text and use it as my own I stopped during 14 17 then picked it up again recently I used to catfish a lot and talk to people not using my face or name but I think this is mostly explained by something else that I don Äôt want to discuss though does tie in with idealization I suppose I then go on to hate these people thinking they Äôre disgusting and up themselves and I will check their blog constantly to see if they Äôve been hurt been happy recently and when they Äôve been hurt I feel good and if they Äôre happy I feel bad and that I want to be happy too but I can Äôt Because of this entire issue I don Äôt know who I am at all and my entire personality is just a mish mash of everybody I Äôve idealized in the past I Äôve sort of found myself and I don Äôt like that person at all because they Äôre cold and uncaring but happy and bubbly and none of it makes sense to me I get irrationally angry and lash out at my girlfriend a lot for no reason but I Äôve never hit her or anything accept for one time but that was a fluke accident in which I was too angry to control and she was antagonizing me by doing something I couldn Äôt understand which stressed me out more I get really randomly bitter about random things and sometimes I associate it with a memory and sometimes it just happens Same goes for anxiety I Äôve noticed I Äôm never just annoyed or just nervous or just sad let alone just happy or just excited I Äôm always angry anxious depressed full of joy and giddy respectively the latter being when I manage to actually show excitement haha never in between never a minor emotion though sometimes I just don Äôt feel anything at all and will do something destructive like hurting myself another person to feel something These next things are things I do that I don Äôt know if they are characteristic of the disorder or if they Äôre just me so feel free to give input I fiddle with my hands a lot I Äôll wring them when I don Äôt know what to do with them not triggered by anxiety I Äôll also clench and unclench my hands a lot I also have to keep my hands close to my body I can Äôt hold something a ways away from my body without slowly pulling it towards me eventually It will always drift closer to me I like to clean A lot But only at night In the morning afternoon I can never be bothered to do anything I can Äôt even get out of bed sometimes but at night I Äôm ready to go I Äôm ready to clean the whole house heck I Äôll clean the entire apartment block and the entire street if I have to I Äôm ready My rates are 5 an hour I can be really quiet too I Äôm also good with kids Another condition gives me insomnia so I can just stay up all night and organize my desk over and over or organize my files on my laptop or re order my video games into alphabetical age genre etc I Äôm so entirely anti porn I think it Äôs disgusting as hell and it Äôs all too fake and too glorified and I yell at others for watching it Then I watch it And it Äôs my favourite thing ever and I could watch it for hours I Äôm trapped in porn hell I Äôm really open to sharing stories of myself if you hadn Äôt guessed I used to tell everybody all of my personal intimacies but then I just figured nobody actually cares so I stopped doing this I now only talk about things that matter if we disregard this post When I can Äôt get to sleep I kick and fidget violently and hit the walls and get insanely angry and I Äôll writhe and bite myself scratch myself go to the toilet and cut myself Occasionally I catch myself and just get up and play a video game or something Äòtil I feel tired usually an hour or two I think I Äôm abusive manipulative horrible controlling all the while I think I Äôm not I get told I am now and then and I get stuck in a fuss about it I don Äôt think I Äôm abusive then I Äôll say something like ÄúDon Äôt do that thing Äù then suddenly I Äôm abusive and controlling the person it Äôs aimed at Everybody but the person I Äôm apparently controlling has said I Äôm controlling though even though I Äôve told her if I am just tell me so I can hurry up to try and change it Nada Out of my symptoms that she knows I can Äôt manage right now she knows I Äôm not purposefully trying to hurt her in anyway Ironically it Äôs her Narcissistic mother who controls her and her enabler friends and family that said I Äôm abusive for the most part Nobody else sees it in me I sit and stare a lot Mainly when I have nothing to do I Äôll sit and stare at a point and not move for a long long time Sometimes blinking a lot sometimes never blinking I also find a lot I Äôll do something then two minutes later cannot remember a single thing about what I was doing or how I did it or what anybody else was doing and I think that Äôs possibly a dissociative amnesia Eh that Äôs all I Äôve got can think of I Äôm getting a little bored of typing But feel free to give input I just felt like venting a little bit and sharing how I feel,Suicidal

Please bear with me I know the sidebar and I m a strict adherent to rules here 90 of the time but as a diagnosed Borderline myself how do I stop my kid brother from falling into the abyss that this disorder is This post involves speculation only because he is too young to be diagnosed for good reason You shouldn t want anyone to be diagnosed with this at the age of 14 his age but he is too much like me for me not to post this here He will end up like me possibly even worse if he stays on this trajectory so bear with me and help me if you can I understand that some of you may not want to help and I m fine with that Thank you It is so incredibly depressing My brother is about to enter high school I m in college and am about to enter my junior year I ve been the only male role model my brother has had for a very long time He never had the father figure that I had my Grandfather the one that at least gave me something to strive for Our father recently came back into our lives after abandoning us when I was 12 and has been causing all sorts of hell for all of us He was incredibly abusive to me and he was a diagnosed Narcissist Combine that with a mother with severe anxiety and depression and you get me the diagnosed Borderline Of course my brother still idealizes the idea of a father since I ve been a not so great role model for him I ve tried my best but it is hard I m not his father I m still not sure of who I am I m fucked up And what is crazy is that my brother is an even more extreme version of me His fear of abandonment Incredible I m sitting in my room at the old apartment and he ll call my name over and over in the middle of the night just to make sure I haven t left him Just a couple days ago our mom wasn t home and I was over at my girlfriend s apartment and my brother blew up Mom s phone with texts and calls did the same thing to mine and then smashed his phone against a wall and then beat the shit out of it with a hammer I was driving him yesterday and he told me that he doesn t trust himself behind the wheel of a car because he knows he ll be a Speedy Gonzalez like me and then told me that his self esteem at the moment was at an all time low He has an eating disorder terrified of getting fat one that could probably be described as anorexic BMI of 15 8 His mood swings are even more extreme than mine and that is really saying something He idealizes and devalues me like crazy Part of that is his mood swings I m the best brother in the world I m a piece of shit Same thing with our mom What sucks is that I know that he needs to speak to someone I ve brought it up with both my therapist and my psychiatrist because I know that he s gonna be diagnosed with Borderline down the road if he ever seeks help and his behavior progresses to the level that I m at suicidal self mutilating impulsive bastard I m a diagnosed Borderline Our mom shows some traits Our father is as I mentioned a diagnosed Narcissist the same as my disowned sister Basically what I am asking is for advice preferably from those of you with teenaged kids or siblings that are like you I m not gonna force my brother into therapy There is no point if they don t want to improve themselves What I m asking is if there is anything that I can do to help him before his behavior progresses to my level I went through the same shit the same stages when I was his age I know where this road goes and its not a fun place Is there any way I can help him before it s too late How can I be a better father figure to him these next few crucial years It just seems like its my fault that he s ended up this way because I m all he s had as a role model for all these years,Suicidal Reference
OK I m coming to Reddit to look for an answer I can t find anywhere else and believe me I ve tried My husband is a long time Redditor and he suggested I bring my question here he said there s a good chance I may get an answer that works for me This is my first post so please go easy on me because I m terrified even writing this BUT I NEED HELP I have BPD along with it comes an extremely severe case of depression Some days I do OK but some I don t I m doing everything possible to treat this meditation exercise medication diet therapy you name I ve tried it including an upcoming round of ECT to help fight the depression When I get depressed there is only one thought in my mind and it has landed me in the hospital for multiple suicide attempts So here s the question What s the point Mankind has been on this earth for exactly a blip in time We will continue to be here for maybe one or two more The universe however is infinite it was here long before us and will be here long after we are gone So what is the point in anything I do 300 years after humans are gone there will be no signs left that we were even here Therefore in my depression riddled mind nothing I do matters I don t matter Nothing does I do not believe in God or heaven or hell I believe in the energy of the universe that s it Now on a good day I can tell myself that by helping others and being a good person I AM making a difference to for them That I am changing the energy around me into a brighter and better thing I feel the energy of those around me that have left and some very cosmic things have happened in my life to show me that the energy of this universe is very real But I have no scientific things to back it up If you understand BPD at all and you are kindly taking the time to read all of this you know things are very black and white for me no room for gray I guess I m hoping someone could give me either a logical or scientific response to my BPD Depression induced question of What s the Point While I wait on these ect treatments my depression is getting worse by the day I m now to the point where I m hiding how bad it is from my husband because he s had to deal with me enough So I m exposing myself for the first time EVER and desperately asking for help Another thing we BPDers don t do What is the point,Suicidal Reference
And I wanted to share it with you guys I know one of the big things about BPD is a fear of abandonment and over attachment to others Hell it s one of my worst triggers and always has been It keeps me up at night sometimes So naturally when my ex broke up with me this time last year I felt like I might as well have died And when he left in April long story we were tied into a house and job contract I felt like I had died I moved back in with my parents aged 25 Slowly hour by hour at the beginning day by day now I have come to realise a few simple truths 1 I can function on my own I ve always hated having to do things on my own so I avoided it At school I used to convince my friends to go everywhere with me Growing up my sister and I spent our lives in each other pockets until she left for uni so going from living with someone to not seeing them anymore and having to do things like shopping and visiting places on my own was quite frankly terrifying But I can do it And I can do it well Recently I went away overnight with work I know that if I was still with my ex I d have grabbed a sandwich from the Tesco Express below my hotel and stayed in my room all night watching TV and texting him Instead I went out did some shopping in a very busy city and ate dinner In a restaurant On my own 2 I can develop my own path All through our relationship both of us fell into the trap of saying I want to do this and never doing it Two weeks after he left I applied for a Masters program in my dream career thinking fuck it nothing to stop me if I don t get in then oh well I got an interview and this Friday just gone I got a letter of acceptance It s really happening This dream that I ve been putting off since 2013 is finally going to happen I probably wouldn t have applied for it if I was still with him A long term goal of mine is to interrail around mainland Europe everyone I know is dead set against me going on my own but there is so much I want to see 3 I am my own person This one s a bit odd but I hope some of you will relate I find a lot of the time I rely on others to give me worth and to show me what I should do I m not a massively independent person I lived with my ex for two years in that time I stopped doing so many things because he didn t do them I stopped reading I used to go to the gym but only if he pushed me to it I didn t go out with friends if he wasn t going I stopped writing as a late teen I used to write alllll the time I didn t watch TV shows he didn t want to watch Now I ve started to read again I run three four times a week as well as two exercise classes I m volunteering for a charity and last week I went to a rugby match with people I barely know Part of it has been the natural progression of maturity I was a very immature 19 year old when we started going out but a lot of it has been that I ve been forced out of my comfort zone with a shove I have a natural tendency to sit back and let others carry me along and when there s no one there to do that I just have to get on with it Whilst I loved him with all my heart and am nowhere near close to feeling ok without him in my life I am starting to see now that he was smothering my natural abilities We were stuck in a push and pull of anger and dependence and it wasn t healthy for either of us Rather than letting each of us blossom and grow we acted like cocoons for each other hiding away the progression of life I m not going to lie and say it s been easy every day is a struggle and I m trying so hard to not go back to my destructive habits I don t think I ll ever stop missing him and I don t know if the aching hole in my heart will ever be filled Some mornings may be most mornings if I m honest I can t be fucked with it all again I want to go run away fly off to some hot place drive my car over to France jump off the cliffs of Dover or into the nearest canal a lot of the time At weekends I desperately long for my late teen years where I went out and got off my face every night just because I could and maybe finding someone else s bed to go and sleep in the lack of friends stops me there But I m alive I m still here And fuck am I still fighting I ll go down swinging at the very least,Suicidal Reference

I ve been attending DBT since early February and to cut a long story short overall I really feel no big difference I still dissociate a lot i still have extreme suicidal ideation i still feel alone even around people i still feel i have no purpose in the world i find the language of the skills are often confusing and I notice that they contradict each other a lot Lately I have been skipping and avoiding DBT simply because I am losing faith in it I totally admit a lot of it s to do with me and the way I think and perceive things I don t want to shift all the blame onto the mental health service because that would be totally unfair I go in each week very pessimistic about my chances of recovery and have been told many times that I need to change my underling pessimism to stand any real chance of improvement To that end I had been applying the skills as best as I possibly could Noticing negative thoughts labelling them trying to let them slide on by etc But even in that i d have further additional judgemental thoughts about whether that approach works I think pessimistically about pretty much every situation I am in and every thought I have so i guess it s hardly a wonder the skills have no real chance to embed in my mind But going back to the main point I really think DBT isn t for me for many reasons As i mentioned above some is because of the way it s taught and some is on me I don t see either of those things changing though They haven t so far and with each passing day I doubt they will more and more Am i being unfair Have I not given this enough of a chance Am I being unrealistic,Suicidal Reference
So I had to go to an occupational doctor today about my possibly returning to work soon I m so fucking angry right now She basically belittled every mental illness there is and said if people could step back from themselves and look at things logically then they wouldn t have these problems Told me _everyone_ if they went to a psychologist like I did would probably end up being diagnosed with BPD because we all have personalities anyway Went on and on about how if I have food water a roof some friends and can pay my bills then I ve nothing to complain about Funny that because I had all that and more when I actually tried to kill myself I d just gotten a raise in work and was buying a new car Funnily enough none of that mattered when I felt like couldn t live with my thoughts any longer I felt SO belittled and invalidated I m fuming and yet feel so small and insignificant now,Suicidal Reference
Is it completely normal for you to feel and subconciously behave like your own worst enemy whenever I am in an intimate relationship it s ALWAYS BEEN the same thing I m told I m manipulative mentally abusive always making assumptions about intent and motive and what my partner is really feeling and thinking being overly dramatic trying to illicit responses using ALL the avenues to poke prod push and pull in order to have control In my head and in my perspective I see NONE of this behaviour in me and I think my PARTNER is doing all those things or just is not trying to communicate with me or is going to leave me emotionally detaching distancing seeing someone else The only way I can recognize that kind of energy is with how I feel inside a lot of the time when I feel my partner is suddenly the devil and I m looking right at him feeling all this emptiness inside me because I don t see him anymore I see in a whole different light like he s my worst enemy I bury and bury and bury the anger and hurt going on in me because it s so irrational and constantly live in the anxieties I have I m either totally calm and no care in the world or I m fighting my way through my own hell I honestly feel ripped apart right now like I don t even know who I am so afraid I m going to completely detach from reality even though I m always told I am always spacey and distant Lately though since getting back into a relationship I ve never felt more connected to my emotions relapsing with SI twice very badly my ED getting worse my suicidal ideation growing and growing my frantic emotions making me either completely numb or in between a cross fire I ve always known that growing up as a child my parents always had to walk on eggshells around me because my mom always told me I was this way So emotionally responsive to the slightest sign of rejection I was perceiving in my head But neurotically shy and passive around anyone else I started SI as a small child and had my first thoughts of suicide when I was five or six or seven I still blow up when I m interacting with my mother I don t know where it comes from I detach from reality thinking I need to be seen as powerful and in control to feel safe and freak out at the slightest sense of emotions I cannot process calmly I said normal because This is normal to me I don t see or recognize what they say they are seeing or experiencing I only see and recognize what I am experiencing I m no stranger to depersonalize amp derealization I only ever have them occurring at the same time I disassociate to such a stronger degree than I usually am and than absolutely loose my grip on my sense of reality I don t know who I am or where I am or how I got where I am or anyway to identify myself it literally feels like I have just died every time it comes on and I m trapped in terror I m holding back on S H more of my thigh I want to so bad because I feel like I have nothing left my partner is seeing these sides of me that I m not recognizing I feel like I am split into two worlds and I don t know how to feel human,Suicidal Reference

I ve been reading about places in Europe that allow euthanasia for otherwise healthy mentally ill patients How do you feel about this The ONLY thing that gives me pause is the effect it would have on my family Is it unfair of them to not be supportive of suicide as an option to end my lifelong suffering or is it unfair for for me to resent them for this,Suicidal Reference
we live in different cities we just spent a week and a half together and not having the physical connection anymore is becoming impossibly hard it s hard even when I m with him sometimes with my moodswings but I m much better at hiding it and getting over my irrationality without going through an entire trial and tribulation of tears and I want to slit my throat open I love him and I love spending time with him but I can t seem to get out of my head anymore and just appreciate my time with him when i get it I feel like I m ruining or have already ruined the best thing that has happened to me I know he loves me I know he wants me to be happy he proposed to me for God s sake but I can t stop myself from thinking about all the things that can sour that type of bond like how I m boring a lot of the time and also an emotional vampire I don t want this heaviness attached to me or my relationship with him I don t want to be this way anymore,Suicidal Reference

I ve noticed a repeating pattern I ll start a new prescription and I feel optimistic and hopeful that it will help Even if it seems to help at first within weeks I no longer am feeling anything from it This pattern is identical to what happens with work or even interests I start off optimistic and full of creativity but it quickly disappears Is it possible that I am preventing medication from working Or is it the initial optimism what I am interpreting as the drug working at the beginning When I left the hospital they pumped me full of optimism and hope but as my life went back to routine the drugs started to become ineffective I ve tried almost every type of medication to no positive affect My community seems ill equipped at providing services and my distrust of the medical profession may be making my situation even worse I ve noticed that there are times where I am so down that I won t even smoke pot cause I know it could help my feel temporarily better If I do smoke pot but am not open to it making me feel better often I will barely feel any change I recently retried an ADHD medicine that I had some previous success with but has had no effect this time at all when last time it was almost instantaneous My parent s innocently and naively suggested that I might have to fake it til I make it Unfortunately every time I ve tried that I eventually end up suicidal Has anyone else experience this Any suggestions I ve been gripping onto my life with my fingertips and I m becoming convinced that this is how it is always going to be Why do I have to keep sabotaging myself at feeling better,Suicidal Reference
I m not sure if this is the correct place to put it but I thought why not post it Can someone show signs of BPD through incorrect treatment Specifically medication My story is somewhat interesting I suppose and I would like to share it with you gt I went through an extremely traumatic experience about 2 years ago I went into the hospital for psychiatric help in which they automatically prescribed me Ativan and Zoloft I went in for a few more therapy sessions after these were prescribed but the sessions stopped after about a month gt Fast forward to a year later the Ativan was the only thing I felt was working for me I had just started a stressful job and was in an abusive relationship My doctors changed my Zoloft to Prozac and a few months later I went into the ER due to nonstop panic attacks gt I went back into therapy and my doctors took me off of Prozac and put me on Seroquel telling me I had borderline personality disorder since my feelings were intense my mood swings were often and I was exhibiting the BPD symptoms I felt like I was legitimately going crazy All I wanted to do was sleep with people then take my ativan and seroquel and sleep then do it all again when I woke up This was my vicious cycle for a few months gt During these months I found myself cutting I found myself sleeping with strangers I found myself drinking more than I felt comfortable with I found myself pushing my friends away then begging them to come back Life was terrible and I didn t want to live like that anymore gt I wanted to kill myself and after an attempt I laid in bed for several days realizing I couldn t live like this anymore I didn t want to go back to therapy and all I wanted was to get better but my impulses got the best of me gt I eventually decided to try to live without my medication If it worked then it worked If it didn t then nothing would be worse than what I was going through gt After about a month of pure torture of being off these medications I was abusing I came out of it better than ever I just feel guilty for saying I got out of it in such an easy way Now honestly I m not entirely sure if I had BPD My doctors and therapists said I did a team of 5 doctors What I felt was real and I truly do believe them,Suicidal Reference

Ok so first post And long I m sorry A bit nervous but here goes I ve been in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for over a year and a half I attend sessions weekly I m married to my high school sweetheart of 10 years and have two kids Currently I m staying at home with the kids per my SO request since staying home means I handle all the cooking cleaning grocery shopping and various errands His responsibility is just work I have several college degrees and certifications and have recently just decided I m going back to college in the fall to pursue my dream career while I m home with little ones However Lately it s bothering me that I never wanted to be a mom which my SO knew about but he wanted kids so I complied which has been hard for me The role of mom is one of the hardest things I ve ever done I feel like my existence is always for someone else I absolutely feel needed but not wanted I don t enjoy being a mom I feel like no matter what I do I m not a good mom I m constantly in fear that I will mess my kids up Being a mom takes all of my free time I m exclusively breastfeeding my youngest so I m never apart from him This has been a hard trigger for me because I feel like I m losing my identity I can t even get myself on autopilot I feel upset that my SO gets freedom Freedom to me is even getting to go to work and leave the house alone and not worry about the safety and health of our two kids constantly My SO also goes out regularly with friends family and coworkers To the movies comic conventions etc But as a couple we don t go out because he doesn t want to be responsible for finding a sitter and my family isn t reliable as I have an extremely abusive family So our time alone is limited to say the least I feel as if we are drifting apart and the only thing we have in common are our children To add the icing to the cake my SO has Aspergers which I didn t realize for years because I have an Autistic older brother so everything always seemed normal to me Which has been hard to swallow in the most recent years A lot of my feelings of rejection are the way he responds or the lack of response on his part I don t know how to fix this My therapist has said that I need to focus on just myself and be responsible for my children And to pretend that I m doing it as a single mom since that s how it feels and I love my SO and don t want to leave my marriage But I feel like this is not what I signed up for this is not what I wanted I don t even know what I want anyways I used to self medicate with marijuana It used to make me feel happy and carefree and relaxed Now it makes me feel depressed and lazy and unmotivated So I have recently quit plus the breastfeeding If I were to return to the workforce I will still be responsible for all of the housework children etc plus add college on top I know I can t handle all of that Recently I wanted to work an early morning stock job at a gardening place nearby and my SO was not supportive AT ALL because he would have to handle the two kids and get ready for work by himself each morning He basically said he didn t want me to take the job because it would mean putting too much on his plate I feel like I m at a place I can t save myself from I m starting to wonder is suicide inevitable I feel as if I will never truly feel happy or content I feel like I will never live my life I m at a point where I want to stop therapy which has cost us thousands and has been stressful just to find a sitter each week most times my SO has to watch the older child as his lunch hour because I always take the baby with me Does anyone really come out from this Or are only dark days ahead I can t take much more And I have tried numerous times to talk to my husband but he feels attacked no matter what way I word it And that just makes me feel worse I ve tried to talk to my therapist about this and she tells me that I m choosing this I don t know how to choose anything else,Suicidal Reference

I m a 20 y o guy that has struggled with episodes of rage and depression my entire life I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in 2011 and have been treated on the basis of that up until today A few days ago I had my first major depressive suicidal episode in almost two years and was admitted into a psych hospital after much convincing by my doctor I could feel myself sliding into a depression so I decided to see my doctor to get a referral to a psychiatrist After speaking with some of the doctors here they are confident that I have BPD I never even knew what it was After reading up on the symptoms every single thing is applicable to me Intense mood swings splitting issues in my friendships and relationships impulsive behaviour self destructiveness and suicidal thoughts etc etc I ve been reading up on BPD and I feel so so much worse I always knew there was something really wrong with me and I thought it was Bipolar I WISH it was bipolar because at least it is treatable It feels like a death sentence I cannot see myself ever finding love or holding down a meaningful friendship my life is a long smoking trail of destroyed and failed attempts to connect with people I feel lost and upset and confused I don t want this Where do I go from here FUCK,Suicidal Reference
i just feel so alone i havent seen my friends in months but they live on my street it just feels like they dont bother or care enough about at me to make the time they know im suicidal i made two references to killing myself in passing to a friend today and in his reply to me he just steamrolled over those comments and talked about something else didnt even mention or ask why i was saying those things it just seems like every attempt i make at reaching out goes not just unnoticed it seems people do notice it theres no way you cant notice a friend joking twice in an hour about killing themselves but dont really care enough to comment on it like they see me struggling and are either too amused to stop it or too bored to care every time i get a reaction of indifference i shut down even more thats why right now i cant find the words to describe it because it hurts so much i just go numb to ignore the pain why would my friend ignore my comments about suicide if my own friends cant ask if im ok why does anything matter,Suicidal Reference
Things just seem to get worse for me as time goes on I m struggling again and I don t know what to do The only person I can turn to is my boyfriend who has his own problems to be dealing with I m a software developer but because of issues recently I ve been out of work a few months and living off illness benefit I ve been waiting to see a psychiatrist since March I ve been struggling with self harm and drugs since my psychologist of a year and a half unexpectedly and suddenly left for a new job back in March they had no one to replace her so I was left to my own demise Money has been tight and I ve already had to take small loans to cover some costs like car insurance tax and medicine The company I work for made an appointment for me to go to an occupational health doctor about an hour away from my home to see about working out coming back to work or so I was told My car broke down on the road on the way to this appointment and I had to call and tell them I couldn t make it I wasn t too far from where my parents lived so managed to get there and have been here since waiting for my car to be fixed the turbo is fucked according to the mechanic My work were really mad I didn t make the appointment and told me they were gonna be charged 400 even though I d missed it I offered to pay this out of my wages when I get back to work They made me another appointment for next week and told me I would be dismissed if I didn t make sure to be there To be honest I m fairly sure they re trying to dismiss me anyway and that s why they re sending me to this doctor so the doctor can tell them I m unfit for the role and then they can just fire me I dunno what I m gonna do Don t even know how I m going to pay for my car or my rent this month now And it s all because I m fucked up in the head and can t just deal with life like a normal person I m getting increasingly anxious My family are completely unsympathetic and won t help me at all My parents have loads of savings but won t help me out even though I ve always paid back every cent they ve ever loaned me years before They basically consider me weak and lazy and don t seem to believe bpd is a real thing They re far more supportive of my sister who s got BDD I m the black sheep The fuck up of the family I ve been sitting in my old room crying for days I can t eat I have to take zopiclone to sleep even the 7 5mg won t work and I had to take 15mg last night I m so freaked out about my future and anxious about all these money troubles I m beginning to think it s time to just give up I have no one and nothing Things only get worse and I m too weak to keep going TLDR I m screwed with money my family treat me like I m invisible don t matter and I m possibly losing my job soon FML,Suicidal Reference
TL DR Got wasted on 4th of July overdosed on meds was held on a 72hr hold in a psych ward Here s what I ve taken from it Not going to lie When you re on a psych hold it is not a fun place It s not like anything from One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest or AHS Asylum not even close But if you want close to zero privacy nurses checking on you literally yes literally even when you re trying to sleep every 15min and crappy hospital food then be my guest BUT It was a relief I had been crying for help for two years now and I finally got the access to resources I desperately needed I was lucky enough to be placed in a nicer ward and it was geared towards people with depression anxiety stress and anger Every day pretty much all day we had group therapies like learning how to identify triggers and treat them coping skills learning mindfulness meditation and seeking spirituality if you would like All of them were optional they d never force you but I noticed that those of us who attended the most groups had better days and were released sooner I was released immediately after my hold for being cooperative with staff taking my meds going to all of the groups I could and signing up for their intensive outpatient program called Duel I have to go 3 4x a week for three hour group sessions and it will not only help with my substance abuse but also the emotional trauma I have endured most of my life It s not going to be easy nor cheap but at this point it s life or death for me For the first time ever I feel I have the proper support system to get through this I am getting better not only for myself but for these people that have seen me hit rock bottom and still have it in them to love me I leave with two acronyms I learned from group therapy OKAY O ne day one step at a time Our problems seem impossible but if we don t take that first step no matter how big we ll never get anywhere K eep a balanced perspective It s never the end of the world Promise A cceptance Accept your grievances Y ou can face your problems You don t have to solve them because all problems cannot be solved Accept them help them if you can move on if you cannot GRAPES to do daily Be G entle with yourself Talk to yourself like a good friend not in guilt or anger R elax Find time for yourself A ccomplish a small goal Find P leasure in something It can be as simple as sitting outside for 30min or listening to music Exercise to make your body and your brain happy no matter how tired you are Be S ocial I know this one can be hard for us but make it simple at first like calling an old friend,Suicidal Reference
the love of my life recently broke up with me and i am not handling it very well i am aware that my stupid BPD brain is causing a lot of the frustration sadness that i m feeling but i just can t make it go away he told me that maybe one day after we have both worked on our own issues we could try again but i can t even bring myself to wanting to be here that much longer all i think about is how badly i want to die and how he would be better off without me around since it feels like whenever i try talking to him he just gets mad i feel like i m a complete waste of space and i don t deserve to be alive anymore i don t want to go to therapy because i hate myself and i don t deserve a happy life he ll get to continue on with his life and he won t have to deal with my childish meltdowns so it s really a win win situation,Suicidal Reference

Trigger warnings So here I am posting here appologies in advance for what is no doubt going to be a massive wall of text For references to ages I m now 21 My story starts growing up in an average if somewhat poor family in the United Kingdom From a young age my parents noticed something was wrong with me yet never sought help most likely for not reading the signs or just putting it down to me being a bit unusual as a child I had very specific habbits I wouldn t eat food unless it was on a certain plate I couldn t use certain types of cutlery wooden handled I d behave inappropriately say inapropriate things to people or get abnormally upset over small things like losing a pair of welly boots in sticky mud in the winter Growing up through primary school I was continuously bullied over various things being poor being fat being ugly etc I recall not having one real or satisfying friendship There was people who I hung with and went round their houses after school but I never felt they understood me or that I understood them I always found it hard to communicate with them specifically to ask for things Things never changed as I got older I missed the first year of secondary school as the children who bullied me in primary school went to the only school with room for me and was homes schooled until the school my sister went to with no problems had a spot and I was able to get it After more 8 9 continuous years of bullying I finally snapped one day when someone was treading on my shoes to make them fall appart and walked out of school and half a mile to the local multi story carpark where I ended up having a breakdown Afterwards I was sent to the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service where after a year or so I was diagnosed as many of you may have guessed by now with Asperger s Syndrome Continuing my school life the bullying never ended and I became more and more aggressive responsive to it There were situations when someone mocked my voice and I pinned him against the wall off the floor by his throat for it or when someone made jokes about my trousers and it took 4 people from the school rugby team and 2 teachers to subdue me Eventually 1 year before my final exams the school decided to put me on a part time time table I would go in for an hour a day to hand in my work and get it marked and get new work to complete at home Thus protecting people from my outbursts and me from the bullies Hindsight is always 20 20 and to me these outbursts are far beyond normal aspie outbursts and thus these are the first signs of my BPD Soon after school finished I d never had a girlfriend much to my sadness but I began speaking to a girl called Alice who I d random added on Facebook because she was cute Things started out great at first we d talk for hours on end after school finished for her There was times she wouldnt respond for hours and I d feel like crying from the pain I felt and then I d see Alice is typing a message appear in MSN and all the pain went away She was the first person to ever make me feel special and also the first person to flirt with me making comments about herself and festive undies Despite only talking for a month or so I class Alice as the only girl I ve ever loved I often talked about meeting up in person she always said she was busy and maybe when she wasn t so busy Then 2 3 days before new years day we spoke about it again and this time it felt like all my dreams had come true We can t until next year but sure Chloe want s to come with me though Chloe being someone I spoke to on a semi regular basis I had no objection This was finally my chance to meet in person with the girl of my dreams Maybe by my birthday I d have met her Maybe we d be going out Maybe I d have finally kissed someone All sorts of thoughts like these flooded my mind for the rest of the evening I dont remember the middle conversation but I recall roughly through the emotion the first true pain in my life And in hindsight one of my first clear BPD outbursts You said you wanted to meet up earlier I was thinking what did you fancy doing I did but Chloe didn t seem to keen on it My mind entered overdrive and ruined everything I remember lots of caps lock Demanding why Chloe had changed her mind why would I hurt the one person I ve ever cared about and who ever made me feel special why would I be happy for chloe to be with us when we met if I was planning something What chloe thinks I m going to fucking rape you or what and continued like that until I ended up telling her to go away and leave me alone We didn t speak for several days after that until around 05 01 Roughly 2 weeks before my Birthday I recall Alice messaging me trying to build bridges and I pushed her away Eventually I calmed down and tried to build my own bridges but the damage I d done was irreparable Years went by and I thought of Alice every day I read our chat logs over and over multiple times per week I made multiple fake Facebook and emails to try and get in contact with me asked multiple people we both knew to try and help me all to no avail Still I longed for a girlfriend and the feelings Alice had given me but no luck ever came my way Every girl I liked friendzoned me or I scared away Eventually I got a job at the local supermarket After 9 months I became convinced that more money would make girls look past how ugly I am and I made the move to nightshifts Bad move Within 3 months I was signed off Whilst on day shifts my anger was somewhat manageable but on nights I turned into a complete monster The tiniest thing triggered me If the packaging of a can of red bull fell apart I would wipe out the entire shelf stacking Many people ended up terrified of me during this period I confided in one of my managers how I was feeling That I never know if I ll wake up and wish I hadn t or if I d be fine and he told me that I seemed like a relative of his with Bipolar and advised me to go to the doctors My first visit was worthless she listened to me for 15 seconds when I said I was worried I might have Bipolar she said thats for a professional to decide Hence why I came to a doctor so I could hopefully see a professional wrote me a prescription for Citalopram and sent me on my way I ended up starting to do research on various mental disorder and came across BPD and suddenly it clicked Everything made sense Why I felt the way I felt with Alice The anger outbursts at work the general mood swings at home Everything The second doctor I saw was much more friendly when I explained what I was feeling and mentioned I first thought it was bipolar she said she felt that it was unlikely to be that When I mentioned I d also been reading about EUPD and felt my symptoms were very similar to it she seemed to agree that it was much more likely to be that and offered to refer me to the local psychiatrist for evaluation diagnosis which I accepted My first psychiatrist was reluctant to give a full diagnosis based on the fact that I d only been presenting symptoms for 4 5 years and declared Rather we can say he me has strong symptoms of BPD I then saw a different psychiatrist and experimented on various different medications experiencing 90 of the negative side effects but none of the good During this time I started speaking to a girl called Shelby online and we ended up meeting really soon after as she was into motorbikes and I had one Again we d speak daily she ended up getting a boyfriend which killed me inside but he ended up cheating on her A few weeks after what I felt a good time space would be I ended up telling her how I felt about her to which her response was thats cute but kinda creepy Within 2 hours of that message I was in hospital having ingested around 2 dozen packs of pills After 38 hours and various IV drips I was declared physically fit and the hospital psychs declared me mentally ok to go home 1 2 psychiatrist appointments after that I was officially diagnosed with BPD which unlike many sufferers came as a huge relief to me I finally had the answer I wanted to why I was the way I was when my Asperger s didn t fit it Why did I care so much about having a girlfriend Why were my moods so up and down Jobs came and went as a result of my outbursts another overdose came and went after seeing the girl I fancied getting off with one of my friends I was already drunk and continued drinking took 7 packets of pain killers and the rest of my anti depressants anti psychotics Self harm came into my life Never enough to cause damage just to take away the mental pain for a moment Now here I am 21 and still a virgin Looking for more people like me to talk to who actually understand me I now have a couple of friends but the one thing I truly want above all else still eludes me I ve still never had a relationship or even a proper date I ve only ever kissed 2 girls both of whom felt sorry for me and one of whom was drunk as well Everytime I see couples happy together it kills me inside I m fairly sure having a girlfriend would make me at least 75 better I spend most nights thinking fantasizing about killing myself as I never see it getting better I never see me getting a girlfriend or being loved I never see me not wanting it or with my animal lust being tamed I never see a world without mood swings tl dr I m pretty fucked up and it aint getting better anytime soon here I am,Suicidal Reference
pardon the throwaway account Backstory about me F 23 diagnosed with bipolar II when I was about 16 and BPD about a month ago Trying to unlearn years of bipolar based self analysis I m not even sure if I buy the bpII diagnosis anymore So I ve known my best friend for almost a decade we go way back and there has always been sexual romantic tension between us We ve hooked up a couple of times over the last few years but we don t live close to each other anymore and something has always seemed off In April his brother died I had just finished school was able to really stick around and take care of him saw him every day kept him fed etc Organized a couple of nice things for him within our larger friend group Everything pretty much kosher good friend stuff So I ve always had terrible fantasies about tragedy Pretty standard stuff being raped trying to kill myself having my whole family die etc These fantasies generally focus on what happens when I tell people I m close to about these tragedies Recently they ve all been about this friend Sometimes it s just me re reading texts or imagining our interactions as they happened during the week after his brother s passing sometimes it s him being there with me after my whole family dies etc etc Point is these thoughts are incredibly frequent and always feature this friend It s uncanny actually because even before I would sometimes fantasize about horrible things happening to my friend and him really needing and relying on me I am having so much trouble coming to terms with these thoughts I know that the reason I was such a good friend to him is because I love him deeply in a million different ways and wanted to help but there are so many layers of BPD shit on top of that Now two months later I m still texting him almost every day and I know that it s more for me than for him I ve also been having a difficult summer but I ve been inflating it in my head as far far worse than it is I moved to a new town and don t know anyone and I m dealing with a lot of identity formation college graduation panic and all I want is this friend to take care of me We ve always relied on each other to deal with emotional issues and I m really feeling the loss of this support I haven t really talked to him about my problems but they feel so trivial and I know that I m being dramatic and making them seem bigger than they are I m certainly not making demands of him nor would I but I think he s getting annoyed with my texting and I don t really know how to tell either way So at any rate I m terrified that he s going to pick up on what I see as some pretty sick twisted thoughts I m getting super afraid of abandonment and constantly find myself thinking that he just must not love me as much as I love him I m quite self aware and can rationalize these feelings as parts of my disease but I don t know how to communicate this nor can I really tell if there s anything he s picking up on that I need to explain I feel like my actions during the hellish week right after his brother s death were super self indulgent and self important and that within my own head I ve just made it all about me The whole tragedy has felt like something that I handled externally so well because I was getting off on being a good friend maybe among other things Anyway I felt like I needed to share and I d love thoughts BPD is a new world to me and I don t know what s normal what s not my fault and what I need to and can control,Suicidal Reference
Long story short For the past2 or 3 weeks I ve been having mood swings that aren t really necessarily triggered by a comment someone made or whatever in my environment it just kinda happens I don t even have much stimuli or interaction in my environment to trigger it like if a friend didn t text back or something since I ve been 100 alone for those weeks Except for the people I see on the street I have no face to face interactions or any interaction for that matter with friends Anyway For 2 days I ll feel so happy and like I have so much love and good things to offer everyone I don t need much sleep and it s much easier to wake up early I paint and draw a lot I get a lot of enjoyment out of everything Then after that for 2 days I ll feel so suicidal and cut and hate myself and get 0 enjoyment from anything and sleep forever and it s so hard to wake up Then it s back to feeling great for 2 or 3 days What s up with that I thought BPD was more like there are mood swings but they come out of your environment not by itself with no provocation from the outside I feel like at least if it was because of my environment I had more concrete things to work with to make me feel better she didn t text late because she doesn t like you she texted late because she was at work dot feel bad but now I don t really have a reason for it so i just feel really confused,Suicidal Reference
Yesterday I invited my ex girlfriend round we hadn t spoken in a week The same day I actually moved into my new flat she was suppose to come round but we fell out and stopped speaking In that time she had started seeing and slept with someone new We ve been broken up for a little over two months now but had trouble keeping it just friends I thought we were going to get back together I took this new horribly started crying screaming at her to fuck off and when I excused myself to the toilet I started cutting at myself with a razor She kicks open the door and breaks down phoning me an ambulance due to a mental breakdown I get assessed no major damage done and they release me My ex was shocked I was released as I said to the woman s face I had intentions on killing myself and will most likely self harm Sorry for the rant that probably doesn t make sense I just need someone to speak to I ve fallen out with all of my friends and lost my best friend the ex is the best friend by the way I think what hurts the most about her seeing someone new is that three weeks ago she was ill and I cuddled her brought her food gave her little kisses and we swapped I love you s Two weeks ago she wouldn t stop talking about how excited she was about me getting my own place One week ago we fall out and she ends up seeing someone new,Suicidal Reference
TL DR going to see my shitty therapist in september how can i get the treatment i need After a long 2 and a half years without any professional help I m finally getting back into the system The only problem is is that I m going back to the same psychologist I had when I was a teenager 13 17 And I really didn t find him empathetic and his accent was hard to understand I don t even know if he knows anything on BPD because he would always tell me to just obey my mother get a job etc He thought that getting a 9 5 job would fix everything Well it didn t I had a mental breakdown 4 days in and got fired And I haven t had the confidence to find a job since And I haven t seen him since then So I have some questions How can I list off what my problems are without sounding like I did most of my research my self I am officially diagnosed I was 15 because him and my GP hate when I sound like I just read it on the internet I need to bring up narcisstic parents sexual abuse dissociation rollercoaster of emotions black and white thinking eg Nothing can stop me Vs I wanna die Compulsive skin picking DBT Mindfulness,Suicidal Reference
Hey guys I ve been posting a lot lately because there s been a bit of a shitstorm around me My stress levels are through the roof to the point where I m experiencing health problems ulcers muscle spasms etc that are mostly psychosomatic responses to the skewed emotional perceptions of BPD I ve handled it moderately well up to this point Today however my work life got as stressful as my home life and I m slipping I m good for now I m focusing on the things that make me happy but I m starting to have some dark thoughts creep in I m starting to feel like death is the only way I ll ever be free of this Fortunately I ve been doing this a while now and I know that it s time to talk to someone instead of continue listening and spiraling Basically I m feeling weak and I m not sure I have the mental fortitude to keep this up and I m scared of what will happen if I completely lose it and fall into a BPD driven rage where I destroy all my relationships I don t want to look up once I start feeling level again and realize I m alone because I alienated all my friends and family What do you guys do to prevent that from happening What do you do when focusing on the good doesn t quite cancel out the stress fear and BPD rage that builds,Suicidal Reference

I ve been bad Lower than I ve been in a long while I feel like I m a vessel with a hole in the bottom I have to have a constant incoming stream to keep me filled A little neglect and I m empty again No water to hold closed the doors in my brain that hold back the bad things Circumstances are not great Don t want to delve into specifics but I feel like I ve made a lifetime of decisions based on what I was feeling in the moment and hindsight is a bitch I worry that I ve killed the good things in my life because I can t differentiate between the stream slowing down and the stream stopping When I feel empty I am sure that no one loves me anymore And normal people just don t need the level of stimulus I do What if I ve burned bridges I never should have because I blamed them for my empty feelings I ve been feeling suicidal for the first time since I was a teen I feel like I ve failed and there is no future I feel like I will always be haunted by my pain and fear and guilt I feel alone All alone and whimpering into the darkness Also started a new job and finding it extremely difficult to cope Back in my hometown The one I fled from Working in constant fear of seeing people I used to know I don t know how to keep going forward when every second feels like their are ants crawling through my veins,Suicidal Reference

I have had BPD for a while now I was diagnosed in October and since then it has been an uphill battle managing my anxiety depression and anger I have come a really long way and things have gotten better I felt like life was finally going to be what i wanted and not just one big random mood swing waiting to happen Now for every step that i made forward in the right direction now I m back at square one This fucking disease Lupus or whatever this awful shit is is killing me I dont mean literally yet but how much can one person really deal with havent i been through enough why now Why when things where going so good I dont get it and i dont think i ever will everything is irritating me to high hell My poor babies i cant even imagine they had me for such a brief moment and it was good and now i can barely take care of them Im yelling a lot again and threatening them even though i cant beat them because i can barely use my hands I just sit here over 3 weeks after i got really sick with my first flare and ask my self why do i even bother What use do i have to society my husband and my kids if i cant even be that with out something in the way I want to die even though i know it wont solve anything but to ease my own pain I hate my self and everything about me for being a defect and a burden to all those around me I just think how much easier everyone s life would be without me here They wouldnt have to worry what next my son wouldnt have to ask me if im going to be sick tomorrow or next week My husband wouldnt have to wonder if after working all day how much work hes going to have to do when he gets home because i cant do anything I try to push through it but im tired and i just want to sleep and never wake up and i dont even have anyone to talk to about no one that really understand the pain in my heart that never goes away The pain of always being a failure,Suicidal Reference
All of this happened earlier this week I know it s really really long but I m trying to trim it as best as I can Please bear with me I have quiet borderline and I ve grown into a very self aware person over time despite having mood swings irritability fears of abandonment etc I went from being someone who self harmed constantly had meltdowns and self destructed on a regular basis to someone who is mostly contained on the outside aside from impulsiveness and irritability I still struggle with it inwardly to its full intensity but I ve made great strides in trying to be considerate and control my outward emotions For a little bit of background my relationship with my boyfriend started relatively awkwardly We are both often debilitatingly mentally ill and despite starting to feel like I was in love with him I went to great effort to try to convince him that I was not relationship material In short I m terrified of being close to people and I tend towards distancing myself by pushing them away but in time he convinced me that we would work fine together because we were mature enough to meet each others emotional needs In time I became extremely confident in our relationship There were a few hiccups here and there and naturally we had our moments of weakness but most things went swimmingly and it was the most stable relationship I ve ever been in Except earlier this week I completely lost it We d run into an issue a few weeks prior where there was serious talk from him of ending our relationship over what felt on my end to be a relatively small argument I ve always known him to be a very cut and dry kind of person and I ve always feared he would drop me if I stepped over some sort of boundary but I had become less and less worried as time went on I tried hard to pretend it was just a misstep on both of our parts but we were both obviously on our toes around each other Earlier this week I went to my sister s and got a haircut that I didn t like I took a picture of myself and sent it to my boyfriend telling him I don t like it He messages me I think you always look cute So I repeated I don t like it I think it s ugly I think he sensed my irritation and tried to diffuse it by making a joke but I became increasingly touchy to the point of outright telling him to shut up He became upset and basically told me You re not acting like yourself so I m going to ignore you until this changes and I freaked out Immediately I regressed into being how I was when I was sixteen and started hurling insults He told me he just wanted me to act respectful to him he told me he could not believe I was acting like this even knowing that I have borderline You re making fun of me stop fucking making fun of me I don t want to sit here and listen to you tell me this is all my fault Why can t I just take five minutes to be pissed off at you I get it everything is my fault I felt completely out of control and it got worse I get it no one wants to handle me I m not cut out for relationships Why don t you just leave me already Leave before you start to hate me I can t take it the whole nine yards He says This is the most borderline I ve ever seen you behave so I ll give you the benefit of some time to recover I still love you but I can t stand this for obvious reasons Come back when you ve thought about this for a day or so If you think the same then we ll break up because that seems to be what you want anyway Otherwise we ll patch things up as usual but I keep going I hate you I never want to talk to you again You made me feel like I could be in a relationship you knew what you were getting into He said I was bleeding out and that I was trying to take me with him I just didn t want you to make fun of me I just wanted you to stop Fucking great I m going to lose my relationship with you over a fucking haircut I understand you don t want me stop toying with me and just leave me already Etc As my tantrum hits his peak he messages me I m done with you Don t contact me again and removes me from Skype Immediately I grab my phone and call him and for some reason he picks up but he says Why are you calling me It s over I fall into complete hysterics and I keep repeating I m sorry I didn t mean to I didn t mean to please don t leave me please please please My entire world is falling to pieces I m crying so hard that it s impossible to understand me and I can t even hear what he s saying on the other line His tone is cold and unforgiving and I m hearing a lot of this isn t going to work out and I don t want to put up with you He calls me a land mine it hurts so badly and he says he s been growing disinterested in our relationship for weeks He s sick of feeling like he has to walk on eggshells around me A lot of stuff is coming up that I ve never even been told about I keep insisting that I didn t know you didn t tell me I could ve fixed this why didn t you tell me He concedes and we re on this phone call for an hour with me out of my mind until he tells me he s going to give me a week to fix this and then hangs up A few hours later I call him to check in on him and when he answers he s like Yeah I thought about this and it s not going to work out At this point I m completely shell shocked and I go what what you said you d give me a week what are you talking about He s telling me all of the same things that he said in the last call and I m trying so hard not to entirely lose my shit again but I try to placate him by telling him a bunch of lies that this will NEVER happen again and I ll be on my best behavior forever and I ll be the best girlfriend he s ever had He goes back to giving me that week and goes to sleep Fuck I can t sleep and so I go through some Skype logs and I find an exchange from the day before where we re having this same exact conversation but it s going entirely differently It was almost prophetic I m afraid I m going to do something and it s going to upset you I know you re going to get fed up with me and leave me No honey that s not going to happen I don t always know how to handle you at your worst but most of the time you re great I love you I m completely hurt but I send it to him like What do you think of this The next day comes and I call him nervously and we talk for probably five minutes I tell him that I love him and he doesn t say anything back to me before ending the call I text him why didn t you say that you love me too Because I don t right now I scheduled an emergency doctor s appointment to get some anti psychotics so I didn t lose my mind and kill myself In between the doctor s appointment and picking up the prescription there had been another phone call I d started to say that he wasn t putting me in a good position with what happened three weeks ago and he AGAIN went back to This isn t going to work I don t care that you re upset with me what a good way to get someone s forgiveness putting all of the blame on them All those things I d said the other day were lies I felt like I had to tell you all of that shit in that Skype log none of it was true There s a lot of you ruined everything and I don t love you anymore vibes and I m back to begging and whatnot and he eventually tells me that he s going to take thirty minutes to be on his own and think about everything I m sitting in my car in the drugstore line and I m really worried Even if this works out I think it s irreparable as a whole at this point I return with my prescription and he calls me and he says Hey so I did some thinking and there s a lot I have to apologize to you for I m completely floored He had written down a list of things I m sorry I hid what I was thinking I jumped the gun and assumed we were done permanently so I kept being nasty and detached with you I should ve expressed my love more I gave up on you and should ve trusted that you re going to get even better I shouldn t have threatened to leave you two weeks ago I don t have good insight into my own emotions I was hurt and scared and acted rashly and unfairly and understand that I m going to have to take more time to build your trust Um okay I m kind of speechless but I forgive him This next week is just awful I m so exhausted and on edge and while he s made plenty of attempts to reassure me that this isn t going to happen again he knows how to handle me now he really does love me I m sorry I said those things I forgot what we had etc I want to trust him but I just can t I ve had another meltdown just two days ago over family situations worse even than the first one but he seemed fine and helped me through it I want to believe him so bad but everything he said to me has been ringing around in my head I don t know why I dated you I doubted this from the start I don t want to date someone with borderline I haven t been able to express everything that happened during this week because I don t want to write a longer novel than I have but I ve never felt more insecure with him He s already turned around and been so mindful this week and I think hope that we re going to work things out We ve agreed that SO MANY of our issues have been the summer and that when I come back to school this next semester everything will be so much better but I m not sure I didn t put him on a pedestal but I didn t even know anything was wrong I didn t expect this at all from him All of this intense precariousness OUTSIDE OF ME is fucking with my head Every time I think back to it I find something else about it to fixate on It s obviously hurting him and I really want to believe him but it s so hard to resist the urge to come full circle and dump him because I m not capable of handling a relationship I don t know what to believe Any time he says anything to me I think He could be lying about this like he did before What should I do I m so scared I love him so much and I was so so unbelievably happy with him before all of this happened and I want to be that happy again I don t want to doom this when it might turn out well for us but my abandonment fears have reached their peak I feel like it s all my fault I m going to be fucked up for the next month over this TL DR My boyfriend and I got into a massive fight as a result of a meltdown that I had and he broke up with me several times in a short time frame He eventually came around and apologized about everything but I don t know if I can trust him anymore I think he s capable of changing but I don t think I m going to be able to move on from this for awhile I don t want to act too rashly Trying to be okay with this and also life,Suicidal Reference
The quotes is in reference to the song Dead Skin by Crossfade I think I m done I have an amazing wife adorable daughter and I m probably going to lose them I ve seen countless posts here on relationship problems successes and failures It s getting close to time for another Hopefully not the latter I have problems like many of us And while I m sure there are plenty of people out there experiencing the same thing I can t help but feel alone and lost I cheated on my wife in the form of somewhat graffic instant messages between myself and an ex And I know it was wrong How it went from her and I catching up to that I have no idea My actions and methods of existence walk the line of emotionally abusive and there is no secret that my wife is completely indifferent to my existence at this point I wake up with the best of intentions and hope of it being a better day but it seems like it s only a matter of time before the fighting starts But my arguing makes little to no sense I deflect dodge spin every subject like I m a lobbyist or shady Defense attorney And when I feel boxed in which usually happens fairly quickly I lash out like a feral dog that s been kicked or poked to many times She s saying I have a month to make a change but I don t see it happening Not for lack of wanting but the inability to exist anywhere but the moment or the depressing theoretical future I want nothing more than that romantic comedy style marriage The relationship where even the bad times lead to love laughter and growth But my conscious awareness of what I m doing and saying holds no merit I can t seem to think about what I m doing or saying I m afraid that at the end of the month which ends the day after my birthday of all fucking days will mark the failure of the most consistent thing in my life And I can t do it I can t continue to live where I live alone It can t be done Minimum wage is not a living wage Meaning I ll have to move back to my home state meaning a 24 hour drive one way nonstop Which will certainly kill whatever is left alive in me at this point But I can t help but think they will be better off without me They both deserve a love and compassion that I can t seem to offer So at this point I m hoping for the best and for once I m not planning for the worst Reason being there is no way to plan I just hope some switch flips over or some random neurons start working like they should Otherwise I m afraid that the only remaining ounces of good within me are doomed I don t see a future without them that leads to anywhere but bloodshed violence and an abrupt spiral back into alcoholism And maybe that s what s needed Maybe I m suppose to be this living embodiment of damaged chaos under a controlled exterior Who knows But right now this is just me venting Purging the system in a way As with almost all my posts here I ll delete it in a day or two Why That s just how I do things No reason other than that Side note that s song I mentioned earlier is about how I feel right now,Suicidal Reference

Man fuck you Now I have to sit here and worry about losing another close friend cause I tried to be open about my self harm At least that s what I think it is I tried to ask questions and show pictures because I was feeling insecure about it and I thought I could get a legit answer from her but I got shit I got yelled at I guess it doesn t help that she s fucking pregnant and hormone riddled So great I probably fucking ruined another friendship She won t fucking text me back and I have to sit here and have all the willpower in the world to not pick up the phone and call and flip out or to run to my closet and grab a knife and start cutting Fuck people man Fuck them I fucking hate opening up to people,Suicidal Reference
Hello My friend has been hospitalized now for two weeks and diagnosed with BPD She recently broke up with her partner It was an intense and short relationship She now feels like her partner never cared that he lied to her and that she was used She was harming herself and considering suicide which is why she went to the hospital I visit her almost every day and took her out on a 4 hour assisted day pass yesterday to see Inside Out and get lunch I ve done grounding exercises with her and brought her a unicorn with different textures to ground herself when she dissociates I m trying my best to support her but I don t know how to respond to her anymore She is obsessing about whether or not they can ever be together again and I tell her that she needs to stay in the present and focus on getting well again I remind her that lots of people love her and won t leave her including me What kind of things are good to hear when you re feeling so raw,Suicidal Reference

I was in a huge argument with my SO today We are just so different and seem to clash so often We can both be so mean he doesn t respect me and I don t respect him There is so much more to the story but I m so exhausted My BPD causes me to hate him so passionately then hate myself I can t turn my anger and frustration on others so I turn it on myself I ve been self harming just now and I feel so utterly alone I feel like his life would be so much better off without me here I hate life I hate myself I fuck so much up and have so much trouble fixing it And I feel like not a soul in the world knows who I am or why I act this way I don t trust anyone not a single person I can only connect superficially Sometimes I don t want to connect at all I can t stand the pain I m so tired of it all I m so fucking tired I just want the strength to end my life I am a waste I want it to be over,Suicidal Reference
Having a major relapse I started out this summer pretty okay I quit my job at the life sucking school district and went to my summer job working at a camp that I love The people I m working with are great the campers are great and I can tell this is going to be a good summer Except The problem is that camp is that camp is full of memories of HER The one I lost The one who quit me because I was a bully An asshole And the whole time I thought I was being her friend Her sister I loved her She quit me because she couldn t take it anymore She quit me because I represented someone who made her feel awful not supported And I thought I was okay I thought I had gotten over this I thought I had become stronger I gathered the courage to send her a message A picture Something that said Look I ve changed Something that I thought was an inside joke between us was just a hurtful asshole thing was inscribed on the wall That same inside joke that made her quit me I changed it I changed it and I sent her a picture I knew she wouldn t respond But I was okay with that Until Until my husband started talking about the mistakes I make and how I never learn and brought her up And when I told him that I contacted her he got mad at me Said I shouldn t have done that Said I should have left her alone I cried I bawled and I pulled out some of my hair and I tried to jump out of a moving vehicle I calmed myself down we went to dinner but now there s a cloud of hate for self hanging over me I thought I could handle it What do I do Or maybe I just need support Husband amp parents are freaked out,Suicidal Reference
