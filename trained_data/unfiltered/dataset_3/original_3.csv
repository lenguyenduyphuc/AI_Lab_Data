Hello fellow friends üòÑ I m on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged silent borderline characteristics There are different levels to experiencing anger I was wondering what are yours And how do you express it What s a healthy way you found to cool it down For me I will first become silent and blame myself maybe if I or If I only maybe he s just not having it today maybe I simply don t get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding However I find it interesting how when someone hurts the ones I love I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do but rather the aggressor In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger I don t know whether you guys get to experience this as well I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like The maximum amount of rage it s like I blackout I call it cold rage No sense of pain whatsoever pure anger It s the point people don t recognize me anymore because I will dissociate in anger My field of view will become a pinpoint I will start breathing superficially and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me It s disgusting and the insanity itself I must say this only happened once in my life when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life He didn t even let us know what had happened my sister just came home in that state Then he called her and told her she s completely bonkers instead of alarming the rest of the family I m shaking as I m writing this because I know it s still the rest of anger inside me left behind It was the first time I thought I could end someone s life I m extremely grateful for the fact that I didn t but I know I shouldn t see him anywhere ever again I try to calm myself by saying he s using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn t get it due to development delay But more often than not these calming thoughts don t work He has very narcissistic tendencies And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement I do get therapy now though So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again I guess not To put things in perspective Normally I m a shy and polite person I never insult others because I hate hurting them People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should stand up for myself more So yeah to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with There are different levels to experiencing anger I was wondering what are yours And how do you express it What s a healthy way you found to cool it down,Attacking Behavior
Okay I Äôm about to open up about many things I Äôve done in my past that I Äôm not proud of I Äôm not that person anymore In these stories I was 17 and immature as fuck I Äôm now 22 with a total different take on life I became best friends with this girl in 2017 We were both 17 at the time We did everything together We smoked weed daily Sleepovers Longboard together Did acid together We did everything together We would die for each other Once we robbed our mutual friends house We stole 200 from the girls dad I ended up telling the girl and paid her back Bc I felt bad Once we robbed a building and made out with 1 500 and never got caught Once we robbed a house we thought was someone we knew who just robbed us Turned out it was a fake address he gave us and we robbed a random house We never got caught Once we got arrested for robbing cars off acid while drunk We caught some fines for that We did a lot of sneaky bad shit together After the last time we got caught we stopped doing all that shit We were doing really well Long story short this is how our friendship ended áÔ è I was dating a super toxic dude and she Äôd tell me to leave him all the time Finally I left him We went to a party and had a fucking blast The next day I went home and sent her this whole long text about how her and her bf were toxic and that they should break up She didn Äôt take that lightly I don Äôt blame her I wasn Äôt nice about it and it came out of no where We were literally fine the day before I ended up switching schools and she started rumors that I wanted to break them up because I wanted her boyfriend and he told everyone I tried to kiss him Not true He didn Äôt like me because she spent more time with me than him and he voiced that all the time Then I got with my current boyfriend HERE IT IS I got my boyfriend to rob her house I specifically said he could only take weed related things No money and can Äôt steal from her mom So he took two bongs and 8gs of weed She assumed it was me right away Bc who else knew her window didn Äôt shut I finally admitted to her like 5 6 months later during our graduation When I told her it looked like she wanted to kill me but she kept her cool on the outside Let Äôs call my best friend that I had my bf rob Katrina Let Äôs call the girl Katrina and I robbed 200 from her parents Yazra Yazra wasn Äôt mad at Katrina or Me for robbing her parents She accepted out apology Yazra invited me and Katrina to her graduation party We both show up and there I gave Katrina 300 to make up for what I had robbed She didn Äôt seem happy I don Äôt blame her It Äôs been 5ish years since 2017 when we were best friends We are friends on Facebook but we don Äôt talk Last week I shared a post that says Äúif you were ever my closet friend at one point just know I think about you from time to time and hope you Äôre doing great things in life Äù and she heart reacted my post 4 days ago I saw her at the liquor store She was right behind me in line I was consumed in anxiety and couldn Äôt even bring myself to say hi or even look at her When we first saw each other we both looked shook and then quickly looked walked away She also said nothing I really really want to be her friend again I cry over her all the time I vent about her in my journals I write letters that I think I would one day send to her but never do Do you think she forgave me Do you think she misses me Do you think she could give me a chance again Do you think she Äôs even capable of trusting me again Don Äôt you think she could forgive me after everything we did to other people Do you think I should try to message her I apologized 100 times back in 2018 during graduation and at the graduation party and repaid her What should I say if I do message her I really don Äôt want to never message her and move on from her She Äôs really special to me I love her a lot She was the best friend I ever had besides all the bad stuff we did I know we are both grown up now and we wouldn Äôt do any more stupid reckless shit if we were friends again Help I Äôm a wreck,Attacking Behavior
not trying to play the complete victim here but i feel as though my childhood trauma and pain molded me into what and who i am today my mother is a narcissist but unaware that she is because she Äôs old school my father is deadbeat i have both mommy and daddy issues because of this i never really knew how to keep relationships growing up i Äôd stay in toxic unhealthy relationships to the point where now i have ptsd and bad anxiety attacks as time went on my ptsd grew more and the anxiety attacks also being cheated on ghosted humiliated played a big part BUT now one thing i Äôve realized about myself is that i Äôm starting to pick up this behavior where i am getting into relationships amp whenever someone cheats on me or hurts me i play victim whole time i cheated first or and cheating just like them except i play the victim and act like as if i Äôm not doing anything wrong when the person ends up leaving and coming back to apologize i hold the grudge over their head hoping it Äôll hurt them into thinking their karma is coming for them for how they treated me when whole time i Äôm mirroring what they are doing to me without them knowing i stay in this victim mentality and don Äôt break out of character i Äôll cry and cry and cry but deep down i know im not the victim but they Äôll never know that you know a lot of people have thought their karma was because of me maybe it was or maybe it wasn Äôt is it so wrong to play victim though i need answers,Attacking Behavior
I always self sabotage my relationships and sometimes it makes me wonder if I Äôll ever actually have a long term relationship longer than my 3 year one In which was miserable and I trauma bonded with him I constantly want the feelings of the dating for the first few weeks it Äôs so exciting and the thrill gets me everytime The man I Äôm with now I love dearly however he Äôs toxic and I know I am too I admit I would pick fights but he would start them to for no reason call me crazy tell me I need to get help and that I Äôm nuts and my brain is Äú fucked Äú in his words I know I don Äôt deserve that I Äôve apologized every single time I Äôve been rude or mean to him yet he never apologizes and blames it all on me I think I crave the new relationship feeling because there Äôs a point when you become comfortable with someone and if I just keep that feeling and different people I won Äôt ever have to keep going through this again I feel really lonely right now I don Äôt have any friends My FP is my mom She Äôs surely sick of hearing me I just want a friend,Attacking Behavior
My long time friend came over to visit for two weeks and we got into a big argument because I tell myself that he doesn t care about me and that I might as well fuck everything up now since I know I m going to fuck it all up later He left to his uncles house which is understandable but at the same time I wanted him back because I don t actually want to be alone and I couldn t stop crying I got really upset and sent his girlfriend a sex video of us and told her he likes to have her on the phone while having sex with other people which is true and I know it s out of line for me to do that but in my head at the moment I just thought I m not seeing him again anyway so I m going to extra fuck everything up Now I can t stop crying because I know I really fucked up now but at the same time I wasn t going to see him again anyway I don t know what to do He s hurt me a lot in the past too but I don t want to make excuses I didn t want to feel abandoned again and I knew it would happen so I self sabotaged and now I m like why the fuck did I DO THAT I know this post is all over the place but I really can t think straight right now Let me know if I need to clarify something or something like that I just want to calm down and move on and stop thinking about it I knew it was going to happen anyway so I shouldn t be feeling like this,Attacking Behavior
I feel like I can t see clearly and I don t know if I m in the wrong or not anymore Yesterday my husband and I got in an argument I feel like I don t get any time for myself we have an 8 month old and a dog that just had major surgery My husband is off work with an injury for the last 4 months I was up with our son at 6am Got him ready for the day let out the chickens come back in and made pancakes for everyone When breakfast was ready he said didn t feel good injury I assume and took his breakfast out on the deck and smoked a joint its around 8am by now This was a bit upsetting to me as I thought we would have breakfast together and why is he smoking weed so early I don t know I was a bit sulky He stayed out there for about an hour then came in to start his physio For whatever reason this took until 2pm or later I was gradually getting more upset and feeling more and more like my time doesn t matter and I m just expected to be the one that takes care of the baby makes the meals cleans the house etc These have been ongoing feelings for me since our son was born I am the one getting up throughout the night and in the mornings I put him to bed and feed him his meals and give him baths and get him dressed I feel like I m not asking a lot to have a couple of hours to myself once in a while Around 4 kiddo had a nap so I went to get some gardening done Finally This argument isn t over though we don t talk for the rest of the night He watches the baby for an hour when he wakes from nap 6 30 rolls around and I come in to get our son feed him dinner and get him in bed for 8 30 I go straight to bed as well This morning I woke up at 6 Husband is already up Try to go into kitchen to get coffee going going breakfast for our kid He shoves me and tells me to fuck off Told him I have to get breakfast for our son and he picks up a box of baby food pouches and throws them at me after this I take our son and go into the bedroom and lock the door I was in an extremely abusive relationship in my early 20s and this behaviour scares me He starts blasting really aggressive music and said if I turn it off he will end me All of this seems like a completely irrational and aggressive reaction to a pretty normal argument for new parents to have He then told me he pulled wires under the hood of the car so I can t leave I wasn t trying to but this is also scary for me We only have one vehicle currently and live rurally The music is still blasting I m hiding in the bedroom trying to keep it together Music is blasting for about 2hrs while he does his physio Then before he leaves he bangs on the door until I open it since he would just come in through the door that goes onto the deck if I didn t He says some incredibly hurtful things like that I deserved to be abused by my ex he fractured my skull and almost killed me and that I am exactly like my mother who I have been estranged from since I was 12 Then he said he definitely didn t piss on my toothbrush Needless to say I have thrown it out Then he takes the car and leaves I want to tell you I have definitely caused my fair share of problems in the history of our relationship I have CPTSD depression and of course BPD I am on medication and have gone to therapy and have come a long way in the last 6 years My question is did I cause this Did I bring this upon our marriage and upon my beautiful son with things I have done in the past Am I not understanding that I hurt him somehow the day before by being upset Will I be cursed to not trusting my own feelings forever,Attacking Behavior
Hello I just learned that I have BPD I always knew something was wrong with me I Äôve failed at everything Relationships careers the military Ä I thought my discharge would be a new healthy start Ä I Äôve been dating my Äúgf Äù on and off for over a year now At the beginning we fought because I always felt like she was hiding something amp it would turn into huge fights where she would be upset because I don Äôt trust her Well long story short I ended up finding out that she didn Äôt disclose a STD about 6 months ago by finding a medication bottle in her apartment and I ended up ghosting her for 3 months because the feelings of betrayal were so strong Ä If she would Äôve just told me I would Äôve accepted her Ä but she made me feel crazy Ä She lied to my face amp she was still trying to force me to stay in the relationship I had to go Ä I ended up wanting to reconcile things after I took time apart but ever since she Äôs been holding me leaving over my head amp I know ghosting is wrong but I felt like she wasn Äôt respecting my space and pain For the past 4 months she Äôs been holding me at arms length because she Äôs still hurt about how i left her amp the ensuing rages i go into don Äôt help I throw things and get verbally abusive It Äôs terrible and i hate myself every time i do it When I get angry I just want her to admit how messed up it was to gaslight me whenever i used to tell her i had trust issues and i felt like she was hiding something That really hurt me to the core She did eventually apologize and i said i forgave her and i thought i did but it is proving so difficult I Äôm so hurt still but i love her beyond her flaws And it doesn Äôt help that i feel like she doesn Äôt treat me like she did before I may be selfish for this but i don Äôt think it Äôs fair that she gets to treat me like I Äôm the reason the whole relationship tanked and even though we are actively working on trying to fix things her distance makes me feel so insecure and I Äôm not someone worth committing 100 to I had been having episodes almost daily trying to get through to her amp tell her how i think it Äôs unfair how quickly i let her back in but she can Äôt do the same for me It makes me feel like crap I stopped drinking because the rages kept becoming worse and she said i was making the relationship toxic Problem is I Äôm still having episodes because I still feel angry for what she did amp she blames me for leaving saying i abandoned her but I still came back and am trying to love her despite everything When i talk about my feelings it quickly becomes an argument because she says we can Äôt move forward because of all the resentment i harbor The moment she begins to raise her voice i fly into a rage and this last time i think i crossed the line and said some really terrible things i wish i could take back Ä She say I Äôve been abusive since i met her and I Äôm finding it hard to live with that Yeah she has done her dirt but i think i took it too far last night Ä I feel as evil as my mother We are going on a trip tomorrow that we had originally planned to take to bring us back together but after last night i think I Äôm going to tell her goodbye amp do things on my own while we are abroad I feel bad for making her feel like crap and always bringing up the past but I Äôm so angry She knew my past but that doesn Äôt excuse the way i have been treating her and now i feel like a monster who can never forgive and will hurt everyone i come across I get so verbally abusive and reading back on the messages i feel like a very dangerous person amp I feel like i don Äôt deserve a relationship because they all end so turbeulent But she was the first one i actually felt like i fell deeply in love with and vice versa My trust isn Äôt completely ruined after this but piece of me feel like i deserve it from a lot of shit that happened in my past Idk what I Äôm asking here but I Äôm packing and trying to prevent myself from spiraling out of control I guess i needed to vent I don Äôt really talk to my family and don Äôt have many Äúclose Äù friends who would understand and i don Äôt want to disclose information about her health status to them She was my best friend but I can hear it in her voice that she Äôs over me I think this was the last straw She said if i actually love her i would be patient with her healing process but i feel like I Äôve never gotten that from her myself so i lash out I guess I Äôm seeking help in with coping with the fact that i think I Äôm meant to be alone amp finally letting her go I said terrible things amp i can Äôt believe I Äôm that type of person Ä I feel so low Ä and i guess i just needed to get out a feeling that feel is like is about to make me implode inside at any min I can at least say this helps a bit Thank you for reading,Attacking Behavior
I Äôve really thought about this for a while now as my therapist and my sister have both said this to me I know I Äôm strong I Äôve been strong all my life I got through so much shit alone all my life And I don Äôt wanna be strong anymore I don Äôt wanna put on my big girl pants and get up and get going I wanna scream and cry and yell and fight I wanna create a goddamn storm I Äôm tired of being strong all the damn time I Äôm tired of being a rock in the emotional turmoil that has been my life Lately I Äôve been feeling like I Äôm holding my shit together by a fucking string and I Äôm afraid to let the shit go cause I thought letting go was gonna be the end of me but no I don Äôt think so anymore I Äôm unleashing this fucking storm bro Also I Äôm sooo tired of people calling me fucking dramatic for having intense emotions Fuck you you Äôre so boring You have no personality You live your life like the basic office people in the backgrounds of movies No real lines no personality you do nothing but wake up work eat sleep and do it all again the next day Just a gray character You Äôre an extra and bitch I Äôm the main character ü Äç ôÄÔ è,Attacking Behavior
Hi this is may be deleted at one point but I Äôm not sure when I am not yet diagnosed with borderline but I Äôm almost 100 I have it And it Äôs killing me It has been killing me all my life It has affected my friends my loved ones and myself But you probably already know that What Äôs concerning me right now is whether or not I can feel love Right now my girlfriend and I are on a one week break from one another I Äôve been what I fee is an emotionally abusive asshole towards her Paranoid that she would cheat on me that she would leave me And before that ever little thing I didn Äôt like that she did set me off When it shouldn Äôt have and I know it shouldn Äôt have But it did anyways And it always hurt me later to think about it My question is can borderlines feel love I feel like I Äôve been such a manipulative piece of crap to her and I just want to know if there Äôs even any hope I don Äôt want to hurt her heart she means so much to me but I Äôve been such a douche to her I stared self reflecting so much asking why I even love her If I even do I cried so much thinking about her gone The thought of not seeing her Her smile gone her heart to someone else She can do as she pleases but it hurts me Do I love what she Äôs done for me or her as a person How can I even tell Is she better off without me Can I fix us Maybe I Äôm overthinking I Äôm just so lost right now and would like some experiences and thoughts and advice even It hurts my chest and makes me cry and I Äôm desperate,Attacking Behavior
No you don t you hated me and used me You listen to my tirade and listen well Justin I don t want you to speak once until my rant is over You know why the call the poor and mentally ill invisible people it s because you re not supposed to see us digging in trash cans and restaurant dumpsters at 3 00 am for our dinner because we spent inside all day Those who lack object permanence make up their own versions of what happens and what people believe or do No one cared about my side of the story so I don t have one anymore I ll save my last for you I do have a bit to say I have had half a year to think and I have things to get off my chest There Äôs no other way I can go about this in good conscience I Äôve wanted to say a lot of things to you since our falling out last year none of which were diplomatic to say the least Expect a few paragraphs It really comes down to letting my bruised ego take over when I found out I was going to be kicked out in July August becoming something that I wasn Äôt and going full Joker mode when I started thinking about what it would be like to spend another year on the street One thing I need to apologize for before the insults is not being my genuine self I didn Äôt want to tell you I wasn Äôt comfortable sharing my twin size bed with you I didn Äôt want to tell you I wasn Äôt attracted to you and our sexual encounters were just that for me it Äôs just cool to have sex with a bisexual person ever since I came out as bi We really don Äôt have enough in common to be compatible and I think you know that we Äôre opposites in a lot of ways I Äôm a metalhead you listen to mostly pop from what I remember I Äôm a light sleeper you sleep heavily I don Äôt like multiplayer games that much and you Äôre too tall for us to have a proper physical intimacy This isn Äôt about that however There are alot of things we both like but there are just as many things we have to agree to disagree upon I looked up to you for your cooking and intelligence and tended to look down on you for the things you were interested in but since you never asked follow up questions about my interests I unfortunately never felt compelled to follow up with you Opposites do not attract all relationships especially friendships are built on a fair amount of common ground and we didn t spend enough time acknowledging the things we both like I have set aside my play through of Legend of Dragoon for that reason cause I know you wanna watch me play it despite me really liking that game so far A lack of communication is the one thing that does cause distance to grow between people and I felt it was just as much on my end as it was yours Most of your banter was just making fun of me and it wasn Äôt as playful as you thought it was You need to work on listening as much as I do if not more and I Äôm not gonna let you gaslight me into thinking I haven Äôt changed for the better in the last couple years I don Äôt get away with blaming memory loss so you shouldn t either Most of my frustration with you and Maddie boils down to being held to ridiculous double standards something I Äôm more than familiar with I Äôm not in denial about my issues I Äôm not a hypocrite I believe you two are in that respect I can detect when I Äôm being judged as if both of you held superiority complexes No one likes being looked down on in the social sense even if you two can t help it in the literal sense Yeah another tall remark for you Unfortunately as time passed my insecurity is what stoked the flames of my porn addiction and why I treated you less than ideally I did feel used when you stopped listening to me just as much as I used you and you were smart enough to detect that I apologize for being so selfish and ungrateful for everything you did for me last year you could have just as easily refused my invitation to reunite I owed a debt to Maddie for getting us back in touch which is why I didn Äôt feel irritated watching her frisky cats that nearly scratched up my PC screen multiple times I m also a cat fag so that might have something to do with it What I meant when I said I lost my identity is I forgot how to take care of myself and part of that is embracing the autism that passionate creative streak I always had that I thought I lost forever in back in early 2020 when the suitcase all of the fiction I had ever wrote as a teenager disappeared from the parking garage and you left the drag during the pandemic so I ruined my mind by getting deep into drugs and awful sex with the 30 year old infant Cray Cray Cristine until she got another war vet junkie to nearly gauge my eye out only to curb stomp my face in instead and fracture my cheekbone Look man The reason I didn Äôt appreciate being called a hypocrite when I harshly criticized Maddie Äôs codependency is because I wasn Äôt seeking that kind of romantic validation in 2021 In the spring of 2021 the reason why I was able to even get on Maddie Äôs good side was because my mental health dramatically improved once I was watching Vtubers and not spending a single penny on them and that Äôs what got me out of my depression and off the meth crack alcohol cigarettes last year As for media escapism I like the content I consume and porn is the only guilty pleasure I have Wish I could finish the 100s of games I play and the comics I own a lot quicker the horny is such a distraction I won Äôt deny I was and am still lonely sexually or otherwise I know what my problems are and I Äôm self aware enough to recognize my flaws and other Äôs That doesn Äôt give me the right to point the finger and obviously my reprimanding of Maddie was in no way constructive and ended up being just as abusive as what she was already going through Of course I had feelings for her I think about everyone Sure I Äôm always horny since I was 12 and yeah my dick gets in the way of my friendships but deep down I just didn Äôt want Maddie to get maimed by her ex cause I do care deeply about people even if I have a weird way of showing it I Äôm ready to move on when you are and thanks for being the best friend I Äôve ever had I completely understand if Maddie doesn Äôt want to talk to me anymore and that Äôs for the best The two things I Äôm most insecure about how I look and my intelligence and when Maddie misgendered me with an emphasized passive aggressive ÄúSIR Äù when she knew I Äôm Non Binary and called me ÄúSO DUMB Äù I was so hurt I had a very public tantrum I guess that was the consequence of me unleashing my frustrations onto her I rolled everything she and you said over in my head until I was miserable It Äôs only very recently that I Äôve been working on projects that I have a different perspective It s clich to say but you haven t changed or moved on You re the same asshole when I m trying to work on myself I wish you were not so close minded still I liked you but you made too many assumptions and thought you knew everything even going as far as incorrectly completing my sentences for me constantly Humbling myself has given me peace The things I said to both you were completely unwarranted especially with Maddie Äôs situation it wasn t my place I only know what She and Ellie have told me about her relationships Maddie Äôs a good person just stressed out Most of us are I just want to spend the rest of my life enjoying the time and friends I have Life Äôs too short to sink into these patterns of behavior I Äôve been diagnosed with BPD and I know the attachment abuse cycle all too well and it s been programmed into me and has an affect on my interactions with everyone I Äôm sick of it Just don Äôt expect my cynicism or sarcasm to go away anytime soon haha That Äôs always been me even as a child Honestly maybe it Äôs best if we all moved on and made new friends but it Äôs up to you I really don Äôt have the patience for you not taking my expectations into consideration and I don Äôt like feeling like I Äôm a doormat for you to step on and I know you feel the same If you value our friendship I Äôll do the same but if you re going to be a bitch about everything you can go fuck yourself,Attacking Behavior
So a lot of other subs I ve read and groups mainly targeted towards the spouses of those with bpd is actually quite disgusting I have bpd diagnosed few months and was also with someone who had bpd though he wasn t diagnosed I m sure of it though he was way extreme so he was very abusive and I did manage to leave but I never carried extreme hate for him afterwards because I m a fucking human being who understands this person has been through extreme trauma as have I At least I m working on it am I right Also to forgive someone and emphasise from their perspective as to why they ve become this way including me has given me extreme sense of peace So anyway I was disgusted at some partners who are actually more narcissistic and fake than we are Pretending to support their bpd partner in reality then speaking about them like monsters online like a bunch of snowflakes behind the screen Ugh makes me annoyed those are the ones who were lucky enough to grow up in healthy environments and not have to endure what we did Anyway I m not condoning abuse at all from this disorder I was just shocked to see NEWLY WED people moaning about their partners bpd history and oh no what have I done and other disgusting things Those are the real monsters in my eye Please note I m not talking about The ones who recognised they re in abusive relationships and are trying to leave but rather the ones acting fake and then saying truly sickening shit about their partner online and their tough disorder online Shame on them,Attacking Behavior

There s been several situations where I clearly remember being physically harmed by someone being shoved into multiple items and even given a black eye while having my glasses broken right on my face I know for a fact that I did in fact have a black eye because I went to my therapist appointment with it and felt embarrassed But that person swears up and down that they didn t give me the black eye that I fell And while they admit to some of the physical harm we both have shoved each other toxic I know they tell me that I remember it wrong From my memory I would say something that was too far and they would come rushing at me from another room and scream in my face then shove me But again they insist that I m remembering that wrong and that s not how things happened I feel like I m crazy Because I know people with bpd misremember things or perceive things wrong So I feel like maybe he s right But at the same time these memories have haunted me for years and they ve never once changed,Attacking Behavior
I know she has a lot of bad influences in her friend group they constantly harass her and sexually violate her well I m dealing with those people on my own there s one in specific who also has BPD and on of their people sorry I really have a lack of understanding but one of his people and one of my gfs people like each other and my gf wanted to know if it was ok that they date each other whilst still with me personally I try to keep an open mind but I m not sure I m comfortable with this please help im stupid and have terrible typing skills so ignore grammar and capitalization,Attacking Behavior
Hi so me and this guy have been together for now 8 months He Äôs been very vocal about his bpd since the beginning of the relationship Hes told me that he has abandonment issues and hes scared to be hurt I reassured him by telling him that i would never do that because i grew up in a toxic environment like that and i know how it can hurt people and destroy them Hes my first love and honestly i saw my future with him But recently i found out that hes been sleeping with other people from dating sites and that hes been flirting with girls from his past I took some time to think about leaving him but honest i dont want to Im willing to forgive and try to understand him A pattern that i saw when i searched his phone is that hes always looking for validation and he likes attention Hes told me in the past that he likes the excitement of flirting with people Im here to ask advice on how i should confront him about the cheating part should i get the proof to him if hes denies it Should i explain to him how hurt i am or should i just break up with him If i break up should i be aware of some tricks he may pull to manipulate the situation Should i cry Should i stay calm The truth is that i really dont want to lose him and i want to show him that im there for him but i also dont want to be gaslighted and manipulated or even taking for granted for wanting to help him Im also asking for advice because when he gets mad he gets impulsive and says things to hurt me but i never react because i know its out of anger and hes feeling everything at the same time I also need to say that i really do feel his love towards me but now im just confused,Attacking Behavior

to preface this im 18 the other day at my job i realized that every time i have a woman manager i try my best to make them love me as i have been rejected by my mom this always turns out terrible for two reasons i just tend to overshare and become over dependent on them and 2 the city i live in is full of TOXIC TOXIC ass people this resulted in my manager telling me im mentally tasking upon her i cried at work i also g n ral just don Äôt have a good time at work due to the sheer anxiety i experience from customers coworkers and managers i want to put in my two weeks but i do like my job a lot and i Äôm saving up to go to college this fall secondly im still in high school and these toxic people are SO mean to me even when i Äôm just sitting there someone told me to fuck off today after i asked if they had 5 1 bills to trade for my 5 and i began to walk away i constantly have people laughing about me and talking shit quietly around me i don Äôt know what i do to make these people so mad especially the adults in my life but i know i can Äôt keep taking these comments i want to get out of my city but i have to wait for the fall and college,Attacking Behavior
it Äôs likely that my own partner might stumble upon this post and if he does then so be it i feel fucking stupid for starters i tell him constantly to be honest about his emotions because for the love of god it Äôs tiring to guess what he Äôs feeling guess how i should react based upon that guess the more i have to emphasize this need for honesty the more distrust i carry and that caused another issue yesterday i constantly expressed that i was upset and did i want him to ask why yes i did but god whenever he asked what was up i feel like i should just hold back i Äôm there for him a fuck ton yet there have been enough times where i couldn Äôt vent despite his permission to do so because he wasn Äôt able to handle it so how was i supposed to know if he was being honest about being able to hear what he did that made me upset that day i feel like pure shit i went and told him to go fuck himself told him i had a valid reason to be Äúmildly aggressive Äù because its hard as fuck to trust him i hate myself man for the last 24 hours i Äôve wanted nothing but to block him and delete him off everything pretend our relationship never happened force the two of us to move on already and just crumble into a ball it hurts because he Äôs all i have and he Äôs the only person who treats me this well so why do i have to get distrustful and aggressive and fuck everything over i hate the expectations i hold him to my hypocrisy i hate how hard relationships just are its hard to even get out everything i want to express without worrying about him finding this reading it i dont feel like i deserve to be able to express how intense my emotions have been all day and even if i did surely itll fuck over his mood this time its so ffucking hard i have no idea how to even continue this but i know theres so much more i want to say yet im here sobbing at 3am because i cant sleep,Attacking Behavior
If I read an article about BPD sufferers in relationships it is like I m reading an article written exactly about my GF The emotions are complete roller coasters One minute she s all over me and telling me how amazing I am the next her eyes glaze over and she s literally telling me she hates me and I don t love her She will spend hours coming at me with every possible thought she can dig up every piece of evidence that convinces her I don t love her Hours are spent talking sometimes arguing about her feelings and needs and thoughts When she wants sex we MUST have it right then and there or she will feel completely rejected and become angry When she doesn t want sex or to even hear my voice there can be days that go by where there is almost no contact at all I ve tried to subtly hint and directly suggest that she get therapy and perhaps there is a disorder that would explain her emotional dysregulation but she insists it is just anxiety she takes meds for this and becomes VERY angry and tells me to never ever suggest something is wrong with her again The worst possible thing you could do that would end this relationship besides cheating is to tell me something is wrong with me and I need to get some help Yet we are going on 1 year of the same cycles Week after week day after day an almost clockwork like cycle of love hate with very predictable responses to situations and my actions during those phases What do I do I ve even suggested therapy together but she doesn t show interest Is there any way at all to guide a potential BPD sufferer into therapy so they can get help Has anything worked for you or others with BPD,Attacking Behavior
I hope I don Äôt offend anyone by posting in this community I have never been diagnosed before For anything Besides doing my own research over the past few years and having an ex best friend who was diagnosed with bpd I felt like I Äôve always related to some of the traits of bpd I Äôm a 24f I have a 8f daughter I Äôm currently 11weeks pregnant I got a little triggered today and all day it Äôs been affecting me I did some self reflecting and realized this wasn Äôt my first rodeo Whenever something doesn Äôt go my way I have these outburst I try to be controlling towards the ones I love around me I have played the victim before many times I do acknowledge whenever I Äôm out of line but not all the time There are times where I do try and work on myself Then I have these setbacks I even have moments questioning who the hell am I How come I haven Äôt started in my career yet Why do I barely have any motivation left in me I dwell on the past I Äôm not always in the moment I have low self esteem I have trouble concentrating I don Äôt have a whole lot of trust in myself I rely on my boyfriend and the way he makes me feel grounded This leads me to what triggered me earlier today My boyfriend 26M and I got into an argument We rarely argue and whenever we do it Äôs over minor things but the problem it Äôs me who picks the arguing He does his best to be patient with me hear me out try to understand and deescalate the situation but I don Äôt let it go I drag it on and just end up making my boyfriend feel the pain and misery I Äôm feeling in that moment He told me today he felt like I didn Äôt appreciate him enough and it was hard to hear that because I didn Äôt want to believe him I thought he said that out of spite Then I started to think about our argument and started dwelling and over analyzing every word we said to each other I Äôm not going to lie I have been more emotional lately because of the pregnancy but I also still believe there Äôs something mentally wrong with me I just recently got approved for women Äôs Medicaid I can Äôt afford to see a therapist or psychologist at this time I apologize for this post being all over the place I did want to vent but I also just wanted to see if there Äôs anyone who can maybe offer some advice My boyfriend means a lot to me but I know with my attitude it can be overbearing I need to start putting in the effort and start somewhere I Äôm going on my second child and I Äôm scared for him her I thought by now I would get over some of this anxiety I Äôve carried with me but it doesn Äôt seem like I Äôm getting any better I want to be a strong woman for my kids and myself in general,Attacking Behavior
Empath just means you re basing your self worth around whether or not people like you It s still all about you It s still all about how much you feel like you re worth You re just a sociopath with extra steps that you feel like make you a better person when all they really do is reveal to you what that mindset is really worth Empath Whatever Go ahead and pretend your selfish world is actually about other people It s not You never actually figured that out You just added an extra layer to pretend like you re capable of caring about others beyond how they impact you and your own sense of self Sincerely someone who knows they ll only ever view relationships as transactional but at least is willing to be honest and try to give the other person a good deal,Attacking Behavior
Hey so I m currently struggling with my girlfriend and her BPD She was diagnosed a while ago after being re assessed from the Bi Polar diagnosis she has had for years We ve been together for over 2 years and honestly I m starting to lose hope She has two personalities that I ve gotten to know well One side is the most kind gentle bubbly person I have ever met the one I fell in love with and the other is this incredibly evil entity When she s triggered and in an episode she lashes out and breaks things screams and says the most hurtful horrible things to me The last time we had a fight she said some things that I m not sure I can ever let go I don t know what to do to help her when she is triggered and I m kind of lost I m trying my best to understand because I know she had an extremely rough childhood and this all stems from the way she was treated as a child but at what point do you look at yourself and realize you need to make a change That you can t treat the person who loves you the way you were treated it doesn t make it okay Basically where I m at now is do I stay and try to figure it out with her or do I walk away She always apologizes after these fights and seems to know what she s doing is wrong She says she wants to make changes and has gotten onto a DBT waitlist and has downloaded some DBT apps I guess I m just afraid of it not working and me continuing to get hurt Is it worth it,Attacking Behavior
Something so simple I was playing city skylines and I asked my boyfriend what the highways that goes off the ground and goes over other highways called I even sent a picture of what I was talking about I have to build it so I can Äôt say highway in the air when searching for a tutorial I don Äôt have a license and I don Äôt drive so sue for me not knowing it Äôs called an overpass He was laughing about the way I worded the question which didn Äôt bother me because it was worded kinda weird but he was like ÄúIt makes me so mad when people word questions stupidly like listen to what you Äôre saying lol Äù And that pissed me off Full rage in a second He told me it Äôs just a highway and that Äôs it After like 10 minutes I got my answer I literally had to go into a forum for people learning English to find the word lol I told him it was an overpass and he was like Äúyeah Äù and I was like Äúthat Äôs all I was asking you didn Äôt have to talk to me like I was stupid you could Äôve just told me Äù Anyways long story short I told him if he Äôs going to talk to me like I Äôm stupid then don Äôt bother texting because it Äôs annoying Was he talking to me like I was stupid Debatable not really but it feels like it It was a big overreaction of course and it Äôs so annoying to deal with because I can Äôt even describe how I went from laughing with him to hating him instant rage,Attacking Behavior
My younger sister let Äôs call her S has been working on her mental health She has a therapist and we Äôre working on getting her a psychiatrist We don Äôt know for sure if she has BPD or BP2 or MDD or something else or a mix that Äôs why we need a professional opinion but we do know that she has bad mood swings where the most trivial things irritate her It Äôs gotten to the point where our youngest sister who is only 13 is constantly nervous and scared of saying doing the Äúwrong Äù thing in case it makes S mad When S is mad she stops talking and interacting with everyone and can spend up to a week by herself in her room this week long isolation has only started happening now in the winter I feel so terrible for my youngest sister who already lacks so much social interaction because she Äôs been doing school from home due to COVID and the most socializing she gets to do at home with her sisters usually leads to S getting mad Every couple of weeks my 13 year old sister bursts into tears when S gets mad and she Äôs beginning to expect anger from S now I don Äôt get upset with S when she Äôs irritable because I know it Äôs hard for her but my youngest sister thinks it Äôs because I Äôm showing favouritism to S I don Äôt want to demonize S in any way because I love her and am trying to support her but this is all hurting our youngest sister and it must be so much for a kid to go through Any advice on how I can comfort my youngest sister,Attacking Behavior

i posted this yesterday but my original post was v lengthy so nobody rly read it so ill try to go into less detail this time basically there was tension with all my friends anyway since i broke up with my ex in november and everyone sided with them plus another argument that happened with most of us i stayed close friends with my ex after that though and fully made up with others but then had another huge fight with my ex on sunday because something i found made me paranoid fought 2 other friends who i wont go into detail about but my ex would tell them EVERYTHING about me while we dated so then i absolutely SPIRALLED like started posting rly childish shit ab them accusing them of cheating on me etc theres been a new groupchat with my ex friends since then thats basically to talk shit about me ive been out of my friend group since monday and i know my ex sends all the messages i send them to the new gc i did p much spam them but i was like desperate for a reply so i started a fight with the rest of them last night got called a freak psychopath etc and then after that fight reality kind of hit me for the first time in days i didnt realise until then but i had been very out of touch with everything and felt like there was some sort of Äúhigh Äù so i felt good about fighting people i honestly thrived off the drama something i tend to do ive lost a LOT of friends to that even when i was as young as 6 or 7 but now i have to deal with everything and my friend group are very unforgiving and most of them have me blocked now but i have to see them in a week from today and i know i shouldn Äôt but i honestly think im gonna approach it then also id been losing friends since november so i had one friend outside my group but she sided with them when i told her what happened she did apologise but honestly im too paranoid rn to forgive her and yes ik i was in the wrong i tried to apologise a ton when i had that fight with the 2 friends my ex but they basically called me a freak and said nobody ever wanted to be my friend in the first place,Attacking Behavior
Title basically says it but idk how to handle this Example just happened tonight where he was sad about missing his parents dog and I was trying to comfort him But usually I can t figure out the thing he wants to hear fast enough before he starts escalating things and being mean unfair Like in the middle of this he kept saying I was being lazy half assed I don t care fuck this this is annoying stupid all this between 1 2am and I know I have no option to press pause for sleep or anything even though I have to be up for work in the morning I have tried setting boundaries around literally all of these behaviors and explaining how this feels from my end how it makes it so hard to help him he will agree when we can rationally talk but when he gets upset and wants my support and he always asks me it s nobody else it all goes out the window and it gets really intense I need help my whole night is completely ruined again and he s not happy either,Attacking Behavior
i want real answers on this all opinions and no hate pls i think this whole trend of setting boundaries has started to go too far i truly feel that people are starting to put up full on concrete walls around themselves so that they don t get hurt respectfully we are all learning to respect ourselves more and love ourselves more but with that movement came the ideology of i don t have time for people cause i have to focus on me and i think that is flat out S E L F I S H yes i said it your boundaries are starting to become selfish i don t think we should close ourselves off other people because we don t want to get hurt or hear something we don t want to hear and accidentally get triggered LIFE is life people are going to hurt us but it s not about STOPPING people from affecting you it s about YOU learning how to NOT let something affect you for example WHAT is trauma dumping that s the most selfish sh t i have ever heard don t get me wrong i understand not being in the right headspace to deal with someone else s problems but at the same time i think that s selfish too not to say that everyone needs to have people pleaser energy but at least care enough to listen to someone who needs to talk to someone they might not have to talk to therapy isn t accessible to everyone i guess what im trying to say it where is the love i have personally always had the capacity to put my problems aside and be there for someone who is in need but these days people are closing themselves off from having empathy and only caring about themselves and their precious feelings i stand by what i say to recap i don t agree with trauma dumping being a negative thing it shouldn t even be called that when it s really just venting if you can t be there for a friend that s truly selfish of you and overly setting boundaries outwardly towards other people is selfishly putting walls up around yourself so you don t get hurt would love to hear some thoughts,Attacking Behavior
I don t think anyone is ever going to actually love me No one really knows me I m a fucking mess And as soon as I fall apart people are confused and then they leave Everyone is always like Oh you re so great so sweet so nice lol Inside I am this flaming ball of rage But the funny thing is the title was something my FP said She would always tell me Oh you re such a good person You have such a beautiful soul You re beautiful inside and out And I would always tell her that I m really not I can be kind of awful and I m a mess And she would say no you re just really honest You say things people are too afraid to say amp x200B And the moment I fall apart split act out in anger she s so fucking surprised And now she hates me which is weird because she has anger problems and mental health issues as well I feel like she put me up on this pedestal and played with my emotions and then just discarded me when I became an actual human being amp x200B Same thing with a former friend of mine I don t think he ever truly wanted to be my friend he just wanted to sleep with me He told me I was perfect so many times And how wonderful I am Again I tried to tell him otherwise but he wouldn t listen That is so exhausting amp x200B I think that s why I did what I did I didn t want either of them in my life anymore because they made me feel things I didn t want to feel I felt backed into a corner So I exploded rather than imploded and now I have no one But that s what I wanted right But now I m so angry and it seems like I m never going to get over this and I want them to hurt just as much as I m hurting amp x200B But anyway I don t think I ll ever find someone that loves me for me and all of my messiness and whatever,Attacking Behavior
My boyfriend is ill mentally and physically and I have been taking care of him for the past few days going shopping doing laundry making food etc Which I didn t mind But now it s PMS time for me and I m always suffering from bad cramps and even worse mood swings I get snappy and sad and the self hate and feeling of emptiness is a lot stronger during this time as are my irrational thoughts about how my boyfriend doesn t really love me and other things I ve been awake since 9 a m doing laundry and cleaning the flat all morning despite my cramps and horrible mood and the thought of waking him up for emotional support hadn t even crossed my mind because I knew he wouldn t be able to wake up for me he s on SSRIs and they make him sleep 14 hours a day even when he hasn t got a fever He just woke up for about 10 minutes at 3 p m to have some cereal and announce that he will be sleeping until tomorrow I feel lonely and resentful I have the urge to do something really serious to make him care Like write an ambiguous letter about where I ve gone or just leave without a note and sleep at a hostel for the night It would give me some space as well to think things through properly and I would be the one to leave instead of being rejected in my own flat It s much harder when he s there and asleep than when he s not there at all I feel bad for not looking after him but if he s just sleeping I m useless anyway And my brain is like How can he leave me alone when I m struggling He must not love me Although I know he s just ill Any perspective is appreciated but please don t be mean to me I m struggling to think and I don t know what to do,Attacking Behavior
I was very recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with BPD I m 24 years old and it went unnoticed for me for a very long time I am usually a jaded person and don t show emotions or let people in 3 years ago I met an amazing group of people in college and we quickly became the best of friends I really enjoyed their company but my walls where so built up I was never able to let them in Until last year where for some reason I told myself that maybe letting people in isn t such a bad idea So I started opening up more to my friends and I quickly became attached I developed attachment issues it started feeling like my worth as a human being existed only as long as my friends showed me love and care When they would be busy or not talk to me as much I would start having panic attacks it would feel like I was going to die To deal with that feeling I did a lot of messed up things being in denial and not thinking that maybe the problem was me and how I was feeling I started having tantrums telling my friends they are bad people for not checking up on me I started creating false situations where I or someone in my family was having a critical medical condition so I would make that horrible emptiness in me go away I lied manipulated gaslighted and hurt the people I loved the most And they took it for a year until they noticed that the lies who where very impulsive made no sense and that it s not normal for someone s family to have so many deaths in a short amount of time So they cut me off for being a liar and it s what made me seek therapy I m happy that I have a chance to be normal and the diagnosis makes me a bit relieved because it means I m not completely hopeless But I feel so lonely and miss my friends so much I never imagined I was hurting them I just needed them and it was easier to lie than admit that there was a problem,Attacking Behavior
I got close to him again in the past weeks and it s triggering me in horrible ways I haven t felt so bad since we broke up When things are good he gives me so much validation tells me that I m the best person he ever met celebrates my progress etc But things are starting to slip and I m so scared of the effect it s having on me It s 6 30am now I have been crying and screaming all night Last night he texted me that he is feeling lonely Tried to drop by at my place I tried to explain that dumping his emotions on me like that is making me suffer and that I don t have capacity to help him He got angry I called to explain and the conversation really degenerated He said some things that are really haunting me now Reminded me of the times I was abusive to him prior to the breakup He admitted to lying to me when he helped me out during an episode last week When he said he was happy to be there and help me He said he didn t feel I deserve help because I go through this kind of episodes all the time I need to get the strength to get him out of my life I need to find the skills to cope through today amp settle my emotions I m sorry for the rant I know it will pass but it does feel like the world is burnig down around me Genuinely grateful for any advice,Attacking Behavior
I always seem to forget how bad things can be until I have a lapse in medication Does anyone else find themselves in the middle of an emotional episode repeatedly asking themselves to just Stop I found myself unable to stop speaking Not even engaging just talking to myself I have feeling it has to do with being unheard but I wasn t being heard I kept asking myself verbally Why can t I stop talking I kept trying not to taking moments of silence but then I would just start Talking again I hate feeling out of control It sounds so much like excuses externally and it frustrates me but it lot feels as though I am not controlling my own mouth Being on meds makes it so so much easier to keep those intrusive thoughts inside where they belong This is my brain its so frustrating that a broken piece of it can hold so much power I end up internally screaming at myself to be logical and now apparently verbally I m also doing it In moments like this it feels so natural to separate the person speaking those words as if they and I are two separate beings But in the end I know that isn t healthy And I know that to the person I lashed out at I am just me He can understand as much as possible but being attacked from a narcissistic rage is still going to hurt And maybe knowing I feel like I cannot control my own words helps a little but I cannot expect his empathy to block his pain I hate this I m so glad I just got my meds again and I can gain control once more,Attacking Behavior
I finally opened up to my mom who was diagnosed with depression about my personality disorder I thought that maybe she would understand me just a bit more because she is also to put it bluntly mentally ill unstable Last night we had a huge argument because she found out that I got tattoos without her knowledge and consent I know that I ve deceived her by hiding the tattoos for nearly two years but what hurts me the most is that she told me your body is mine and you ruined the most precious gift I gave you with these hideous ink on your back no amount of therapy is going to fix that sick head of yours all because I went to get tattoos I m 19 this year and I ve never felt like I am in control of my life because she had been the one who decides on every single thing I do No I didn t get tattoos just to piss my mom off just because she thinks tattoos are a curse in some asian household there s a lot of superstition about tattoos bringing bad luck To me I didn t believe those sort of crap because I m an atheist I respect every religions but I dislike it when people force their religious beliefs on me I just wanted to get a tattoo that has a meaning to me something that belongs to me I also think that it s unfair for her to use my illness against me in an argument I just wished she could be more open and understanding I get that she is angry and frustrated I didn t mind getting grounded but to say things like you re never going to get better because you have BPD and the world seems to only revolve around you You re wasting time going therapy People like you are fucking selfish You don t care about those around you It just hurts because all of these remarks came from my own mother amp as someone who had been living with depression her whole life how is she stigmatising other mental disorders and invalidating pwBPD,Attacking Behavior
came across a great post yesterday that sparked alot of conversation and relatability I see today it got removed for breaking a rule it literally doesn t it was flaired correctly and the person used no specific details while the horrendous and disgustingly triggering comments left by one user about BPD on that thread are still there and the user still in this sub the fuck are the mods even doing here A user is allowed to spout off call other people in this sub delusional and in denial tell us we can never be in a relationship gaslight and twist our words and that s all totally fine by the mods but break what I m assuming is some tiny ridiculous technicality in your rules in a post and they ll get right on that we really do just get nowhere dont we there s nowhere we can actually breathe,Attacking Behavior

I know for a fact that my BPD is causing me to feel these things for him Two years ago he roofied me and raped me He wasn Äôt able to finish because another guy who was my crush at the time saw what was happening and stopped it I didn Äôt know this went down until over a year later I always kind of knew something happened between us but I didn Äôt know what In the following weeks after what happened my crush told a mutual friend that he liked me I was really excited but it turns out he had a girlfriend the entire time He cut off all contact with me He did the right thing by cutting ties with me but it was wrong of him to say that he liked me I just felt so empty inside after my crush did that My crush was the first guy to ever truly like me back so it all just felt like a huge slap in the face But my rapist reached out and checked on me He asked me if I was okay and he comforted me He told me that I Äôm beautiful and that it Äôs the other guy Äôs loss He told me that my crush Äôs girlfriend isn Äôt even that pretty and that I Äôm way more beautiful than her He said that while he understood my crush wanting to not hurt his girlfriend he thought my crush saying that he liked me was awful Part of me wonders if he Äôs been genuine If my rapist genuinely feels this way All I know is that after I fell in love with my rapist I know It Äôs sick But keep in mind that I had no idea he even raped me until over a year later But now that I know I don Äôt even care all that much Yeah it Äôs disturbing but he genuinely cares about me It would be great if we got together and had kids He was the one that saved me from heartbreak He was my angel He is my angel My crush is actually single now and still likes me but I Äôm not paying him any mind I still like him too but what he did is unforgivable I Äôm going to dedicate my time to the guy that actually cared about me and comforted me when he didn Äôt need to,Attacking Behavior

I posted a few days ago https www reddit com r BPD comments we4bws my_bf_doesnt_want_this_to_be_a_part_of_our_life utm_source share amp utm_medium ios_app amp utm_name iossmf Basically my bf of 3 years has anger issues in my opinion and is constantly annoyed frustrated bc of something He has a really short fuse In the post I said I forgot why we fought but I remember now I made him a cup of coffee that morning and because he wanted to cuddle I put it down in its usual spot in front of his bed he doesn Äôt have a nightstand As he got up his blanket got into the coffee and he very said very annoyed and frustrated Äúwhy did you have to put it there Now my blanket is wet Äù Just for context Ä Since Wednesday night I have a very weird pain in my chest and wanted to go to the doctor today yesterday was too hot to leave the house and these pains are unfortunately not new to me He was supposed to leave work at 9 15 and be home 5 minutes later I called him to ask if he wanted to come with me and if so if he could not stay longer today as the doctor is only available till 12 He said that he definitely wants to go with me as he didn Äôt want anything to happen to me on my way there He came home 45 minutes late Didn Äôt call beforehand or let me know or anything Told me he had to stay longer bc of some training stuff which apparently he knew in beforehand as apparently this is every Friday I was a bit annoyed but mostly stressed out because with time for travel that only left us 1 5h for the doctor and I didn Äôt have an appointment so I knew it would be very stressful anyways He was super stressed out and annoyed angry with me that I was stressed out and apparently Äúfollowed him everywhere though he just came home and wants to relax a bit Äù I said that we have to go now He told me that I play the victim again I Äôm selfish and I could Äôve gone to the doctor already on my own if it were so important to me to be there early And that if I could go there by train it can Äôt be that bad And that he didn Äôt eat anything yet is tired from work and just wants to relax for a bit before we go I got annoyed with him as well and told him I Äôll go alone and that working for three hours isn Äôt really all that stressful which was rude I know He followed me desire me telling him to leave me alone and that I want to go to the doctor alone On the way there he berated me some more but eventually apologised even though I told him we could talk about this later not in public and that I don Äôt want to accept his apology right now He apologised nonetheless and just kept being annoyed and frustrated for the rest of the visit and the necessary grocery shopping afterwards He now is very annoyed at me as I told him I want to spend some time alone Idk if you got the picture yet Ä he is a very annoyed person So I love him I guess but his behaviour I cannot tolerate any longer There Äôs so much more that I cannot post here for we all have better things to do how am I supposed to act now I think breaking up is the sensible thing to do as some of you guys suggested as well under my first post We live together and he Äôs somewhat financially dependent on me When I wanted to break it off the last time he said he Äôs gonna leech off of me as long as possible and that he won Äôt move out He Äôs not an official tennant for this flat moved in with me after his mother lost their flat and has nowhere else to go No money no nothing I don Äôt want him to spiral into depression and worries because of me breaking up with him I also don Äôt want to be petty and break up because of some minor issue that can be fixed He apologised Ä This got so long again I Äôm sorry,Attacking Behavior
So I posted the other day about being confused about the motives behind an ex friend with BPD s intentions amp feelings of why she ghosted me a few months ago I chalk some of it up to splitting but it s gotten to a point where I don t know if that s just it To explain I do feel that she started splitting on me in the month leading up to her ghosting me She started saying things in DMs on Discord that would indicate that s what was going on mainly that I did things I wasn t for reasons I wasn t However there s a few wrenches thrown in since that lead me to think that there s more going on here For 1 I never got an apology or an admission that that s what was going on amp an honest effort to make things better on her part despite the fact that she in the past had shown to me that she could easily recognize when her BPD influenced her thoughts amp actions in other instances 2 she s been making Twitter posts since she ghosted me that indicate that she legitimately thinks I m a terrible person posts about how I m like an actually awful dude we both knew over 2 years ago amp how people were showing her true friendship by doing things similar to things she amp I did mainly watching a show she likes together with them even though we did the same thing with movies amp YouTube videos when we were friends 3 she took a message I sent her explaining how she was wrong about some of these things amp pointing out other things as schizo amp victimizing a mutual friend of ours just because I sent him 2 messages that weren t actually that bad amp he told her about them after I did I talked with someone on here in the replies to the other post amp while I had thought it was petulant BPD they said that it was probably more of the impulsive type which I can see as both cause more narcissistic traits to crop up However I don t know if what s going on with her is just that or if something else could b going on If anyone can help me figure this out I d be grateful,Attacking Behavior
Someone very important to me who has BPD has started talking to this guy She seems to really have feelings for him but he treats her like shit Everyone in her life who knows is extremely worried about her and I m at a point where I m not sure what to do They haven t met in person but here are some of the things he s done so far Started masturbating to her on call without asking She could tell because he was shaking It made her so uncomfortable she had to hang up She had a friend visit from across the country He got mad at her for not ditching her to call him Told her that he sees her as a lesser valued human being because she s on disability Slut shamed her for having hsv Told her she s not allowed to talk to her male friends because a shoulder to cry on becomes a pole to ride on And that s just a couple examples There are more things She grew up in an abusive household and she s putting herself back in that situation We are all extremely worried about her but she insists that she loves him We are all convinced it s a really bad BPD episode How do we save her from this,Attacking Behavior

I don Äôt know what type of post this qualifies as or how you do that but basically I feel like my blowup was valid I dated an extremely abusive narcissist for 6 months In those 6 months he stole around 6k from me to fuel his drug addiction lived rent free in my apartment and ate all my food without ever giving me a dime for either stole a gun from my dad gaslit the hell out of me would make Äújokes Äù that were really just messed up pretended my IUD got stuck on his penis after sex and told me he Äôd never be able to have sex with anyone ELSE ever again pretended to hit a car but refused to pull over even though it was my car I let him drive and when i would get to the point of tears tell me I was crazy or Äúcouldn Äôt take a joke Äù later crashed that car on his way to buy drugs had s3x with me while i was sleeping on multiple occasions would scream at me for being crazy over things like me setting boundaries until i Äôd have panic attacks cheated on me multiple times and instead of apologizing blamed me for being nosy and going through his phone would go missing for weeks at a time without any communication weaponize BPD against me and made me convinced that i was insane and no one else would ever love me isolated me from all my friends and family etc This is the very slimmed down version but i Äôm not sharing that to try and have you all see me as a victim I want you to have the context before I tell you what i did I had him blocked an all accounts but one i forgot about it and got triggered when i saw him like a picture i had posted I Äôve been working on not burning bridges and trying to be the better person but he doesn Äôt deserve that i don Äôt want him ever thinking that what he did was okay although i know he always will because he Äôs a narcissist anyway i basically said stuff along the lines of Äúyou Äôre a cheating abusive asshole and have no right to like my pictures after what you put me through stay the fuck away from me you prey off young girls with money to fuel your addiction because you Äôre too lazy and incompetent to get a job you tried to bring me to my worst and couldn Äôt because i Äôm stronger than you thought i was don Äôt you dare to try to justify any of your actions with Äúlove Äù because you only care about yourself if i ever see you in public i guarantee i Äôll make sure everyone you Äôre with knows what a piece of abusive shit you are if anyone you Äôve stole from presses charges i will be the first one to testify against you even your friends think you Äôre a piece of shir when we broke up they reached out to me and told me they were so happy that i was done with you i want to wish the worst for you but you Äôre gonna end up dead or in jail in less than 5 years anyway so it Äôs not worth my time at the end of the day have a job education and a future stay the fuck away from me unless you want to me up in a ditch that may have been too far i honestly don Äôt think think me losing wasn Äôt warranted given all th stuff he put me and my family through but am asking if i went too far i know it Äôs not healthy to fight for with fire but it felt SO DQMN GOOD to stand up for myself after months of abuse did i go to far i also blocked him before he could respond because i didn Äôt care what he had to say and knew it would only lead to me sending more hate messages which as me setting a personal boundary progress i guess lol,Attacking Behavior
Was laying in bed and reflecting on my relationship with my boyfriend who is also my FP and I know I won Äôt leave him I love him too much but our relationship is so toxic and I needed some safe space to vent Back in Feb 2020 he called off our relationship lied to be about why it was ending Said he was unhappy after a huge argument very much triggered by my then undiagnosed BPD He immediately started seeing another girl Yet told me he wanted to focus on himself He cheated on said girl with me a few days after they started dating which he hid from me as long as possible went back and forth between me and this new girl for 4 months before they finally broke up and in nov 2020 we got back together i go above and beyond for him yet when I expect anything at all I Äôm told it Äôs not right to have any expectations like an i love you before bed for example If I ever being up how much I do for him and how little he does for me he Äôll tell me things like Äúhe doesn Äôt keep track Äù and Äúyou don Äôt do nice things for people expecting things in return Äù when I have an issue with anything he sarcastically says he Äôll just start simping he constantly is on my as about the say sh t he does to me But somehow it Äôs different when he does it If I have a negative feeling about anything he says does he claims I Äôm in a mood and sums it up to my bpd Making me wish I never told him about it In our over 3 year history on and off I Äôve only ever had a handful of apologizes He cheated on my with a GUY back in 2021 sexted a mutual friend and a few days later when I found out said he didn Äôt wanna leave me because he loves me but said it was a test so he could know if he was into guys too His friends family do not know about us being exclusive despite us always being together he has just never straight up told them After he cheated on me I left all our group chats and stopped coming around his friends family When they asked about it he said it was his fault but he Äôll deal with it I have been told that they through I was just having another one of my moments So he cheated on me and then allowed his friends family believe I was just having one of my freakouts It Äôs easier then 1 telling them about us and 2 owning up to what he did I did something I didnMt wanna do for him When I went along with it and he didn Äôt like that I went along with it I told him I did it for him and felt pressured He pulled and extreme and equated it to if he came to me every day for a week and asked to ra e me on day 7 would I finally cave and say yes Äô He constantly counters with extremes like this where he Äôll take a similar situation but it Äôll be so extreme that it Äôs very different But because I can Äôt argue it I have no way to win He gets annoyed when I don Äôt get him how I feel but When I do my feelings are often invalidated If I tell him this he Äôll spin it and say me telling him that invalidates his opinion or he won Äôt address my feelings and remind me in 10 mins everything will be fine anyway so why deal with it Don Äôt get me wrong he Äôs not a horrible boyfriend I love him but I do know he Äôs toxic as all hell with me And guess I just wanted a safe space to vent before I fell asleep No advice needed,Attacking Behavior

Hello I just thought I Äôd ask for advice on how to prevent myself 22F from becoming defensive in moments where i FEEL like I Äôm being attacked verbally even though I Äôm not It Äôs obviously easier said than done to just remind myself that my reality is different from what Äôs actually happening It Äôs even harder to take a moment and pause before getting defensive when I Äôm in the middle of a conversation My girlfriend tells me all the time that i freak out when she isn Äôt even starting a fight with me She gets upset because i lash out over dumb things just because i easily think that she Äôs Äúcoming at me Äù I tend to feel like the things she says is an attack towards me something i do or something i don Äôt do that bothers her But most of the time she Äôs just having a simple conversation with me that quickly escalates into something that neither of us wanted What would help in these situations,Attacking Behavior

Borderline Personality Disorder is not an excuse but it was the major factor of my behavior I m finally able to speak and admit that my mental health has taken a turn for the worst I did everything I could to better myself by learning to a few coping skills and distracting myself but in a period of what has at least felt like the last 4 months I disassociated and became an actual monster I looked in the mirror and could only think about how the person I was looking at wasn t me My thoughts were disconnected from my body It usually starts that way I fall in love get my feelings hurt fall out of love with myself and take it out on the other person because I don t deserve them Make em leave before they leave on their own they re going to leave anyways kinda deal I had it good this time Yeah there were faults to them but everyone has them I took it upon myself to push them away for falling short of the person I idealized them to be even though I loved them for who they really were It was always You re so perfect until they weren t what I made them up to be in my head or I imagined scenarios of them planning to leave me or due to previous trauma use me I out right LOOKED for things wrong in the relationship then spiraled on images of women that I looked nothing like that he wouldn t have stood a chance with at that and proceeded to eat both myself and his sanity alive thinking about them on repeat I became a terrible person AGAIN I fit the stereotypical BPD abuser narrative that I never wanted to be but ended up being I ve never been more remorseful for my actions in my life and can t even apologize for being actual garbage because my means of pushing them away this time were past deplorable and rightfully so they went no contact I m glad I m finally seeking help I m thankful that they supported me doing so before hand or else I wouldn t have seen the psychiatrist that gave me a C PTSD therapist referral This was just a rant of regret I guess Live life with no regrets as long as you don t hurt anybody is what I was raised being told and I feel like all I ve ever done is hurt people,Attacking Behavior

My partner has had issues with clenching his jaw from anxiety due to my past bpd episodes I used to have them 24 7 now I have a lot better control and will maybe have a couple a month at most if at all He Äôs recently started a band and was telling me that he Äôs getting jaw pain from singing in the studio He Äôs planning on seeing a vocal coach so I suggested that maybe the vocal coach would be able to help with that He immediately got very defensive with me and despite me trying to explain my thought process he kept getting more upset and agitated I extremely struggle with conflict and agitation aimed at me due to my childhood trauma but I tried my best despite being triggered to not be agitated back and managed to ask him calmly every time he interrupted me to stop which happened about 7 times The conversation went from his upset at my suggestion to talking about how the jaw pain is my fault and describing many of the previous episodes I Äôve had I had already gone numb and sort of shut down from his agitation and this added to it He wanted me to be more responsive and supportive about how he was feeling and I kept explaining that I was really struggling because of how numb and withdrawn I felt but I did make sure I was telling him I understood his feelings and apologised many times He went downstairs after a while of this back and forth and I kinda just hid under my blanket because I wanted to just be away from life He came back upstairs and pulled my blanket off me wanting to know what I was doing and after a lot of him ranting at me about how I caused how he Äôs feeling he ended up saying it was unfair that I Äôm not able to help him right now That upset me a lot because he caused me to shut down in the first place by getting agitated when I suggested the vocal coach may help I fully understand his upset around his jaw pain and the situations that contributed to it but I feel like I Äôm not allowed to get upset myself and if I do I have to just ignore it to make him feel better It Äôs exhausting because it takes all my energy to not let my emotions get the best of me and turn into an episode but I don Äôt know how to handle situations like this when I just don Äôt know how to support him It feels like I Äôm not allowed to be upset at how he acted towards me because my bpd episodes caused the pain he Äôs dealing with in the first place I Äôve been to many therapists and feel I Äôve improved greatly in holding back my emotions but I don Äôt know how to handle situations like this,Attacking Behavior

I had a terrible breakup with a person who absolutely wasn t concerned with my feelings Now I have this intensive anger and don t know how to cope with it I now catch myself having all sorts of crazy revenge ideas from sending the person feces amp attacking them with water bombs I know these are absolutely ridiculous but I cannot help thinking of them I lost control over myself one time two weeks ago and printed some stickers that said free person to be an asshole Äù Not only that but I placed them all around the street of that person I absolutely do not want this to repeat and I see that it was very childish and inappropriate but at the same time I do not regret it,Attacking Behavior
I know its not a good thing but does anyone get that feeling that you just want to show symptoms Like just for a little while you want to go off and be impulsive and rage and let it all out and be borderline It s so draining masking all the time and I kinda just wanna go off on people and destroy things relationships right now I m not exactly sure why I m feeling this way maybe it s because I don t feel ill enough Again not exactly sure but if someone wants to give advice or relate it would be much appreciated Much love xx,Attacking Behavior
I am struggling at work No matter how hard I try I don Äôt feel like anything is ever good enough And it just sucks because I felt like I finally was in a safe work environment where I had people around me I could grow around BOY was I wrong Today I had a patient call and I felt really overwhelmed bc I did not know how to help them So I went to ask my manager a question and I kept stumbling between thoughts She responds by saying ÄúC Äômon spit out complete sentences Äù And the doctor whom I very much look up to starts dying of laughter I felt so embarrassed and I just do not want to show up to work tomorrow This was not the first time my manager has said something really unprofessional rude This past Saturday she told me and 2 other coworkers that we needed to go to therapy I tried to joke it off by saying I already do and laughing about it But she replied by saying well sometimes going once a month is not enough Sometimes you should go more than once week but Id say that going over 3x week is over doing it I didn Äôt say anything back She also just treats me a lot differently than how she does to my other coworkers I don Äôt really know what else to do and I just feel so alone I have been having such a hard time mentally and this just knocked me down more I have been constantly trying to improve as much as I can and I just feel like a piss of shit,Attacking Behavior

I check her social media occasionally and she will make posts about wanting me to die talking about the violent things she did to me in the past or just seeing her and her friends talk about hurting me or other weird shit in the comments on a post she made in the past just dont look you say well ive tried tbh i went 2 years without looking at her page much but i think that only annoyed her cause i was sorta off the grid with social media for a while i used to receive prank phone calls i suspected were from her and last year they started coming more frequently i decided to message her and she seemed nice in the message but ended up ghosting me and would post hateful things on social media again then the pranks calls started for the next 5 months id get like 10 calls a day they ve stopped now for the first time in a while i wish i could still be friends with her but seeing as she has unchecked bpd this will probably never happen after i came out as trans she started posting all this hateful sht about me and i feel her black in white thinking has resulted in her just hating me,Attacking Behavior
Had a falling out with a friend back in early September and her behavior is becoming increasingly intense and fantastical I blocked her number and on social medias and since have received emails texts and calls from private numbers She has asked my roommate to go into my room and look through it is accusing me of increasingly serious things and becoming increasingly threatening She has reached out to my work my ex boyfriend and many of my best friends Thus far I have ignored every attempt to contact me and if it must be said am not doing any of the things she is accusing me of i don Äôt know if she believes them or is just telling everyone in order to make it seem that i am obsessed with her but is this the right thing to do She has a long history of becoming completely obsessed with people she feels have wronged her to the point multiple people that i know of have attempted restraining orders I don Äôt really know what to do at this point is ignoring the best course of action Do i just wait for her to move on to the next person who is Äúobsessed Äù with her What is going through someone with BPD Äôs head when they are doing this Thank you in advance,Attacking Behavior
My brother has been sexually abusing me for over two decades When I finally refused to be in the same room as him he started to psychologically torture me by inventing terrible allegations against me When my sister questioned me about these allegations I finally told her that my brother had been sexually abusing me She acted very sympathetic for a while but then when my brother made more accusations against me she took his side Then she acted confused as to why I was upset at her I even told her explicitly that I was upset that she and my brothers were ganging up on me When he made yet another allegation against me and I went to her she revealed everything I told her to him After they all ganged up on me again I made the mistake of venting to her This time she accused me of harassing her to my parents even though they re sick and elderly and I ve been trying to keep them out of it because there s nothing they can do and the stress of the conflict will just make it worse Instead she doubles down sending them emails and calls about me I feel incredibly betrayed I told her my brother was sexually abusing me but she takes his side every single time and does everything she can to make me miserable,Attacking Behavior
My ex and I had a really toxic relationship She sent nudes to some guy off tinder when she was stuck in resentments and trying to get revenge on me for the ways I had hurt her similarly Now six months later she wants us to be together But I told her I can Äôt because she told me that guy was 20 hotter than me and that she felt more sexual chemistry and desire for him than she ever felt for me during our relationship I know I Äôm insecure and have my bpd issues but I can Äôt be with her knowing that is the case I might be being unrealistic wanting to be my partner Äôs best sex and most intense attraction and desire She says that I Äôm being retarded and that it Äôs normal to desire someone more than your partner and that if I and we were more secure it wouldn Äôt be an issue Now I don Äôt know if I made the right decision in breaking up with her for that reason Please help me am I being crazy and unrealistic and unreasonable or is this a perfectly good reason to not continue,Attacking Behavior

I will try to keep everything as brief as I can and not go into too much detail I been in an LDR with a woman for almost year and the first few months were great with no problems and we were able to see each other in real life multiple times and have good memories with each other We spoke a lot about the future and how we could close the distance to be with each other in person permanently However her personal life is very tumultuous in ways because of external circumstances Around the 4th month of our relationship she became extremely distant and we no longer called each other and hardly talked I try not to bombard people with messages if they don t respond or don t really try to keep conversation up and this foreshadowed what I now suspect is BPD symptoms inside me I felt very anxious every day obsessing over whether she was cheating on me didn t like me anymore was using me etc It would turn into bouts of rage which I could keep inside and not bring up until I couldn t anymore She would occasionally suddenly become active with me again and act like there were never these very long stretches of time without really talking in a meaningful way I m talking weeks while her social media posts were very worrying and came across as flirting with others or being disrespectful to me as well as distancing behavior in other ways telling me she had doubts about our relationship etc that did not line up with the way we interacted at all This would cause me to become very angry with her and unload all of my pent up anger and anxiety on her and start circular arguments Fight make up silence fight repeat I said many hurtful things to her or make accusations without solid evidence but posts that looked bad to me and caused me to fill in the blanks I also would have to block her on all social media delete our chatlogs and ignore her because it was so painful to see her pop up on my feed or phone I would instantly regret this because she would always find a way to contact me this will come into play later We saw each other one final time in real life and there were absolutely no issues Less than a month later she showed me depressed posts from a different account she had about her ex who had broken up with her two years ago They were all made during and after my visits to her and read as if they were just broken up why couldn t he love me among other posts that made me feel like she didn t see me in her future at all This caused multiple blowouts as I was upset and she asked for a break which I obviously knew was really a nice way of dumping me so I accepted it and tried to move on She started heavily flirting and acting very different rebounding but she basically found no one else after me while making depressed posts that were about me for about two months This irritated me but I generally tried to ignore it no contact but she would occasionally contact me and I would get angry again causing an argument until I simply realized it wasn t worth the emotional strain and I would act politely then move on She eventually contacted me regularly and we are more or less back in a relationship which was her idea but its obvious she s hesitant we are exclusive but not official according to her despite the fact shes back to treating me in the same sweet way during the start of the relationship I let this go even though this is contradictory she told me she d rather take things slow to decide if this can really work which I agree with but this also makes me anxious that this is an easy excuse to dump me if she gets bored and wants to abandon me I suspect she has some form of Avoidant attachment based on the obsession with ex distancing and other things The problem is I am still in the cycle of becoming obsessive ruminating and reading too much into things and we have had a few of the same arguments over and over each one preempted by me deciding that I am finally done with her Deleting all messages and blocking except for one or two lines of communication in which she d contact me As I kept researching into what the problem could be I realized a lot of my own behavior was congruent with Borderline I am about to seek therapy for these feelings because it is heavily effecting my mental and emotional health I don t know if this relationship is healthy however I ve never felt the way I ve felt until I ve been with her I ve been anxious and depressed in the face of uncertainty in a relationship or rejection but I can usually bounce back quick and accept the situation I apologize profusely to her but I feel a lot of guilt and shame in the way that I respond to the things that bother me She has worked on communicating with me regularly and sharing whats going on with her life as well as telling me if she needs time for herself and we have been working on establishing boundaries so that I know where I stand easier and she is more aware of what makes me feel devalued and disrespected I don t know how to reconcile my trust issues rumination and wanting to take the nuclear option at the first sign of trouble to save myself prolonged pain I become very obsessive about how she feels about me but also if she s using me only for emotional security and is running around behind my back I feel the distance is a factor because irl interactions are very different I am very afraid this can never work and won t get better but we re both attached to each other No matter how often she reassures me I find a reason to not believe it,Attacking Behavior
Just wondering if theres a correlation cause I dont usually lash out sober and internalize all that anger but when I drink and something gets to me even if its small I go insane I mean I ve ended up in physical fights with people and speaking fights I lost my vape and 15 dollars at a party last night and I basically had a meltdown and some guys were looking at me in a judgy way so I squared up to them and they got kinda taken aback by surprise and I also lashed out at my friend bc I was stressed as fuck about it I regret it so much and feel so embarrassed good god,Attacking Behavior
i see a bit or narcissism when it comes to my bpd I get bored quickly if those don Äôt fill my needs as if the person never mattered or existed When i do find someone better to replace the last person with i obsess over them immediately and try and take full control when i realize i can Äôt take full control of the person or situation I spiral out of control and end up leaving i have to be the one abandoning the person not the other way around i Äôve never been the ex to reach out after a breakup first no matter how much i miss them the pride within me refuses to reach out i Äôll fight for the relationship the same day the breakup happens but end up finding someone else better the next day as time goes on i end forgetting about the last person i was so obsessed over realizing I never liked them in the first place amp the only reason why i did is because they can fulfill what i needed from them or what i feel like i was missing the cycle continues amp continues it Äôs more of a Äúwhat can you do for me Äù i Äôve figured out I don Äôt do well with texting new people i get bored quickly the same day blocking them or unfriending it Äôs my way or the highway in my perspective,Attacking Behavior
due to my social anxiety and bpd i haven t talked to or been around anyone except for my family and 2 3 online friends for about 2 years and now i m back in a place where there are lots of people around me lots of opportunities to make friends and talk to people now i get obsessive to the point that i sometimes stalk the people who have been nice to me i think i made my bpd much worse and i m horrified by the idea of this going on forever i don t know what to do,Attacking Behavior
My partner was told she has BPD about a year back We Äôve had such a rocky road with this Illness but this last episode seemed odd We had a normal day chilling I left to find the apartment to find a homeless person to give a whole pizza too When I came back my phone was unlocked No unusual I have adhd it happens We meet up with a friend and my partner is unusually quiet I thought it might been something I said as I can be impulsive I apologized for some words that could have perceived wrong to make sure she was able to get past it and move on with a better start while we Äôre hanging with her friend She gets a little more bubblier and things go well Later at night I wanted to go more into the conversation of how I hurt her with my words I wanted her to have more closure and if she needed me to apologize again I would She says she received a random text from someone pertaining to my ex Weird Ä she says that a random number texted her saying that I Äôm using her and whenever I Äôm done I Äôm going to get back with my ex The text said that I delete my text between my ex and I because everyone knows she Äôs Äúcrazy Äù She said the text was right and that she would go and hurt kill my ex if she found out if any of this was true Obviously it Äôs not true so I laugh it off and give her sympathy for what she went through Something like can really fuck up your day She said she deleted the text and the call log because she didn Äôt want it to bother her I got to thinking though at night and it kept me up Some of the details just didn Äôt add up I stayed up until 4am just thinking It finally clicked that she was lying I forgot what became clear to make know it was a lie but I knew with 100 certainty I text my ex maybe 1 2 times a month I believe that she was a text from my ex which isn Äôt bad because we are both still in contact with some of our former partners and decided to make up that story She Äôs always hated my ex but they Äôve never met nor had any contact with each other I decide to confront her mid day so I wasn Äôt acting irrational I told her that I got to thinking and I want to find out who it was She was resistant and said let it be the past I told her I at least want to block them every where so her or I won Äôt get cyberbillied again She started looking for an escape I was saying this to give her chance to confess I lost my patience when she tried to manipulate and gaslight saying the reason it effected her so badly was because basically I was a being a bad partner for the last 2 weeks So she didn Äôt want to talk about the text anymore I lost all my patience because we had fun and we Äôre better than the month before especially in the last 2 weeks I made sure of that by trying to switch new meds and actively being affectionate as my medication Straterra destroys the want need for any physical touch She finally confessed and I wanted to know why she lied More lies about how it Äôs about me and stress or something Her mannerism told me that was lie as well She says that she split and that she can Äôt remember why she lied or what made her dissociate while hanging with our friend She says she doesn Äôt remember a few things of the day She saying she split and that randomly she was feeling bad or anxious and it was easier to blame my ex for it But all the details of the Äútext Äù didn Äôt connect at all with what she was saying They aren Äôt even the same emotions she was describing I simply do not believe her I think she went through my phone while it was open and saw my ex and decided to make up the story She Äôs always tried to manipulate me in the past to keep her out of my life despite how not in my life this young lady is I haven Äôt seen her in 6 months and we Äôve been broken up for more than a year Can anyone tell me if this a symptom characteristic I need clarity Lmk if need more information,Attacking Behavior

The people here are usually great but I just had the unpleasant experience of dealing with a handfull of people who thought they know everything there is to know about me from a single post and then proceeded to harass me telling me I had better live my life as they command I know that s not everyone but I m really disappointed by the lack of support shown to me in such a dark time For those who will listen please do not patronize your fellow people on the borderline spectrum Just as you deserve respect so does everyone else Forcing your views down somebody s throat only makes them want nothing to do with you You re much more effective when you show love I will be taking this post down if I am harassed If you do it right here on this sub you will be reported to the moderators That is all Keep fighting the good fight and I hope you all beat BPD one day,Attacking Behavior
Everyone in my life is attacking me for my borderline symptoms even though I keep refusing to fight back and I m feeling like I m gonna collapse under the weight of all this abuse I was taking it quite well at first using all my coping strategies but it is unrelenting and I cannot get out of this situation They re using my mental illness as an excuse to punish me and make me pay for having been depressed and unable to help them with anything for the last couple days And the worst part is I just heard them all laughing about this a little while ago I can t tell you my situation but I cannot leave I am permanently disabled and unable to work I depend on these people My world feels very small I feel like my personhood has been stripped from me I am just a convenient punching bag They justify it all because I m mentally ill It s mostly words but I actually think their fists would hurt less They ve been saying the most awful stuff about me,Attacking Behavior
I fell in love with a boy a few months ago and became insanely obsessed with him and would go to gross lengths just to receive any sort of attention later on i found out there was another girl he was on and off with and although i Äôm unsure if he cheated on me with her or anything it was still just a really sucky situation being back and forth with them and him only coming to me when he had no one else i think ive moved on from him and i honestly think i Äôve became more obsessed with that girl than i was with him id go to extreme lengths to stalk her social medias so far i even created fake identities to get accepted into her private accounts whenever she posts about something i find myself catching that interest as well and it fascinates me and in my head i just started liking this stuff because i liked it and i always had interest in it but never the motivation to actually dig deeper into that interest and i thought that lately maybe why i actually started digging deeper was because i was getting my life together and had time for stuff like that but after multiple things i am starting to think i am literally copying her and i don Äôt know why i don Äôt think i am jealous of her i don Äôt feel jealous i Äôm sort of scared of her i don Äôt know she dislikes me a lot i just feel like anytime she does something i want to do it and i don Äôt know if this is apart of my bpd or if i Äôm just being cringe or something i don Äôt know has anyone else experienced something like this i hate it a lot and i don Äôt want to be accused of copying her but i feel like i literally am lol,Attacking Behavior
I d like to preface this by saying please know that I am aware I m a bitch and I hope it doesn t stop anyone from giving me thoughts on this I feel like I go through these mini splits where I will see someone as a friend and think positively normally about them but the next minute I ll start thinking really judgmental and rude thoughts about them sometimes for no reason and sometimes it s because they ve made a silly joke at my expense The latter totally shouldn t be a big deal but sometimes I ll laugh then later I ll start thinking things that would be hurtful to say to them about themselves I m not sure if this is BPD more of an NPD thing maybe or am I just a shitty person that can t help but to see negatives in people I wish I could stop this shit because it makes me feel horrible that I can t have a steady positive image of others and it has been my issue with relationships for a long time I also had a full on rage attack on someone a month ago who I was friends with for two years because I was paranoid that he wasn t actually trustworthy I basically just used anything negative about him that I could against him Sigh,Attacking Behavior

I accuse my partner of something I criticise his care or I break a boundary I majorly fuck up Understandably he needs space But space without warning kills me I go mad and act maladaptively This makes him want space more I get more upset I ask him if he will break up with me He doesn t answer I am convinced its over so then I engage in the abusive yelling and refusing for him to leave Why Why WHY can t I just look at myself and take a step How the hell did it get here I m clearly making it worse for myself but I m just acting on instinct I can t have him leave But what I m doing will make that fear come true ALL I had to do was calm down do my DBT exercises take 5 minutes But instead I reacted Push pull push pull Instability All I want and need is a stable life This is so significant and important when my entire mind is and childhood adolescene was plagued by rollercoaster ups and downs A stable outside world can help calm these stormy waters But I keep making everything around me unstable I am the cause of practically all of the fights the disagreements the conflicts I break boundaries unintentionally of course yet I still keep doing it nonetheless I blow up I act so erratically and I just can t calm down ALL I crave desire need want and dream of is a stable life Yet I attract instability everywhere I am convinced my partner will leave I am constantly looking for signs of abandonment I am triggered by the slightest differences in their behaviour I know I rely on their care and emotional regulation and that s causing me to be so fucked up How the hell do I stop this early before it gets out of hand What can I ask my partner to do to help me when things get so out of control with them How do you work through these emotions when all I want to do is scream and disappear,Attacking Behavior

I met this one guy online about 3 weeks ago He lives on the other side of the world So obviously would take some time to meet in real life I guess we were rushing too much especially for my mental health We started to focus on each other We were are kinda like dating but not in a relationship And he said he wouldn Äôt like me to focus on other men So I got too attached and started sabotaging things 2 weeks later It got me so bad that I finally went to drink with my friends and I got so drunk that I barely remember what was happening So there was this one guy who offered me to get to his place Äùsafely Äù Obviously I couldn Äôt go alone home The next thing I remember is that I was naked next to him And he was cuddling and playing around sexually I was so tired and intoxicated to do much And I have a history of getting actually raped So I froze and couldn Äôt say much I was just laughing awkwardly and trying to show with my body language that I don Äôt want it But at the same time I thought I ruined the chance with the online guy So I let him kiss me but didn Äôt let his hands go down there He still kept continuing until I told that I don Äôt want to do that He stopped I am really OCD about cheating and I feel like I was cheating on the online guy I have so mixed feelings about all this I am angry at myself because I didn Äôt just slap the hell out of the guy but I was too friendly and weak And that I went there But sometimes I doubt the online guy too much He Äôs constantly making jokes about breaking my heart etc What should I do Should I just take this easily since we are in the beginning and are in unclear page,Attacking Behavior
Hello everyone I am a 22F battling multiple mental health problems and undiagnosed bpd Right now I have had the same FP for the past year 22M We used to date and even lived together for 3 4 months the relationship spanned from May 2021 Feb 2022 and it really negatively impacted me I initiated the split unintentionally by asking him why his treatment toward me had changed Anyway this person was my best friend and after being together we had to set new boundaries he said he wanted to be purely platonic and I agreed to it Here s the kicker he initiates sex with me sometimes and I can never say no Usually it starts off innocently with hugs but it doesn t take awhile to progress further I usually don t say anything and just does what he wants This had stopped for the past two months because he s talking to a new girl but this past friday he initiated with me and we had really rough sex four times and it hurt me physically and mentally Afterward he just left to hang out with friends and the girl he s not cheating btw rn they are casually dating In the past I ve opened up to him about having difficulties saying no due to past abuse and even back when we were dating he would still try to compromise with me so we could have sex For example If I hesitantly say I have wake up for work in the morning he will just say stiff like he will be quick etc mind you it never is and usually ends up with me not getting much sleep I really just want dome guidance on what to say to him because I want to talk to him about it but I am afraid,Attacking Behavior
Like what the fuck did you expect You cry that nobody acknowledges you i fucking acknowledged you until i realized what you were you only come to me when you want something i don t need shit from you I take care of myself Whenever you offered to go somewhere with me like the mall or something i went with you because i wanted to spend time with you and i cared about you Not because i wanted something from you You are crying because you hurt me You don t get to fucking cry You have put me through so much shit and you deserve to cry Now you know how it feels I felt bad because i was always hearing what my other family members said about you How they avoided you How our parents treated you I was willing to put up with stuff to be the only person that seemed to care about you but i am fucking done,Attacking Behavior
Yesterday I left my undiagnosed BPD husband of 3 years who s had lifelong addiction issues He has since cleaned out our joint bank account and blocked me from contact This stemmed from months of lying and stealing money and resulted in my no longer trusting him He had been lashing out at me for not being affectionate to him obviously as a result of my distrust But he pushed me too far so I took some responsible distance and a mental health break from the chaos I fully expected to continue to run the household finances as I always do but his stealing the money has prevented that Thankfully i have my own separate account but I pay other bills from that So with money missing and no communication what are my resources to protect us financially I m still imploring him to get help but since I m blocked I doubt it s getting through Please no hate I ve gotten more than enough from him I m trying to do the right thing and also self protect Thank you,Attacking Behavior

Last night after 5 months of my relationship my boyfriend left me I thought we were doing fine but out of no where he blocked me and the day before we broke up he said I would ve left you by now for being so insensitive if it wasn t for your BPD I see people saying why stay with him for that long It s hard to leave someone because we make them our FP and when they leave our abandonment issues kick in he was also using it against me by coming online and then going offline straight away after he did that a few times before replying so I started making in my mins that he was cheating on me and then finally he unblocked me yesterday saying it s over and if you put your face as a profile picture it s over for good then he blocked me again so I thought oh well it s over for good and he lied about it being over if I use my face as a profile picture so I put it there and he unblocked me to say now it s over for good remove your profile picture do whatever you want now I m not sure what he means by anything he says tbh he always leaves me in my bad episodes mostly triggered by him And he has bad times but I always stayed by him and never blocked him like he did with me I did love him alot but he told me he never did I m thinking if I start relationships the other person shouldn t know I have BPD cuz they ll do everything they can to trigger me,Attacking Behavior
Hi all I m a officially diagnosed BPD with strong narcissistic traits I feel empty most of the time It s just like there s a hunger in me I can never satisfy The only way I know to momentarily appease this hunger is to find new sexual partners over and over again We don t necessarily have to have sex I just need the attention and to know that in case they would agree to have sex with me When I have sex with someone I feel like I m eating them like taking away a part of their soul or some characteristics I admire in them in order to feed myself Does anyone else experience something similar,Attacking Behavior
My SO is a really sweet and caring person since I met him He Äôs very calm and I always thought there might be nothing in this world that could make him angry But later I realised I am really good at pushing his buttons I got diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder recently and a lot of damage I have done to the relationship is so much due to my condition I demean him belittle him and sometimes even slapped him during my episodes He never hit me all those times but definitely held resentment because in our last few fights he increasingly got violent Once he shoved me saying are you gonna hit me come hit me The other time he responded to the slap with a slap and this time I was having a panic attack and he dragged me by pulling me from my arm all the way out of the apartment in the middle of the night After that we separated and he apologised and said that Äôs the last thing he wants to see himself doing in a relationship My brain started thinking he was never abusive before but started acting like that after my constant episodes directed towards him I have started therapy and work on myself so I don Äôt continue this behaviour ever I Äôm just so torn between guilt and thinking maybe it Äôs all because of me,Attacking Behavior
i can be completely fine and the second something minor happens i will lose my shit and potentially get homicidal like my brother always does this thing where he goes in and out his room at like 3 am and it Äôs fucking annoying i told him to stop and the idiot doesn Äôt fucking listen i Äôll be fine and i Äôll hear his door open and imagine myself bashing him with a hammer or stabbing him it doesn Äôt even have to be that it can be like making a typo over and over again i will lose my mind over little shit like that and it Äôs annoying it Äôs always been an issue and i don Äôt know how to fix it i know there Äôs like anger management shit but thinking about it makes me mad surprise i guess i just want to be fine without getting set off all the time,Attacking Behavior
Does anyone else feel like ever since their boyfriend girlfriend found out that you have bpd they dismiss your emotions Ever since my boyfriend discovered that I have bpd he Äôs been reading a lot of horror stories of people who have been In a relationship with someone with bpd He Äôll make sure to tell me about them and a majority of them say run away It almost feels like he Äôs reading them to me to praise himself for staying He continues to share these stories even though I told him it hurts my feelings Moreover now whenever I Äôm expressing myself my boyfriend will say things like here we go again like clockwork or your being manipulating dramatic or he Äôll say that I Äôm just having an episode Even if I Äôm just telling him I didn Äôt like how he was talking to me or we are having a disagreement on a certain topic I feel so dismissed like my emotions are never valid and I Äôm always just having an episode I do acknowledge that I can be dramatic and even manipulating at times but to say this almost every time I Äôm expressing my self just seems like a convenient thing to say to someone who has bpd to get out of an inconvenient conversation I feel so hopeless and feel like I Äôm losing my mind Has anyone gone through something similar,Attacking Behavior
me and my fp have been arguing recently and i don t know how to even approach it anymore i am so scared of approaching any sensitive or soft topic because i m terrified it will escalate and get worse i say things i don t mean things that make me feel like a monster in the heat of the moment but i genuinely don t know how to talk about the things causing tension without it getting to this point we just constantly play the blame game on each other and threaten each other and i just want to learn how to be a healthy communicator so i can move on from this stress and anxiety that im constantly feeling now i hate this i hate who i become in those moments,Attacking Behavior

Yesterday I went to a friend s place to do her nails I ve known her since we were in 6th grade and we are now 22 23 I just started doing nails last year as a hobby Shortly after i got there I learned it was her birthday and she had plans to go to her dad s place with her siblings and her boyfriend and she wanted me to come too I was happy to come along I did a set of acrylic nails on her and her boyfriend arrived about half way through the process but stayed downstairs after introducing himself We finished her nails and left her room to get ready to go to her dad s place the entire time her boyfriend was watching sports on his laptop I tried to get my friend in the mood encouraged her to do shots but she didn t seem into it I thought maybe if we head over to her dad s and hang out with her siblings it ll be more fun for her so I suggest we get going to her boyfriend to which he responded K you re getting annoying now Now this is my first time meeting this guy So he finishes watching his sports thing eventually it s getting kind of late by this point My friend asked him to grab a bag of sweet potatoes but he didn t hear her so I grabbed it We went outside to his car and i tossed the bag of sweet potatoes in the back seat He said Can you not do that It s a Mercedes not a Honda I apologize and we get going By this point I m already uncomfortable by his last two and only comments he had made to me He starts driving twice the speed limit and we live in a big city so the roads were kind of busy he had horrible road rage so I said maybe it s because they re going the speed limit We argued a bit back and forth he told me to shut the f ck up and that I can walk and he questioned why I was even coming along in the first place It s his car My friend asked us not to argue and told him he s not kicking me out so again I apologized and he turned some music on I just started crying quietly in the back because I have a curfew and I live on the other end of the city and I completely regretted the situation i got myself into He stopped at the liquor store to get some beer for himself nothing for his girlfriend on her birthday but that s besides the point We got to my friend s dad s place and I helped with dinner The whole time her boyfriend sat on the couch watching sports and drinking beer Pretty much not saying a word to her the entire time She apologized a bunch today and I told her it s not her fault he s an asshole I feel really bad and I wish she could see this guy is not a good person,Attacking Behavior

So I ve royally messed up Last weekend was really bad and it finally clicked of how bad I actually am to my husband So I made the decision that I would change I m going to beat this stupid illness and get into recovery from it He yelled at me for a while last weekend about how bad I ve been to him I went a week of being good and Sunday night I had a really hard time not dissociating at work and that triggered me into reverting back to bad me amp x200B I come home from work and he s not having a very good day himself I try to be supportive but I know I m not able to with the amount I had to work on not dissociating It really hurt my head not to He wasn t able to sleep but our kids needed to go to school the next morning I went to bed but woke up at 1 20am and he still wasn t in bed He did tell me that he would probably be in bed soon 2 hours earlier but by the time I woke up again I had felt lied to when all he was doing was trying to work through his own anxiety But stupid me didn t think of that and told him that he was being selfish by staying up and not going to get enough sleep to wake up properly in the morning He was half expecting an apology today because of how much I devalued him He s explained to me how I ve done so part of me still doesn t see how when I said I felt like I was lied to but oh well Just another part of the stupid illness amp x200B I had to go to work again tonight I come home and the door was locked I woke him up not realizing that he was asleep and asked why was I locked out Queue him yelling at me again for 45 mins and waking up our 6 year old sobbing quietly in a pillow fort she made and telling me all these deep down fantasies he has of him wishing he never met me and wants to go back in time to do so and how he hates who he s become and him changing so much of himself to please me I never wanted this for him Everybody is telling him he has to leave me He went to the doctor today for a checkup and apparently she told him that he has to leave me for the sake of his health I m trying to change I m trying to go into recovery from this and it s only been a week since I made the first step but according to him this is the worst I ve been in months I m not sure what to do He told me he wants me to get the hell out of this house and stay away from them and he hates me,Attacking Behavior

Met a girl it was casual at first then slowly over time especially looking back it was clear that I became her FP We were casual friends with benefits but things got bizarre and controlling and she started contacting people in my life to tell them things about my home and parenting and trying to make the case why she was doing all of the work around my house and helping out and that I was treating her badly IT was surreal cause it was so much fabrication She wouldn t apologize or be honest about anything and we had a falling out Too late She was pregnant We were due to give birth to a son I was involved the entire pregnancy She moved closer to my home We texted daily i went to ultrasounds midwife appts even paid for couples therapy when we were not and were not planning on being a couple I should have noticed the signs When we found out we were pregnant i was all excited and matched her excitement Then out of the blue I get a demand to meet with her at starbucks with her father and my father She asked me to give up all rights to the child When I said no she said she would then abort the child before letting me screw up the childs life and wont do that to a human being A few hours after that she said I wasn t worth killing kids over The next day it was an email asking what i would like my involvement to be like Within another day it was cute baby clothes and like that meeting had never happened where she said and wrote awful things to me about me etc At one point during a text conversation within 60 days of the birth of our child I even mentioned my biggest fear was that some small insignificant slight or perceived slight would cause her to just withhold keep our child from me She swore up and down that my fears were unfounded Then last month she asked me for help picking up something off of craigslist and I had a work thing She ghosted for 3 weeks and I found out from family she gave birth I was blocked on facebook and instagram etc so I got pictures sent to me from my immediate family whom she was still friends with on social media She named the child a first name that i suggested but she veteod and the middle name was my daughters first pick for a first name and the last name was her own While I was meeting with an attorney she had invited my family over to her home to meet the child NO mention of me No mention of them being grandparents Just bizarre Pending I am petitioning the court for genetic testing and then proposing a parenting plan Attorney s working on documents I have no evidence that she has BPD other than endless stories the 20 books on her shelves of Dialectal Behavioral Therapy and matching up DSM V diagnostic criteria text messages and experience with her The only reason I am even posting here is cause it matches so many things I know about her and in the hopes of navigating this My goal is not to destroy her or punish her for having BPD Rather I hope to build in some safeguards cause this is not good for the kid long term and perhaps if some other people were brought in to evaluate things could actually get better for her us and everyone involved Am I naive to hope that she would ever cooperate Or is the perceived stigma of a screwed up family unit too much for her to bear Anyone else deal with something like this,Attacking Behavior
Yesterday I was in my garden getting pretty drunk with my fianc FP and he had to leave because his mum was unwell and I started being passive aggressive about it and I feel like shit because of it and I did apologise to him and it Äôs all good but I feel so guilty After he left I had half a bottle of vodka and was just dancing alone around my garden with music blaring and then I passed out But I Äôve woken up now with so much guilt on how I tried to manipulate my fianc to stay at my place,Attacking Behavior
To start I d like to say yes I 22 F am not officially diagnosed with BPD I have been struggling with mental health since I was about 11 years old and I always thought it was just anxiety or depression About two years ago I was told by two different therapists that they believe I should be evaluated for borderline because of how many of the distinct traits 8 9 of borderline that I exhibit Not to mention that I found out recently that my father who passed was diagnosed with BPD My friend 22 F lets call her Lily has not been a very good friend our entire relationship She never defends me shows any sort of care for me and would invalidate me on a consistent basis I put up with this for over 5 years because I thought she was my best friend and that I was maybe asking too much Today I found out that a close friend of mine had overheard a conversation between Lily and another friend of ours I had sent a message in a groupchat that we have together saying that recently my mental health has been horrible directly affected by my BPD None of my friends respond to the message I m used to this None of my friends other than one long distance friend ever seem to care to offer me any emotional support even though I offer them tons So Lily is talking about this and my other friend says This is really sad and I wish I knew how to help her Lily responds with I don t know she s like undiagnosed I honestly think she s fine and then laughs My friend makes me aware that she overheard this conversation I am surprised that I was even surprised I should have guessed that she felt this way about me due to the way she has treated me for many years However it is still really hard for me to even think about My mental state is at it s absolute worst right now and hearing this has truly devastated me I tried not to be impulsive but this was the last straw and I let her know that I will no longer continue to be her friend I guess I am just looking for emotional support This is really hard I ve talked to my other friends and they agree that she has been terrible to me and that I made the right decision but of course my self doubt has gotten the best of me and sometimes i feel like maybe I ask too much in my friendships even after two of my friends have tried to convince me otherwise,Attacking Behavior
My girlfriend 19F has had therapy her whole life and is very good at managing her BPD but sometimes she will have episodes of pure rage for seemingly no reason For example if I forget to do something she will go over he top and say I never listen and I don Äôt even care about her etc etc If we have a disagreement she will not let it go for hours and say all I ever do is get my way and I Äôm a selfish prick I can Äôt point out unhealthy behaviours because this tends to backfire and we end up screaming at each other but her words in these rage episodes really hurt me and I find it hard to just take it Is there a way I can deescalate rage episodes efficiently,Attacking Behavior

So it s been a super stressful week our dog has been jn and out of the emergency room and surgery at his regular vets and in general a bunch of other issues that cause stress My fp and I got into an argument in which he started crying and hitting himself in the face screaming I was beating him so I did tackle him to the floor to make him stop He had a bruise on his face that he took pictures of and saved on the computer I also hit the basement wall and banged my head against the wall out of frustration The next day we was getting along fine things seemed to be improving the dogs health was doing better we didn t really talk all day but he would pop in and show me funny videos things like that Then the next morning he is back to being mad at me won t talk won t look at me won t respond to messages nothing just a sarcastic bye when I had to leave for work I get home and he says I twisted his arm in his sleep to the point of causing nerve damage and that he wants to put cameras everywhere to prove how crazy I am He also said he will never touch me again and that my ideas of a partner are wrong He shouldn t have to cater to me and talk to me all the time or have to stop what he is doing to talk to me Wr live together he doesn t have a car phone or job because I wanted him home this was a form of control I needed to know I could contact him whenever I get it s not healthy and very toxic Now I don t even know what to do we have emotionally hurt each other so very severely over the years and he seems very dedicated to getting revenge on me because I m the pwBPD I am very prone to anger screaming moodiness I do start arguments over unhelpful and unimportant things and am in therapy and on medication but it s not really helping much tbh We were bith in a physically abusive relationships in the past I have never hit him at most I will push him He has never hit me he has tackle me pushed me put his face on or in my face while screaming but I believe he would never actually hurt me physically The fact that he would tell my mother I hit him in the face and accuse me or internally injuring his shoulder in his sleep is very shocking to me and it hurts my feelings so much This man is my everything he pushed me to get help he actively helped improve my physical health he takes care of me like nobody ever has That being said the last 2 months or so have become so toxic I don t even want to come home anymore it doesn t feel like I have a home He doesn t want me their he won t talk to me and he knows I need him to communicate with me because I just emotionally spiral into depression and the cycle of feeling unwanted and unloved and just like trash Idk what to do should I breakup with him and throw the last four years and our future together away and just be alone He is my best and only friend but I don t want to go to jail over something I didn t do It s breaking my heart to think ot would come to that I m so lonely and unhappy is it fair to make that his problem I just want us to go back to being nice and playing vwdii games together watching shows together laughing about stupid shit but I don t see it being possible,Attacking Behavior

I have a friend who works in the same field as me and I know they ve been to therapy for BPD They are a very charismatic person to pretty much everyone they meet and is also just a generally attractive person This person and I have a pretty good memory and one thing I ve noticed they do that really bothers me is they will remember what people say and much later bring it up verbatim in a conversation as if it were their own original thought almost to intentionally build more rapport and trust with whoever they re talking to It sort of manufactures the feeling of wow this person and I are on the same wavelength but to me feels too calculated for it to be genuine It s super jarring when I realize what they just said is something I told them a year plus ago presented like it came from their brain I ve never really been good at reading people s actual intentions but have realized a lot of the time people are only interested in talking to me when they feel like they can get something from me or I m an easy target I m not sure if it s calculated manipulation or just something they do subconsciously but we had a conversation about manipulation in the past and how this person has used it a lot growing up so that s also worrying I m not sure how much I can really trust this person if they re constantly poking and prodding at me to drink their own proverbial kool aid,Attacking Behavior
So just some context I m a 24 year old straight male Since I was about 15 I ve had a best friend who did everything with me It felt like the only person on earth who understood me we grew up and graduated partied for a bit and traveled Then he decided to join the army realizing he would be gone mostly all year except once every 6 months for a few day visit I was pretty heartbroken Thought I d deal with it but it s not easy if anything I m resentful he left Only recently I realized he probably is my FP and I ve never had a male one It s usually female romantic interests I ve had issues with then I d just distance myself Now it s my guy friend so I don t know how to deal with it I realized he was my fp when he was coming down to visit and decided to spend more time with other people than me I lost it I blew up and panicked Thinking in my head I wish he was dead or I d never talk to him Now I m not sure if I should be his friend if he has this much leverage on me emotionally,Attacking Behavior
I ve been seeing my FP for a few months now we work together and only recently diagnosed so still understanding my symptoms We spent all night together a few days ago and it was amazing we went out with my friends and the simple thing like him holding my hand while driving home melted my heart yesterday he was busy so i told myself to relax and decided to go and see friends he messaged me later in the night i obviously still obsessed over him checking to see if he saw my text or to see if he posted on snapchat wondering what he was doing wanting to see him and speak to him even though i am learning to not over text all while trying to have fun with my friends which was hard because of the racing thoughts today i messaged first thing in the morning and sent a few snaps during the day he never responded i was busy so not able to check my phone and once i was finished doing what i was doing i called him to ask if he wanted to stop past we have a friends with benefits situation going The phone hung up after the 3rd ring and i have been stressing crying over thinking for the last 3 hours about why and what i could have done wrong I normally turn my phone off to try and avoid checking even though i think about it the whole time its off I have realised this is to cause them stress if they call me and it hangs up straight away then hopefully they get scared that i am hurt and will come running reality is that never happens and i cant leave it long enough without messaging them anyway Just really wanting to vent about it he knows my diagnosis and has ADHD and NPD himself so knowing he gets bored easy and loves attention has me even worse Any tips on combating these emotions Does anyone do the same thing Stuff like this makes me feel insane especially knowing now that nothing i do is normal,Attacking Behavior

Had asked someone who presently does not want to talk to me if I could have something back after a few days of asking I m very grateful that they did we haven t spoken in last few days and after asking for my stuff back they messaged me with a long thing that really seemed heart felt and genuine so I finished up what I was doing and answered right back though it took me a bit to type it out sent it and after a few hours I noticed they were doing something I had messaged them again asking if they were going to answer and after a few minutes after sending that they had said that they didn t like how I responded to what they said and that I barely addressed their points I genuinely tried to in my response and I re sent another message re addressing what they had said at the time last night it felt like they were helping me work through my issues that I have clingy and how I did things repetitively that bothered them it was like 3am when we were talking and I was kind of looking to go to bed so I told them I hope they choose to continue convo tomorrow today I passed out instantly and they responded while I was sleeping saying you re missing massive points I don t think you can see them anyway u don t want to that is what bothers me the most actually and why do you think I tell you this stuff first i believe they tell me that stuff because they care and I never intend to bother them but sometimes they make me feel like I have low self worth and they told me that the anger that happens from them only happens because I drive them to that point calling me pathetic idiot etc but anyway I answered when I woke up waited some hours and messaged again at around 2pm they dropped my belonging off when i wasn t home I have messaged them a lot by this point after that happened I sent them a long genuine thought out message saying that I don t want to lose them how I care about them and wish they took the time to respond and continue the conversation because I genuinely thought the convo was going well Waited until around 11 and messaged them again saying Well name I m guessing your lack of an answer is an answer I just want you to know it hurts me a lot that after we tried to talk you just haven t responded all day just know I love you and I wish so many things were different but I tried to convey and communicate with you through today to no avail wish our dynamic worked out I tried my hardest I m not perfect severely flawed actually but I care about u I put the effort in today to try to continue this convo w you today I wish you did too and I haven t heard from them all day I just wish if they are done w me they would have the care to tell me obviously I want everything to work out but I m just figuring by this point they re leaving me and don t want to continue the convo and I understand if they are just taking the time to think but they brought back my stuff and didn t even say anything and ik sometime throughout all day they were on phone saw message and I think that s what hurts the most Side note I had a panic attack the other night and wound up in the er the whole time I was in there I just wanted to talk to them hear their voice and realized that everything we have argued about doesn t matter I felt like I was dying the other night and it was sobering to the fact that I just want to spend life with them in it,Attacking Behavior

Okay so recently a few days ago I discovered who my mother really was and was using my dad for money and also cheating on him online And that my parents are divorcing She is a manipulative narcasstistic alcoholic and possibly abuses opioids last time i saw her on the floor with 3 5 promile She is online pretenting to be someone else Since I discovered her true face and I told her who I think she is she started gaslighting me 24 7 and guilt tripping me 24 7 She apparently has depression and she is taking xanax for years She seemed very kind was talking with me about helping the poor etc but last time she didn t care ab out the Ukrainians only herself but she is really egoistic manipulator that cares only about herself But I feel like she loves me but she wants to manipulate me because she is afraid of losing me My parents are divorcing i am moving to my dad and she seemed surpised and tried to guilt trip me She has a major alcoholic problem and she was extremely drunk about 20 times but denies it at first she told me only 2 times then I reminded her about one more time because I heard their convesration so she changed to 3 then I said no it was 5 she denied she my whole life semed reckless and spontanious and forgetful she is blaming everything on her poor memory amp x200B yesterday my mom showed me her true face i had a conversation about her alcohol problem and THROUGHOUT THE EHTIRE CONVERSATION ALL SHE WAS GASLIGHTING ME GUILT TRIPPING ME AND LYING AND WHEN I CATCH HER LYING SHE SAID THAT I MISHEARD HER THAT SHE DIDN T MEAN THAT etc she says that my dad is lying about her to me and he is making her evil but all he does is proving me actual facts that happened she is making herself a victim all the time and focuses on herself all she wants to make people go awww i m so sorry for you she is seeking attention everywhere but she wears mask also when i tell her about her problems she then reminds me of what i did when i was literally a FEW years old child with neurological disorder you aren t so perfect too everyone is human juice wrld was addicted to drugs but still was a good person you smoked cigarettes you are so spiritual but you smoked cigarettes you are so spiritual but you should forgive me and not say those things about me I NEVER OFFENDED HER she is often twisting facts and then blaming it on her poor memory she is constantly saying when i focus on facts and point out her lies that i am overly analytical just like my dad that not everything is black and white that all programmers are the same i recorded her whole conversation when she manipulates me she says that my dad is brainwasing me against her but literally she is brainwashing everyone and today when i said how he is lying about her and brainwashing me against her she said that i meant that he shouldn t brainwashing me against her lie against her IN THE FUTURE she said that i am in some conspiracy but all we are doing we are trying to make her see that she has a problem she is also brainwashing her sister i just discovered that my dad has been guilt tripped for years by her and he said i helped him realize that even more my mom is always charismatic and friendly to everyone her friends but when someone is trying to point out her mistakes she is saying we are offending her ior she gets extremely sensitive she never had a job never goes outside like literally all she ever did is laying in her bed and browsing facebook she recently opened a beauty business but she doesn t go there and wait but it s closed until someone calls her my dad always was buying her WHATEVER she ever wanted giving her everything going in the middle of the night to MCDonalds because she wanted a big mac and a shake expensive clothes jewerly and she always been guilt tripping him 6 months ago she said so someone guy on facebook while drunk that she loves him too also been flirting with perfect english with some guy while she always said that she can t speak english she always been nice to me and we had long converations but she always was extremely sensitive about taking photos of her nobody can take photos of her even if she is completely blurred her whole body pretty close about herself and confirming most of the things that i say and extremely unresponsible reckless and forgetful just like my grandpa that died a few years ago from liver failure from alcohol and drug abuse she was talking about being kind when i talked with her about my inspiration Juice WRLD an extremely talented rapper she always was saying aww how cute how innocent he is like a child poor Juicy why his kindness was always abused he is such an innocent person and that s true and always smiling when i showed a photo of him to her and saying awww what a cutie donating to charity but NOW i can t compherend how she can be such a bad person also she is EXTREMELY lazy she can t even make herself food amp x200B i discovered they are divorcing because when she passed out and ambulance came and whole town saw her drunk and she could t form a sentence only mumbling and 3 5 promilles alcohol was in her blood deadly dose for a regular woman and opioids she says that s meds for her headache i guessed her PIN 7777 and I saw she has 4 accounts one of them has a picture of a young brunette girl looking like a random google image and her conversations about divorce at first she lied about what happened but then my dad told me she is an alcoholic examples of her manipulation and lies dad told me that like a month ago when they were in hotel i was home alone she showed him a rare photo found it on facebook just to show that where he is hugging or not even hugging at all a woman on a photo to prove him he isn t perfect too isn t a saint too and then she told me that after that he started offending her and i asked her how did he offend you what he said about you then she said he was like imitating angry sounds and then she stopped and said okay he didn t offend me he was just yelling at me my dad said he didn t even yell at her she said something about not speaking about something near a child i said to her that i am not a child anymore at all then she said that she meant a biological child and i said that doesn t make sense and she said i am being overanalytical just like my dad and THEN she said that she was really giving me complement that she said that she meant that that s good that i am being analytycal and i pay attention to details when i point out facts she said i am lying and offending her and constantly guilt trips me and my dad and al she does is she makes a victim that everyone hates her etc btw honestly she always seemed kinda sometimes fake and always my dad was doing everything for me she always was lazy but when i was saying that now i think i ts disrespectufl but now i think it s true he was yelling at me that she is not i said to her that my dad said that when the Ukrainian refugees prayed for her together when she was drunk at the hospital she said that they are fanatics zealots and my dad doesn t like fanatics like she didn t even care what happened to her and how they are so kind she just said that they are fanatics she said my dad said that too and i said to her that he didn t and she said that he calls every religious person that believes in God a fanatic and i said that no he didn t and then she said that he said that they are overly religious and culty and i said to her that it was literally a few months ago and about COMPLETELY different people she said that he calls all religious people fanatics when i focus on facts and point out her lies she blames everything on her poor memory when i pount out actual facts and i think logically she says i am overly logical and not everything is black and white but when i said that i feel from her energy that she is manipulating and gaslighting me because she is afraid of losing me she said it s energy bullshit now and i should focus on facts and think more logically when i point out her stressed body language and that she is constantly blinking and that she is gaslighting me and guilt tripping me and my dad she says that oh you are reading too much these stupid psychological books when i focus on facts i am being overly analytycal or offending her when we say she has a problem and we want to help her she is denying it and that we are offending and disrespecting her and that is she doesn t drink every day that doesn t mean she is an alcoholic and that everyone is against her that she is so poor that s because she lost her parents blah blah blah and more and constant guilt tripping and gaslighting I LITERALLY NEVER SAW HER FROM THE SIDE but i want to distance myself as far away i possibly can i feel like she cares about me but she wants to keep me on her side and there were many situations where she lacked empathy or morality she didn t try to correct her behavior when my dad said to her he doesn t feel it anymore she just said okay so divorce and i told her there is fakeness in her eyes then she said that s because she is just tired and that i am overanalyzing I LITERALLY buy NONE of her bullshit NONE i can instantly somehow recognize when i am being lied to and manipulated also when i said about her that she may have a romance she said that you can t have romance online that it s impossible because there is no physical connection it s possible and she knows that and she said but you may have a romance too and then she reminded me when she caught me watching pornographic photo literally EVERYONE my age watches porn,Attacking Behavior

Backstory I have bpd because of the trauma I experienced from my mom and dad A little under 2 years ago I got my first bf I was 21 at the time and my mom was furious It caused somehow even more tension between us and one night I came home at 11 which was I guess too late She pushed me down ripped my purse apart scratched me and slapped me Kicked me out of the house that night and tried to take my keys and phone I moved in w my bf that night to live with his parents amp we got our own apartment 2 months later I didn Äôt see her for maybe 4 months after that She apologized over the phone but somehow turned it on me for being Äúdisrespectful Äù to her rules I didn Äôt want to but I apologized and accepted her apology Even since then she Äôs been acting like everything is okay Äúwhy don Äôt you come see me Äú Äúoh hey stranger see you in 2 months if you even remember us Äù just a couple weeks ago she yelled at me for not bringing food to a dinner amp that I should Äôve helped out So I don Äôt see why I should want to see her for Mother Äôs Day when she really hasn Äôt done anything to show she Äôs been a mother in the past couple of years I Äôm just worried though that she Äôs going to hold it against me and talk about me to family I Äôm scared that she Äôs going to be passive aggressive about it or say something like Äúwow after everything I Äôve done for you Äù I also don Äôt like confronting her because she Äôs always been really defensive and rude,Attacking Behavior
I feel awful my dad is an amazing person and I usually love him to pieces but I m splitting on him He s the second person in a really short timeframe and I m panicking I feel like a monster I want to hurt him I want him to feel bad and blame him for everything I m going through Im gonna distance myself for both our sakes but I don t know how to tell him I live with him and I can t even bare to look at him Im tempted to call my mom but she doesn t want to know about my symptoms as it s hard on her too I could obviously call my therapist but what the hell do i say I need advice on what to do and possibly reassurance that I m not an awful person,Attacking Behavior
A family friend has pointed out I m showing signs of BPD as she suffers with it also and I ve been told this by others in the past I ve decided I ve got to bite the bullet and question a doctor about this as they always put it down to depression and anxiety The past year it s gotten worse after my split from my boyfriend of eleven years even though I m in a new relationship now and I love him I m still struggling without my ex that I always find excuses to txt him he was emotionally abusive and he more or less pretends I dont exist anymore which drives me crazy I m taking this out on my current partner I threw and smashed a lamp at him the other day when I found myself out of control during an argument and everytime he mentions my ex it triggers me I ve broken our freezer after having an argument the other day and I ve broken the drawer My new boyfriend is very loud also when he laughs which gets me very irritable and I panic when he gets loud and I tell him to shut up and cover his mouth I say things I dont mean very personal things I have constant brain fog like my whole head is a mess and I m forgetting things even what I d got upto the day before I ve isolated myself and hate being alone but at the same time I want to be alone I feel like all my emotions are fake and I just act fake in general as I try my hardest to appear normal and sane etc Do I have to be worried or could this be something else other than BPD,Attacking Behavior
I don Äôt even think this post will make sense but worth a try to vent and hopefully get some feedback I have symptoms well aligned with BPD it gets pretty bad I argue with my significant other alot I go overboard I say crazy things I can Äôt come back from Anyways we have been arguing for a month have not seen eachother and today we started arguing again through text when we tried to talk I will deff not go into detail about the things I replied to him when he was saying some also not nice things but what I was replying was worse and in the moment angry responses that very very well crossed the line x1000 He made comments that I previously found hurtful in arguments we know what triggers pain in eachother so it Äôs like we were taking shots at eachother but for some reason the things he was saying no longer hurt Ä I have this weird sense lately of knowing who I am despite my flaws and being confident in that So while he was talking shit it was like Ä how to respond to something I know doesn Äôt apply to me Ä calling me names Ä making fun of my mental health Ä pls don Äôt try to feel bad about him doing this I swear I Äôm a million times worse with what I say that causes this reaction he would call me insecure because of my plastic surgery Ä blah blah and so on Ä I know my self so much Ä that I know I Äôm not insecure Ä I know I didn Äôt my surgery just for myself and no one else so him saying I do it for attention had no impact also other little things he would say Ä I just knew they weren Äôt true about myself Ä I left that argument feeling happy Ä almost smiling just because I felt like I knew myself regardless of insults that use to hurt It felt different The only thing I felt bad for was how far I went with how I talked to him Why do I feel happy after this Is this normal Wtf lol,Attacking Behavior
In middle school there was a super awkward but artsy girl in the gifted class I was in who was obsessed with me I always brushed her off because I was tremendously embarrassed by any female attention We went to different high schools so we didn t see each other for like 2 years but the summer of my sophomore year leading into junior I got an IG and added everyone I could think of I was insanely quiet at the time but had all sorts of internal scenarios with all these people They all probably thought it was weird that I was adding them because I only talked to like 6 people at school but I added literally everyone I could think of Anyway one of the people I added was the girl from middle school who was obsessed with me and when she accepted my friend request I looked at her profile and she seemed so insanely cool to me and I felt pure envy mixed with some weird form of lust and limerence I went on a camping trip super high up in the mountains that summer and I spent the entire time fantasizing about her being there with me A couple weeks after I got home from that trip I added her on snapchat and we started talking Within like two weeks we started dating and I completely transformed my persona to fit what I thought she wanted Before I started talking to her I was basically a Call of Duty playing Linkin Park listening dude bro but I made myself super artsy for her Indie was very in at the time so I started watching a bunch of Wes Andersen movies and listening to Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys and shit I completely checked out of school and spent all of my waking moments with her or texting her We fucked pretty much anytime we could After like a year of this our relationship got very rocky because I was constantly suspicious of her cheating on me or talking to other guys I knew her password that she used for everything so I would log into her instagram and facebook and look at her likes and comments and private messages and then concoct very obvious lies about why I had questions about her relationships with other guys who in hindsight were very clearly just friends of hers She broke up with me at least once maybe twice during the second year of our relationship and I remember being a crying pathetic mess during it but not much else I think I wrote her some letter about how oh so depressed I was and left it in her top dresser drawer and did the whole don t read it unless thing I joined the military about 2 years into our relationship and she broke up with me for good a few weeks after I got out of basic training I was an absolute mess for the next six months I am incredibly grateful for the friends I made during that time who pulled me through it but I am so embarrassed about how I acted I texted her friends her family and sent her multiple emails and letters she had blocked my number and deleted me off all her social media I even had my mom reach out to her which is the most cringe thing I can imagine and I m so glad my mom hasn t brought it up since That all happened like 5 years ago but I probably think about this girl at least once a week now in the beginning it was like every day all day I have had one other long term relationship since then and it really helped me think about her less but she was always in the back of my mind Anyway I broke up with the second girl almost a year ago now and have been single and fucking around since then I am at a very low point in my life and recently moved back to my hometown I talked to the first girl on the phone for the first time in like 2 years a couple weeks ago and the anguish and limerence has all come back I am so terrified of failure and I realize the only reason I still think about this girl is because of my giant inflated ego but I m drunk right now and want nothing more than to call her and just bullshit for a few hours And I m pretty sure she would answer if I did,Attacking Behavior

I try so hard I go to therapy twice a week I do the workbooks I check in with myself I know exactly what I need to do to be a better friend partner person and I want nothing more than to be that person but as soon as it comes down to it I throw all logic out the window and resort to manipulative toxic nasty mean behaviour I m hurting everyone around me my partner has so much anxiety and pain from all the past arguments we have had Not even just the big arguments but the little day to day things where I behave like an asshole because I can t deal with the stress or the overwhelm I feel like there are two people inside of me the logical one who wants to be good and kind and supportive and knows how to respond to things with compassion and the other person who is full of so much hate and rage and trys to self destruct and destroy everything with the smallest recognition of tension I feel crazy and hurt and so desperate because I can t keep being such a disappointment to myself but I don t know how to make actual change,Attacking Behavior
I F30 was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago I ve been doing better with controlling most of the impulsive crap alcohol shopping etc but lately its the rage I cannot control I have a coworker who is constantly targeting me They say it loud enough for me to hear yet my managers never seem to So everyday I m bombarded with how bad I am at my job and I usually just ignore it I m angry as all hell but I don t talk to them or acknowledge them and move on I physically and mentally can no longer do this I m so frustrated after almost 6 months of this that I m angry on sight of them And with this kinda rage it lasts all day right under your skin So a month ago I lost it They kept at me in a way my managers actually heard for once and despite that didn t try to step in So I hit my desk left Hit the bathroom walls Screamed Was scolded Nothing to them Again Last night same shit But I finally confronted them I was angry as hell but I didn t yell They said I yelled but I did not I was stern as hell and I told them that they need to stop talking about me Nothing they say to me is ever in any way of advice just that I did or said this or this wrong In their opinion Nothing that I can build from in a way of constructive criticism Just criticism One of my bosses told me I can t make a scene This person can talk about me everyday humiliate me with his work buddies about how bad I am as a worker person but I can t stand up for myself I m still so angry right under my skin that I can t sleep can t think Going into work to talk to head boss in a hour or so and just going to see if I can avoid him or just give up and quit I put more applications in last night the moment I got home I m so tired of being torn down and every part of me is screaming they can t take it either,Attacking Behavior
so while i Äôm currently working on my behaviors its strange that when i tend to have more self control around my FP my self control with any other person in my life completely is negative and i Äôm lashing out at them instead of my FP Ä until i split on them but even my splitting on my FP who is my husband is getting much better but still seems to remain someway for other friends but i also notice that since i Äôm spending all my time working on my relationship with my husband i find that all my other friendships go down the drain i Äôll isolate accidentally by not responding to others because i Äôll want to be around him all day or all night and i Äôll not respond to anyone or hang out with anyone else and then times i do have free time i seem to have no interest in wanting to be around my friends or enough energy to completely 100 care to keep up a conversation now i also noticed that i had a lot of other bad behaviors such as keeping people around in case my FP left me so i could get attention from somewhere else which seems to be the reason why ill go to another friend or when i split on my FP i immediately could go to someone else or currently me and my husband are in different places coz of his work so when we Äôre out of a call i immediately have to fill this with someone else now i don Äôt mean to write this to admit to purposefully manipulating to be evil or bad but im not always aware of it as it seems unconscious and with good intentions to just not be alone but you know looking back at it i see how it is me attempting to fill a void but i just find that as i continue to apply DBT skills and more it gets better slightly with my husband and we Äôll be smother but my splitting and actions will be 100 more amplified on other people who aren Äôt my FP husband and then they feel like i Äôm ditching them because my lack of energy willingness to respond or hang out wit them i Äôm in my 20s and diagnosed does this happen to ANYONE else delete if this isn Äôt appropriate mods,Attacking Behavior
Perhaps I m splitting and I ve definitely had emotional dysregulation like this feeling of stress in my chest and I ve been unable to focus on anything else for the past 2 weeks Falling behind on university work Abandonment anxiety triggered So I m quite sure that she was cruelly stringing me along with the intention to mess with me trigger me make me squirm as payback Could be splitting but idc at this point I need to move on I logged out of facebook and instagram deleted my messenger app and blocked all 3 using a blocker on my phone But as for the title yes I ve been feeling like if everyone just wants to treat me like I m this evil person when I m trying my best to get better then why not give them one Why not fuck with them the same way they do to me If my social skills ever get off the ground why don t I just break people s hearts It makes me feel better to think of it like that which isn t something I ve ever done before If I spoke to this FP in person and just told them that from now on I m going to try and demolish every person I meet after this What a satisfying idea But there s no way I could actually do that,Attacking Behavior
My Mom has always had what would be clinically described as emotional lability Her emotions are intense and her behaviors and mannerisms can get erratic Most recently she has started using different voices almost as if she s acting when she is upset She has phrases that don t necessarily make sense however are used in these really strange voices when she is angry about something Most recently it has been take back the steal she s a liberal and when my brother started dating someone who s family supported trump she d go on rants that were almost theatrical I can t describe it These personalities come out seemingly out of nowhere She also assumes the personality of whoever she s around down to their mannerisms She s expressed feeling like she has low mood and emptiness She will copy those around her down to mannerisms language tone of voice and volume Initially I thought it was the byproduct of having a really poor sense of self but now I m wondering if it s something more Her personalities range from exhuberantly yelling and calling people girlllll to talking in a low tone and using words that aren t commonly used in conversational settings She had a lot of trouble creating and maintaining friendships when I was growing up She has solid relationships now but she morphs into each of her friends whenever she is around them It s still really hard for her to make genuine connections She also seems to seek out a lot of drama intentionally provoking people and then acting like a victim when they inevitably tell her to stop The inverse of this is a mother and grandmother who loves her children and grandchildren fiercely I really appreciate a lot of things she has done for me and love her Her mental health and anger erratic nature has been such a challenge though I am wondering if it s BPD I d love to hear everyone s insight,Attacking Behavior
I Äôve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years now living together for a year I Äôm sure he has Bpd or bipolar as it runs strongly in his family but he doesn Äôt want to see a therapist or get medicated He has these episodes where something upsets him and he flips out at me then gives me the silent treatment for an unknown amount of time but this time is worse Yesterday he freaked out because i forgot to remind him to send his half of the rent and said that it would be easier doing everything on his own and that he will send his half and then he Äôs done with me He told me he doesn Äôt need me anymore and that i just make everything worse He told his friend that he was kicking me out and that he was completely done with me cause i Äôm Äòstupid Äô and only replied to my messages with the middle finger emoji then left me on read for the rest of the day When i got home he left right away without saying a word then slammed the door then when he got back he slept on the couch and slammed the doors again this morning when he left for work I haven Äôt heard a word from him and i don Äôt want to message him because i feel like it Äôll just annoy him more Is he serious about breaking up I guess we technically are over right now but we Äôve had a couple moments like this where he says to get my shit and leave then he changes his mind right away I just don Äôt know if this time is like the others or if he really is tired of me and wants to separate for real I just need advice on people that have been in similar situations on what happened in their experience and what i should be doing i know the usual advice is to leave and i am looking for another place to live but for right now i just don Äôt know if it Äôs a real breakup or if he Äôs going to switch back to normal after a while i don Äôt want to leave the relationship and i know what he does isn Äôt right but i really don Äôt need to hear that advice right now thank you,Attacking Behavior
I 19F have been with my girlfriend K 18F for 1 year and some change In the beginning it was very rocky because I still had contact with some people I knew were no good Fast forward a bit a couple months in a made a horrible decision to cheat Ä I am not justifying my actions in any way I actually am not even going to go into detail other than I drove 6h and stayed gone for 48h Anyways when I go back home we live together she swore up and down she wanted to work on it and it would be okay I have told her the story multiple times and have apologized profusely For the most part she says she has let it go and have learned to move on from it Unfortunately I want to say two months ago we separated and lived separately for a bit It started to feel like we were flirting we would hangout kiss all the good stuff I ended up moving back in and we are in fact together but she is so quick to catch an attitude swears that she isn Äôt happy and she hates me she wants nothing to do with me but once she has calmed down she apologizes and says she didn Äôt mean it and she was just angry She says she hates living together but we are stuck and have no other option which is kind of true but I just am so confused on what she even wants Does she want to be together Does she want to live together Does she love me I am just so lost and for the most part I do such an amazing job and so does she don Äôt get me wrong she does amazing walking away and talking from time to time There are other times when it Äôs completely chaos and we get physically or there is a lot of name calling and yelling Im not sure what Äôs going on and what Äôs even right anymore Everything feels so unreal We have done a lot of talking about how we are getting healthier and our relationship has so many possibilities and growth in it but the tiniest thing can set us up for disaster and she HATES me isn Äôt happy were a mess but then she was just mad and didn Äôt mean it Please any advice will be appreciated,Attacking Behavior
What I mean do any of you tend to or know anyone that tends to use the internet as a an escape and get SUPER attached to people aka girls online you KNOW you cant have and then just obsess over them and even show stalkerish behavior such as wondering about their irl sex life what they are doing allll the time trying to dox them and mostly failing basically EVERYTHING thats very very inappropriate to do and NOT okay but you do anyway just out of sheer loneliness and desperation and because you are afraid to be abandoned in some way when you USED to have a very good working friendship with said girl person but no matter WHAT you just cant get the hint and just cannot move on no matter how much you want to no matter how much obsessing over someone online like that is horrible both for your mental and physical health amp x200B To add some context thats where im at right now This girl and me used to be really close online her and me used to always talk first thing in the morning and before she went to bed but I started getting suspicions that she choose someone else etc and as it turned out I was right Now Im absolutely obsessed with her even though I KNOW now I CANNOT have her and she made her choice etc Im debating not posting this because I am not oblivious to the fact that this is SUPER creepy and NOT okay I need to let someone go but I just cant and to make matters worse its JUST an online obsession that makes this so much worse amp x200B If you all vent at me and call me what I am I wouldn t blame you its just like im being internally tormented right now in a sense at least LMAO this is what my life has become sadly,Attacking Behavior
It hurts just thinking about how blind or oblivious and stupid I was to not notice that there would come a day when the the person I looked forward to speaking to everyday would just stop talking to me Leaving my life without a word What did I do wrong Two of my greatest most honest friendships basically ended in this way I straight up asked the one chick if she hates me She said she could never hate me because I m great I wanted to follow up with ok so why did you stop responding to my calls It s 10 years later and I still neeeed you bestie but I didn t want to know the answer I thought it would hurt too much But every time I think about this loss I remember the sweetest girl that I ghosted in the most brutal manner after I had already experienced this shit myself I was supposed to visit her when she got out of the psych hospital I had visited her in hospital and I just never pitched and I didn t answer her phone calls She sent me a text asking why I just didn t say I wasnt coming or answer my phone I never responded The end If she ever were to ask me the same question do you hate me the answer would be that I would never hate her and that she s great I hurt a really great honest girl for absolutely no reason I knew I had committed to visiting but I didn t want to go so instead got myself too drunk to drive at 2 in the afternoon so that I didn t have to go I set fire to my house to kill a spider,Attacking Behavior
I am absolutely certain my mother has BPD Like there s no question about it I know it s one of the mental disorders that can actually be dealt with to some extent quite successfully I need advice how do I help her How do I calm her down What are the things I can say which might make her stop for a moment and then think How do you get a person with BPD to realize their thoughts are not normal at all and they need help Since I was a kid I have unfortunately had the feeling that someday something bad will happen which might end someone s life I am able to remember multiple events for pretty much every single one of the diagnostic criteria examples of how the disorder usually manifests itself She is 60 yrs now She has always been like this She was raped by her father when she was a child All her most serious problems anger and violence have to date always had to do with some man she falls in love at an extreme intensity and then after that it will be months or multiple years of really depressing madness She has some story in her head which is impossible to reason with When I was a kid it was more hard for me to witness it before later on when I understood that she is very ill The current madness is related to my brother s cancelled wedding My brother and his ex have good relations between them although the news that their wedding is cancelled came out yesterday My mother simply won t let go of the thought loop that my brother s ex has cheated or done something from vile intent There has been nothing like that My brother s ex just simply couldn t get married My brother and his ex have been talking about it thoroughly and the decision is just between them and so is the reasoning and what led to it Sure even I think that it s weird that they were together for 10 years and were supposed to get married next month and now they are splitting up But I have seen my brother face to face asked questions and listened to him and there is nothing sinister about this whole deal My mother won t believe it She already began harassing the ex I saw the messages and almost cried how insane it everything looks like once again Hours of message spam with stuff that could be pulled from a movie script The words adjectives made up stuff is so wild And she keeps sending that to my brother s ex nonstop I knew this would happen When I heard about this I immediately called my mother and told her that let them sort this thing out ok She should be silent just incase they are still talking the situation through and that who knows they could fix it yeah yeah I won t call her Then a few hours later that day my mom is calling messaging and harassing my brother s ex Now I ve been talking with my mother on the phone a few times today my brother doesn t have the mental strength to deal with it I just called her and first didn t know what to say When she started with her nonsense I told her that after talking with my brother what my mom is saying and believes simply is not the truth It didn t help and she kept saying the same stuff on a loop I repeated that she has a made up story in her head which she for some reason believes as the truth and that me and my brother are really worried about her That made her super mad and she wanted to end the call but I told her that I loved her and that I am just really worried how strongly the situation is affecting her At no point did she sound sad She was mad at my brother s ex mad at my brother for some reason and was getting mad at me I told her that I am very deeply sad that while my brother is splitting up with his SO of 10 years we are once again having to make the situation about our mother I tried to explain that her actions are making us brothers sad and anxious and that this is not the way to support my brother right now If he says mom please stop harassing my ex she should do exactly that But she never listens to anything when she is having an episode She doesn t hear anything else but her thoughts Over the years I have had to go over her place and calm things down when she has got violent and very scary towards some man he had in her life at the time It is almost impossible to stop these episodes The only times I have been able to stop her screaming for the night is when I myself have finally broken down crying and screaming from exhaustion frustration and sadness from the bottom of my lungs Everytime this happens my mother at some level becomes more distant It s so damn sad,Attacking Behavior

So I was talking to this girl for months and we clicked very well I would feel comfortable with her and it was mutual but then I started stalking her on insta and she came to know about it and then she blocked me from there I liked her very much and got along perfectly so I remained there and we started talking once again and I confessed my feelings btw her contempt for my action was mitigated to infinitesimal and she took her time send her pictures of myself and so did she we both looked average and she also started to ignore my message which make sense since she is extremely busy as she has big shoes to fill but when she did came back she rejected me and now I just can t help but hate her she said that I m just infatuated even though I proved to her countless times it s not the case I hate how a person that has never been in a relationship is judging someone who has outnumbered them and worst of all I can t be her first I feel like this is because I sent her my pics and maybe she loves a friend of hers I feel like beating her rn and him rn im now putting extra efforts into workout and trying to be far far far stronger then I ever was so that I can show this animalistic bitch how it feels,Attacking Behavior

We got into one of our stupid little argument which lead to some massive disrespect last night Only thing I Äôm guilty of is that I used the wrong word which I owned up to immediately I meant to say ramble instead of rant and he turned it around saying he didn Äôt rant I do that not him Then he proceeded to wanna teach me what a rant was to which I kept interrupted him a lot when it first started turning into an argument because there Äôs no need to have that conversation I simply used the wrong word but when he turned it around I accused him of making a jab at me During the argument he said he was on Äòthe verge of blocking my stupid a Äô said he didn Äôt make a jab but then proceeded to say he Äôll do whatever the F he wants as I was trying to have a conversation he kept telling me he doesn Äôt care and to suck his D but said we can talk when I Äôm done acting 12 I removed him as a friend because there was no talking to him at that moment and the level disrespect wasn Äôt cool He then texted me continuing the fight During the fight he said he was done talking to me and I just need to go I reminded him he text me first and then said Äòand I Äôm ending it Äô followed by listing various aspects of myself and the relationship that is a negative He continued to text me and when I questioned why he Äôs still texting me when he just ended things he said I misread the context and that he meant he was ending the conversation He has never once ended a conversation by saying those words It Äôs usually ÄúI Äôm done talking Äù or Äúdon Äôt talk to me Äù and that Äôs usually how the conversation ends He Äôs never explicitly told me ÄúI Äôm ending it Äù And I viewed it as him breaking up with me He said he didn Äôt and that I took it out of context BUT i don Äôt think I did I think he meant it the way I took it but then immediately regretted it and tried to back peddle What do you think,Attacking Behavior

Hello I am writing here because I need some advice regarding toxic parents English is not my first language so excuse grammar mistakes I have always had issues my parents More with my mom than dad Dad kinda excluded me from his family they ve been separated since I was a baby I always hated on dad for excluding me but the further I get to see my mom act hectic the more I come to understanding why he distanced from me Now the problem starts here my mom I have always been living and siding with my mom She often changed her partners In the past she would blame me for being a problematic child and messing up her relationships Then I realized a pattern She keeps attracting those bad guys bad in a sense of actually abusive Her last husband was abusive would try to control what I eat when I eat when I drink he would lock me in my room punch me for not cleaning well enough mentally abuse me and right after we managed to get a restraining order against him she already met a new guy She actually helped him with getting out of prison He was in prison for attacking his wife and driving off with the children I won t really get into that because I know his wife also wasn t the nicest mother Anyway we moved into his really old house that is not at all ready for living We don t have a full kitchen barely working bathroom without a proper water heater My room has plenty of issues with mold it s not properly isolated I don t even have a proper door I have an extra exit through my room and they accidentally put in inside door instead of strong outside door Life with this guy was okay at start he was kind he tried his best to get him to accept me into the family hence my trust issues but then he became more and more careless he would yell all the time throw stuff around the house when he would have tantrums He also didn t finish the house so it would be suitable for living i have 4 other young siblings I ve moved away to a dorm last October so I ve only came to visit the house on the weekends I started to realize how messy the life actually is there They never clean the house was not once mopped or vacuumed in probably 6 months There are missing tiles there is no warm water for cleaning the dishes everything is falling apart My parents often had the opportunity to put more money and work in the house but instead they chose to get a new car get a dog for 2000 Ç that they aren t even properly caring about We ve been living here for 3 years and a half and the house is honestly horrible My mother rarely asks how I am she mostly uses me to babysit kids while she goes to shopping and drives around over the weekends All I hear when I come over for the weekend is yelling on my brothers mom always tells them to clean stuff she never cleans herself and if she is too weak to boss them around or tired she acts like a huge victim My stepdad then steps in like a brave white knight and starts throwing things around like a child having a tantrum Sometimes he even smacks my baby brother hard One of my brothers was really sick 39 degrees celcius fever and he didn t want to eat so my stepdad came to the table and punched the table so hard that his whole plate jumped and everything spilled My brother started histerically crying and he was visibly scared They seriously yell all the time There isn t one thing that they communicate without yelling and insults My parents don t have any friends They always blame people for being problematic They re hating on every neighbour we ever had My mood is very often ruined It got to the point where i said a silly joke in a car and my mom started saying i m not funny then my stepdad yelled at me how dare i make fun out of them and how dumb I am I crack everytime someone yells at me I burst into an anxious crying I want to move out I want to grab my dog and run I seriously don t want to live there anymore It has brought me such misery to go from a man to a man and continue the abuse I am wondering if anyone has any experience of running away from your parents or moving away Do I have any obligations to my parents Can I just grab my belongings tell them I am moving out I m 21 female and I have a best friend that could most likely offer me a place to stay I don t want to feel guilty for leaving my parents but I feel like I m at the last straw of handling their behaviour At this point I feel like I m their slave they put their frustration and anger on Any help is appreciated or advice Thank you,Attacking Behavior
We Äôve been friends for a few years by now we Äôve met in middle school right now we Äôre in high school but in recent months two things happened we Äôve grown a lot closer and their situation has gotten a lot worse And always being there for them hasn Äôt been easy so a lot of people from our friends group decided to step away and just avoid talking to them when they were in a bad idk how to call it Situation Mood You probably know what I Äôm talking about tho This made my friend Äôs situation even worse tho as they felt like there was almost no one there for them They always told me how much they appreciate how I refused to ever step away and was always the first to respond and listen whenever they needed help and in return they Äôve always helped me with a bunch of my own issues as an autistic woman and they were always there for me just like how I was always there for them But more and more often I Äôve had situations when they started lashing out at me when I tried to help them and talk to them and it can really hurt to hear these kinds of things for someone I care about They tell me to shut up or to Äústop Äù idk what they even mean by that stop what or that he Äôs Äútired of me Äù and of everything else and some more hurtful things I don Äôt want to share and I know that they Äôre not in a good place when they Äôre sharing these things but still it leaves me wondering if these things are what they really think of me deep inside Sometimes they also tell me to stop doing things they Äôre usually fine with or even like and idk what to do Like for example we Äôve had lots of conversations in the last few months about subjects related to sexuality something we were both making our first steps in He appreciated me for helping him figure these things out and giving him advice and in general being someone he could be open with about these topics and I appreciated him for the exact same reason but now he just told me to stop talking to him about these kinds of things and now idk should I stop even thought this is something that Äôs helping both of us because he told me to and I should respect it Or should I not stop because well it Äôs something that he said he appreciates and is helping both of us and I know that what he Äôs saying right now is coming from the very strong negative emotions he Äôs feeling at the moment and I shouldn Äôt stop doing something that Äôs helpful because he told me to while being in that kind of negative place and mindset Basically idk what to do and I never know what to say and I honestly feel hurt whever that Äôs justified or not by how he lashes out at me I guess that this is probably why everyone else started ignoring him but I refuse to do the same as I know that doing such a thing would make him situation way worse and I honestly and deeply care about him What should I do What I should say Tldr My best friend has BPD and has gotten worse over the next few months usually things between use are great but sometimes when he Äôs in a bad place he stats lashing out at me and idk what to say or do to help him I care about him and refuse to leave him,Attacking Behavior

We re in a long distance relationship and one of the things we do together when we re apart is play Call of Duty We were half way through a match and he started full blown screaming at me because I killed someone before he got the chance to Telling me that I m annoying and I ruin CoD for him because I always get the most kills out of the both of us and it takes the fun out it for him Then he kicked me from the lobby and told me he wants to play alone because I m so fucking annoying Now I m spiralling and I feel like shit One of the only things that I really enjoyed doing especially with him and now I feel like I can only play it alone or not at all And I feel bad for actually being good at something that I enjoy Why is my brain like this Happy Wednesday,Attacking Behavior
I have always told my ex that I get triggered by being ignored and blocked He will keep ignoring me tell me he doesn Äôt owe me a response or he doesn Äôt run on my time then will threaten to block me I start to spiral tell him to go ahead and block me then if he wants to keep threatening it Ä He Äôll block me I message him somewhere else he then repeatedly threatens me with going to the police getting a restraining order doing a wellness check and going to my family Ä then a few hours later he Äôll tell me he just wants me to fix myself and get better be better say that he wants me to be alright and doesn Äôt want to make my life harder Why do people do this I specifically tell them my trigger ask tell them not to do certain things and let them know they Äôre making it worse it goes far and then they say they want the best for me after they pushed my buttons,Attacking Behavior
This morning while I was driving to work I almost hit someone with my car and when I got onto the highway I almost hit another car because I couldn Äôt see due to how bright the sun was I started having anxiety and began crying hoping I would make it to work safe I called my mom who I had just seen minutes before leaving She was heading to an appointment so I knew I could call her I called her 19 times and she never answered This triggered me and made me so angry and filled with rage because I felt like if I had been in a really bad accident and needed her for any reason she wouldn Äôt pick up She finally called me back almost 40 mins after and she said her phone was on silent and in her bag This upset me because she knows I sometimes call to make sure she Äôs okay I went off on her I told her I didn Äôt know why she had a phone if she was going to be useless and I told her i wish something bad had happened to me so she could feel bad and that I hated her She immediately told me that it wasn Äôt nice I said that and kept apologizing to me for not answering When I went back to work I knew I had messed up bad by saying I hate her cause she Äôs so incredibly loving to me I called her and I could hear she was crying and she said she was sad and hung up the phone I felt like the worst person ever I called her 1 hr later to apologize and she told me not to worry that she knows I love her and that it was okay I was crying so much because I would never forgive myself if those had been my last words to her if something happened to her while driving I saw her later at night and I could tell she had spent the whole day crying I feel disgusting I feel like a monster and I hate who I am I hate this rage that takes over my whole being She doesn Äôt know what bpd is so it Äôs hard for her to understand where this rage came from There Äôs no excuse to what I said I feel like a horrible daughter and I hate having bpd,Attacking Behavior
Does anyone have any success breaking the terrible patterns associated with BPD I continuously get triggered with feelings of abandonment from my partner even though it Äôs clear he has no intention of hurting me It Äôs become so problematic My emotions get so high and I lash out and attack him for doing what he did He gets defensive because he doesn Äôt think he did anything wrong and it feels so invalidating to me I don Äôt know how to handle this It seems like it Äôs happening more and more frequently now and I feel so insecure in the relationship which makes me more vulnerable to feeling abandonment He has been very receptive of most of my BPD symptoms but this one is hard for us Because he feels like this is aimed at him while the others are more general problems That makes sense Is there anything I can do to stop my abandonment spirals I don Äôt intend to go into attack mode but I feel so hurt that I lose sight of the relationship I really don Äôt want to wreck it but it seems like it Äôs going that direction,Attacking Behavior
is it because of my family being shitty and abusive so It s normal and almost comforting when people act the same with me and that cause me to love them and want them to love me back possibly but I hate it so much I genuinely can t stop crying about this I have person A who ignores me all the time yet I seek their validation and love knowing damn well I m not gonna get it then there is person B who gives me so much love validation and want to do everything with me in theory person B is what I need and it should workout but I can t stand person B and if person A doesn t give me the slight attention that they usually give me which is lower than the bare minimum then I ll not spend any time with person B and flat out start to ignore person B amp pick fights with person B the healthy thing to do is to just ignore person A till they treat me right and focus my energy on person B since person B clearly fucking love me and care about me is it normal to strictly wanting people who don t want love us back I m tired tired FUCKING TIRED of crying about the people who don t want me back yet I love them with ALL OF MY FUCKING HEART,Attacking Behavior
The only person who I truly care about is myself I ve never been capable of loving anyone because I can t even differentiate between love and obsession I get temporarily obsessed with them and then hold onto the memories of these romantacized interactions that we had I don t feel any sort of sadness when they leave because I never cared about them in the first place and I m so used to being abandoned It s either leave them first or be left I can easily manipulate myself into thinking that I never cared about them but it works do maybe I never really did I m so selfish and I jump from having a FP to another because I don t want to be alone Whenever I like someone I start oversharing likr crazy so that they d pity me and like me Guess what It fucking works everytime I d even fake stuff about me so that I d mirror them I m so goddamn manipulative I hate it,Attacking Behavior
I met this guy at a party and didn Äôt think much about him until we kept contact We talked for 20 days straight and went on a date but still didn Äôt think much about it Don Äôt get me wrong I liked him but I wasn Äôt sure of my feelings but now he Äôs completely ignoring me and it Äôs like a hole in my heart I Äôve only really felt like I had a fp once but I eventually got over it in a year which ultimately was a while But I barely know this guy but I try to get every chance to see him at school by going to places he Äôll be lingering around his classes texting him non stop and asking his friends why he Äôs not talking to me I know I Äôm a bit of stalker trying to fix it but I just want some closure of what Äôs going on because it Äôs taking a toll on me and I Äôm not sure how to cope with myself because it Äôs like every emotion I feel depends on him ahhh help,Attacking Behavior
What Äôs the point of trying to find a romantic partner if ultimately I will self sabotage and be the most toxic version of myself and push them away and then feel intense anxiety for days and weeks over losing them Is there a point Should I quit trying to find love The dumbest most naive thing about me is I think my self awareness is enough It will keep me in check I know what to do this time How fucking dumb I Äôm trying to fill the void from my failed situationship by getting back on the dating apps and searching for someone new Wonder who my next victim is going to be I feel sorry for them already But you know what How can I even know ever if the other person is ever in the wrong when I will ALWAYS take the blame for the both of us I am so exhausted I am so sick of this shit Doesn Äôt feel like I will ever change I will either be unknowingly abused or be the abuser I wonder what healthy love looks like A healthy connection where I Äôm not spiraling out of control pushing and pulling hoovering feeling like shit and excessively apologizing rinse and repeat I Äôm fed up,Attacking Behavior
My husband and I had a really long fight Normally my episodes don t last more than 3 days This time it was 7 days and in that time I hospitalized him He told me that if it ever comes to extreme health risk that the possibility of separation would be on the table He hasn t come to a decision about it yet as he s not in the right mental state and he needs to calculate the cost Anyways I just learned the terms hoovering discard and love bombing I want to apologize incessantly and hug him and promise that I ll never do that again but that would be hoovering I know I love bombed him in the beginning of our relationship and now we re 10 years married and we both regret everything about our lives together We have 2 kids as well And looking back in the past I have hoovered him so much It s such a hard habit to break but I need to give him his time and space I invited him to watch a movie with me and the kids tonight per a mutual friends suggestion and the thought had crossed his mind that I was hoovering him I know I was last night with my ugly crying and saying I m sorry I m sorry I m sorry over and over again I hate myself for doing that but that s all I want to do,Attacking Behavior
I Äôll try to keep this short but I am trying to leave this toxic relationship I am in with my boyfriend of 5 years but I can Äôt because I Äôm stuck We are both very toxic for each other from controlling trust issues abusing each other mentally verbally and sometimes a little psychically pushing throwing things grabbing I am aware that my BPD is causing a lot of issues and causing me to flip and react very terribly to situations but he also has his share of mental health problems that make this relationship not great either I currently live in a state I do not have any family and hardly any friends in I moved here about the same time we started dating in 2017 and I Äôve been living with him ever since We moved way too fast and now we Äôre in this situation The reason I feel like I am stuck is because I know I am not happy with him and he can agree He Äôs a bit more in denial with the way he feels about being with me or not wanting to be with me but I Äôm trying to take the next steps and it Äôs not working I made a mistake of getting some of the people I thought I trusted in his family involved and it Äôs just turned this whole thing into a Äúagainst me Äù type of situation where now I feel even more alone than I was before I have no one here I talk to my family but they Äôre 1000 miles away and I have already made the decision I did not want to move back home mainly because they told me I can Äôt stay there either I don Äôt know what to do I found some places I can afford to live but he Äôs just mentally f ing me on right now and making me feel like a failure and evil person if I left him It doesn Äôt make it better that my only source of income is a job that his AUNT is the boss in I don Äôt think she can fire me just because I Äôve decided to leave her nephew but the other day my bf made sure to remind me if I left him the state we live in is an Äúat will Äù state aka they can fire me for anything I have a car payment and if I don Äôt have this job then I Äôm screwed I just feel so stuck and hopeless and I need advice as to what to do I want to leave this relationship so so bad Im unhappy and I Äôm tired of this constant control and abuse we BOTH do to eachother I don Äôt see how we can repair this and I don Äôt want to,Attacking Behavior

First of all I m undiagnosed I m looking for some insight We had lunch plans and she ended up ditching last minute while I was at the restaurant were meant to be at At first I tried not to be affected by it and spent the day out alone When I got back home all my thoughts and emotions got to me and I instantly had this rage inside of me She d posted being out with another friend at a mall a few hours later My mind instantly jumped to how I could ruin her life because I felt SO hurt There s some things she s shared with me and if I had to tell her boyfriend and mother she would get broken up with AND disowned My mind went there I felt like because she hurt me I would want her to feel the exact same sort of pain I was thinking about it for 2 days before I cooled down I told my best friend about this and she said she was so glad I didn t go through with it and I was relieved too That would ve fucking up a lot of things I posted a similar thing on another subreddit and people were calling me insane and saying things like obviously she doesn t want to hang out with someone like you and it made me feel horrible But it also made me realize that this sort of plotting isn t normal is it I ve come to post here to get some insight I ve had a rough past month and I keep wondering if all the signs point to BPD,Attacking Behavior
Now I understand in a healthy mindset none of these things are particularly bad it Äôs okay to have a big age gap in an adult consenting relationship and it Äôs okay to explore kinks I Äôve organised to meet up with this man later on today I Äôm 23F and he Äôs 53M I don Äôt even know what he looks like I do this all the time and I don Äôt know why I just want to be loved and wanted for a minute but I know that this isn Äôt the way to get that He Äôs booked and paid for a hotel near me for us to meet up at 7pm We were talking on the phone yesterday and he said some really questionable things I went with it for a while but then he said something that made me start uncontrollably crying like I went into full on trauma response panic mode Instead of asking if I was okay he said ÄúI Äôll make you cry tomorrow bitch Äù I know I don Äôt have to turn up I know I can walk away now before I do something I know I Äôll regret But I just feel that I can Äôt He Äôs talking about bringing cable ties and a ball gag because he said I should learn my limits and I Äôll only know them if he Äôs gone too far he wants me gagged so I can Äôt tell him to stop when we reach that point and that we can talk about it afterwards instead I don Äôt know what to do I feel like I Äôm obviously trying to relive something but for what At least I know I Äôm the one causing this I Äôm purposely putting myself into a dangerous situation so this way I have a little bit of control that I didn Äôt have when I was little Everything in me is screaming not to go and meet him but I just have to it doesn Äôt make sense I don Äôt know why I Äôm writing this maybe someone has been through it so I Äôll feel less alone idk,Attacking Behavior
So the last 5 or so years I Äôve been having some depression anxiety issues because of the relationships I have with co workers and everyone I ever interact with since I had worked at Amazon the wonderful online shopping service A few things arose when I was working at Amazon where I had maybe seemed like I was mad a few times because I was basically homeless trying to make the job work riding the bus I tried making a couple friends but it Äôs hard for me to have any type of relationship as awkward as I am with people At one point a work came to help me with the yellow tub stuck and he acted like he was mad mocking maybe the way I had been mad a couple times When he walked away I said THANK YOU maybe kinda sarcastically because he seemed like he was mad trying to help me Anyways it started as a cascade of people mocking everything I said and however my mannerisms are It Äôs phenomenal and quite hilarious how it Äôs came to this People All over my town Pretty much state probably because I drive 3 hours away and it happens there have mocked me saying Äúthank you so much sir I Äôm not a sir I Äôm a slave boss I appreciate it buddy awesome wonderful enjoy have a good one alright y Ä I work fast and other people act like they work fast I scribble my name everyone else writes theirs like a little kid or just scribbles a couple lines It happens everyday at work still and I don Äôt even work at Amazon anymore because they ruined my life Or bpd did I guess it Äôs my parents fault for doing meth and not picking me up as kid But goddamn everyone shouldn Äôt be treating me the way they do all the time we should be evolved enough to help people out of these issues as humans and not be shitting on them for anything they ever do But that Äôs just wishful thinking maybe I just don Äôt know what to do to ease myself through it everyday It gets overwhelming sometimes Ä I just need to surround myself with good people and I think even the good people mock me because I can Äôt make a decision with my splitting Black and white on the edge thinking Just had to get that off my chest because it HURTS too much cholesterol Thank you,Attacking Behavior
Without going into detail this diagnosis explains so much The sudden break ups severe mood swings destructive and controlling behaviour all makes a lot more sense now We have been on and off for the past 7 months since we broke up but recently we Äôve been on and it Äôs genuinely felt like we Äôre rebuilding a meaningful connection again She came to me straight away after her psychology appointment to talk to me about it and what it could mean for us in the future She shared her insecurities and concerns about it but also what she knows she can build on within her self moving forward She told me with confidence that she is willing to give our relationship a good shot again and I am too Being aware of her diagnosis we can work together and with help of her psychologist it looks like she Äôs getting back on track again and I Äôm willing to support her through all of this She Äôs asked me not to tell anyone about this at least until she Äôs ready so that Äôs why I Äôve come here to update this subreddit Anyone willing to share any experiences or give any advice would be greatly appreciated Thanks,Safe/Neutral

I have BPD and I ve been a relationship with my boyfriend for 6 months and we ve known each other for a year We dated for 3 months before but he lied to me about relatively small stuff so we broke up for a couple of months and then I took him back I ve been having serious doubts about the relationship for about a month but I m worried that it s my bpd that s acting up and making me push him away My main problem is that we constantly bicker and have been doing so for months We seem to annoy each other all the time I m not sure we have that much in common and I m not physically attracted to him But I ve previously had two separate relationships that both lasted for 2 years and he treats much better than both my exes I know that he feels strongly for me We also work together so it s easier to continue the relationship for that reason I also really like his family and would miss them a lot if we broke up My family also loves him I ve also grown attached to his cat Even with all the bickering this is still the healthiest relationship I ve been in and I want to make sure that my bpd isn t making me ruin it,Safe/Neutral
Obviously finding a healthy relationship for most people is difficult but having BPD or any mental health issues does add a new dynamic to creating relationships and making sure those close to you can validate and empathize with the internal struggles those with mental health deal with I also generally describe myself as gay and pretty genderqueer genderfluid and have had to work through a lot of trauma that is associated with my sexual orientation and gender identity due to circumstances out of my control I was in a Dialectical Behavioral Therapy group for a year and have been doing 1 on 1 therapy for several years particularly during high school college and right after I dropped out I feel that my understanding of my diagnosis with the skills DBT provided has really helped me stand on my own two feet again I Äôd like to try and open myself up to the idea of dating but I feel my mental health sexual orientation and gender identity all play a part in finding someone that is Äúright Äù for me I Äôd like some advice on what other LGBTQIA people and of course Allies with BPD do to make themselves more open to dating and setting themselves up for success when you struggle with mental health issues Queer people already have a smaller pool of individuals to choose from plus with the added emotional disregulation disorder I feel quite limited in my options I know someone will come into my life one day and accept me for who I am but I want to have the tools necessary to make my next relationship not codependent and be open about my emotional state with my significant other Do you possibly use a safe words involving your emotional state to let your partner know if you Äôre starting down the rabbit hole How early did you bring up your diagnosis if at all during a relationship that Äôs starting to form üíï thank you for reading and any replies are greatly appreciated,Safe/Neutral

I m pretty tired of going through harmless posts on reddit and someone just randomly saying the girl in question on the post probably has BPD when A literally nothing showed traits of her having bpd Like the most recent one I saw was probably a fake post about a girl who has a cozy online only relationship with this guy but said she will be moving in w her irl boyfriend after her mom kicks her out A random commenter decided to say she probably has bpd IDK about you guys but I haven t had an irl boyfriend and a online boyfriend at the same time nor have I heard about that being in the diagnostics for BPD It s so randomly hurtful to come across these stupid and hurtful and really uninformed comments by people that probably were either dumped by a girl with diagnosed BPD or more commonly they were dumped by someone who was awful so they ASSUME they have bpd and now every girl that sucks probably has bpd in their minds,Safe/Neutral

Just wondering if people have any sorta feelings about the diagnosis being called borderline personality disorder vs emotionally unstable personality disorder I know the term borderline personality disorder originated because doctors believed that patients bordered between neurosis which is the poor ability to adapt to ones environment and inability to change ones life Äôs patterns and psychosis which is an impaired relationship with reality I Äôm not sure which one I prefer to be honest EUPD kinda feels a bit like a personal attack but my boyfriend thought it seemed more accurate than BPD Anyways just curious what people Äôs thoughts are thanks,Safe/Neutral

My partner has a few patterns that really confuse me Ä I Äôm curious if this resonates with anyone and how to handle them correctly 1 Connecting two unrelated events from different time periods Something they saw on my phone in passing a month ago and statement I made a month later and connecting them together into a narrative that is logical on the surface but easily full of holes Ä cue long discussions that go no where 2 Mind reading my intent accusing of me certain intentions and why I do things then insisting on them even when I point out I don Äôt feel this way Ä and if I point out that Äôs not how I feel they say I Äôm gas lighting 3 Having a very selective memory where they Äôll recall something that Äôs either half true out of context or missing a crucial details or things that are flat out not their response at the time Like things in writing that happened over text 4 Hyper sensitivity that is difficult to predictZ Let Äôs say we Äôre having a convo I Äôll tease them or give them a ribbing they Äôll laugh and even tease back and play along then the next day they Äôll come back after having thought about it very hurt and angry at me for saying something that in no way was indicated to me was offensive It makes it very confusing what Äôs okay and not okay and what lines are not okay to cross Does this type of behavior resonate with anyone Is it bpd related or just specific to my partner How should I handle it I Äôm really trying to learn,Safe/Neutral

Hi there everyone hope you re all well So today I kind of want to know more about being being in relationship with someone who has BPD I ve been seeing this girl for a few months now and I ve really fallen in love with her and she says she has with me too I ll be honest I ve never fallen for someone like this before and I ve had a few relationships prior something she has also said about me From the start she has been open about suffering with BPD for quite a while something that has never bothered me really At the start of our relationship we fell for each other very quickly and it was certainly very cute and romantic We still have these moments now but occasionally she can have episodes of being almost apathetic and this can last up to a week or so and then she d go back to the person I got to know again But when she does get like that I ts like she does not love me at all and I almost feel like an inconvenience She also has episodes of feeling like she is being abandoned or that I will break up with her On these occasions I always reassure her that is not what I intend to do and am aware this is a major aspect of BPD But what took my by suprise was the episodes of apathy it s like she just does not care about me when she goes into one It does bother me sometimes as I am very sensitive person who likes to give a lot of love to whoever I am seeing So when it isn t reciprocated I can get insecure or upset and times I have read up on BPD a bit and although correct me if I have misinterpreted this under the understanding that those who suffer with it fall for people very quickly as if it s love and then the relationship eventually breaks up a short while after Does this happen and does that imply my GF does not actually love me in the conventional sense If any of this causes offence by the way I am very sorry but don t have much experience with dealing with this and only heard things off others So what I want to know is this part of BPD How do I deal with it properly and is there anything else I should expect I really love her and I just want to make sure I do things right around her Thank you for reading this,Safe/Neutral

I recently participated in a Stanford study looking into how the ketogenic diet affects schizophrenic and bipolar individuals across a 4 month period The consensus so far is as long as you refrain from and other substances that affect your brain balance significantly like caffeine and nicotine while being strict on the food plan you can get a significant improvement on your mood symptoms amp x200B Reason I say this is because I found out I was misdiagnosed with bipolar 2 and I m actually a pwBPD but still found the significant benefits as seen in what is described above Only difference is that its a lot easier to calm down from mood swings and they are in less severity duration with more mental clarity While also fixing my binge eating urges for the most part for some reason my brain can t tell itself its full when it comes to carbs and sugar but with fat it somehow can read that amp x200B The results from the study so far are very positive with high success rates which is awesome considering its a larger group study compared to past studies on this topic There is also an identical study planned in Europe starting sometime later this year Given the success continues it can be transformative in mental health treatment amp x200B I can talk about Ketosis for hours but that s a brief summery on what brings on the question of how Strict Ketosis has done for you Did you do it while not using any other substances like drugs nicotine and caffeine,Safe/Neutral

To preface this I ve been diagnosed with BPD for over three years It s been a difficult journey I m not trying to perpetuate any of the stigma with any of what I m about to say amp x200B I m sure we re all at least somewhat aware of the kind of posts or comments I m referencing Many of us struggle with romantic relationships and will post here about it I just want to say this isn t meant to invalidate anyone s feelings or make anyone feel like a bad person but with BPD relationships really can bring out the worst in us I ve seen countless comments on threads where someone mentions struggles in their relationship instantly siding with the OP disregarding any unhealthy behaviour on their part and calling their SO toxic manipulative gaslighting and calling on them to break up WE DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE PEOPLE OR THE SITUATION BEYOND ONE PERSON S SIDE We can t give unbiased advice or opinions We can t know the objective truth And so many people here act like not respecting your partner s friend s whatever boundaries exploding on them yelling being obsessive stalking them being controlling etc is normal because they re my FP IT IS NOT NORMAL OR OKAY I know it s not our fault and we can t always control it I ve been toxic in the past I ve been manipulative It was a hard pill to swallow but I had to admit that to myself to be able to grow as a person It wasn t my fault I didn t choose to have BPD I couldn t always control it But I had to take responsibility for my actions and behaviour and admit to myself that it wasn t normal or okay or excusable by saying they re my FP I have BPD I can t help it We can t always help it but enabling each other isn t going to help us further our recovery towards being a healthy functional human being who can cope with their thoughts and behaviours I realise that many aren t at that point where they re ready to make that step but please for the love of God stop making every calling out of unhealthy behaviour perpetuating the stigma and invalidating It might be an explanation but it isn t an excuse amp x200B Again I want to close this by saying none of this is meant to be read in a way to make anyone feel bad about themselves or their behaviour We all know how hard it is to live with BPD and how easy it is to spiral out of control and how important it is that we forgive ourselves for making mistakes and realise they don t define us to be able to grow,Safe/Neutral
Just something I ve been thinking about since most of the differences between the two disorders seem behavioural rather than a fundamental difference in the overarching symptoms or causes E g people with CPTSD show less impulsive and self destructive behaviour and find it easier to function in relationships than those with BPD But it s still common to have mood swing psychotic symptoms feeling of emptiness etc in both Any thoughts or links to research would be greatly appreciated,Safe/Neutral
I Äôve noticed that under pretty much every post that looks for support and advice especially when it comes to relationships of any kind with other people commenters are so quick to enable splitting behaviors I don Äôt just mean supporting OPs or telling them their feelings are valid they are But more and more comments I see are trying to pathologize and moralize other people Äôs friends and partners without the whole story This seems especially out of place when the OP admits they are splitting if we know someone else is splitting why would we try to get them to double down on it Obviously some of this is just par for the course when asking for advice from other folks with BPD but i still feel like we have a responsibility to try to do no harm and I notice more and more upvote downvote wars over this kind of thing TLDR is there too much projecting and enabling of splitting in comments these days,Safe/Neutral

I ve actually known this one for a while but this came up recently in discussion So BPD is a COMBINATION of a naturally highly emotionally personality with a failure to learn coping mechanisms to manage them especially during childhood adolescence when most people learn those coping mechanisms There s actually a ton of super emotional people out there who did learn effective coping mechanisms as children One example is people who do a shit ton of scrapbooking or make pinterest boards or those magazine clipping vision boards I feel like that kind of person often gets a bad rap and it s kind of something people associate with middle aged housewives Here s the thing though They re using it to express their individuality and hold onto their sense of self It s a coping mechanism You could learn something from them Anyway that s tonight s rant,Safe/Neutral

Does anyone else get irrationally angry if there Äôs significant other with some self first or doesn Äôt sacrifice for you or your family like pets or whatever I thought myself going into a rage if let Äôs say we Äôre in a rush to go somewhere and we have to walk the dog and give him some time before the week so I come downstairs and like eat a quick granola bar or something so I can give our dog some time and I ask him to grab something quick and take over so I can shower so we can leave and he tells me he has to have a Äòreal breakfast Äô because he Äôs hungry and proceeds to take 20 mins to make himself eggs and potatoes then sits there eating for another 20 making us extremely late and putting me out because I now have no time to shower or get ready Is this a common thing Because I sometimes feel like a jerk for basically telling him not to take care of himself but makes me irrationally angry when I have to sacrifice for things myself and the other person takes liberties to be self centered or not sacrifice themselves it Äôs like can Äôt you just eat a granola bar like I did so we can give time to the dog and I can actually shower Or other times he will insist on ironing for the stupidest thing like goimf to the park ÄòOh but this t shirt or shorts are so wrinkled Äô I tell him we Äôre in a rush we don Äôt have time for this just sacrifice this one time no one cares if your clothes are perfectly pressed nd he goes on that he Äôs not a slob like me and actually wants to look presentable to me it comes off as just being a pompous selfish jerk Does anyone go through this,Safe/Neutral

Hi everyone I Äôve not made a post on Reddit before but I Äôm starting to get frustrated and desperate Just some context I Äôve been with my girlfriend for the best part of 3 years She has BPD and is constantly on ups and downs I Äôve learnt to sort of deal with it but I Äôm not a professional by any stretch and I often find it hard to help her She Äôs been through the doctors 3 times whilst we Äôve been together which I think is incredibly brave given how she Äôs been treated Each time she was told her symptoms were down to Äúanxiety and low mood Äù or Äúshe Äôs still growing up Äù she Äôs 21in October which seems to be a common theme with the NHS and Mental Health issues prescribe some shitty medication and send her away She Äôs also gone private though they can Äôt help much as she hasn Äôt been formally diagnosed and private therapy is incredibly expensive and we don Äôt have bags of money to spend I think what I Äôm asking for is any tips on helping her even in little ways as well as possible avenues we can take to get her diagnosed and treat by a professional as she Äôs been completely fobbed off by everyone she has spoken to as of yet Any advice at all would be great Thanks in advance,Safe/Neutral

Recently my friend mentioned she thinks she has BPD A lot of her actions align with symptoms and I want her to reach out for help A difficulty at the moment is that she is in a codependent relationship by her own admission Right now they are stable but for months until recently she was deeply upset as her long term bf had been really shitty towards her Things like emotional infidelity telling her he hates her laughing at her expressing her feelings At one point she was serious about leaving him I think a lot of her self esteem and happiness comes from whether her relationship is stable I really think that because she feels happy in her relationship and therefore happy with herself now she Äôs dismissing how she felt then I asked if she had called someone to discuss BPD following on from the conversation about it that we had last month She said she doesn Äôt feel she needs to because she feels good right now I strongly think she should as I don Äôt think how she feels now will last I care about her a lot and don Äôt want to see her so distraught again So I Äôm going to have another conversation and really encourage her to reach out Does anyone have any guidance on how best to approach this I like to think I am emotionally intelligent but I can always learn more about BPD I will speak to her with care reassure her that I Äôm not upset with her and show that I only want the best for her I will also listen and stay patient but ultimately I really want her to get help and may have to be persistent with my encouragement I Äôm not sure if this will be helpful though My friend is a wonderful human being who I am so grateful to have met I hope everyone reading this too realises they are good enough and capable of living amazing lives even if it doesn Äôt always feel like it,Safe/Neutral
Up to this day I Äôm kinda confused why my friend was ignored by a wedding he got invited to He was very close to the bride prior to the wedding they were colleagues and he was her supervisor of some sort This two literally text daily it made me wonder how her fianc e was taking it because the texts would go from morning like the moment she wakes up and can last up to 8 to 10 so it appears neither one has boundaries when it comes to texts or they don Äôt feel there needs to be one So the closeness started September last year and is still ongoing now The wedding happened a few days ago and I was stunned that her first reaction to seeing him while she was standing beside her groom in her dress was Äúoh hey I didn Äôt recognize you with the glasses Äù That was about it I thought that was strange and my friend looked a little confused too Bride didn Äôt introduce him to the groom despite my friend saying he wants to us dinner with them that kinda thing makes me think they were close but at the wedding the bride seemed like she didn Äôt want to be associated with my friend My friend didn Äôt grow up rich and so he brought me there as his plus one saying Äúyou have the upbringing to help me navigate their social class Äù It was a very upper crust group like old money and even for me it was a hard table to work on I had to pull every card I had lol We had to ambush her during a photo session just so he can introduce me to her She gave me a hug and told us Äúsorry guys I have to check with the other guests Äù At the reception I was already drunk and having fun with my steak Bride never looked at us anymore after the intro at the photo session The entire night he was texting her like how he usually does when he Äôs at home I felt kinda sad for him He was also lost on what topics to talk about and ended up talking about gophers which is really not something you talk about during these events Anyway it seemed like she was literally avoiding us facing the other way sometimes I also saw her look at me and she never asked how I was or that she was happy to meet me Nothing The wedding was kinda expensive so it didn Äôt make sense why she ignored us We had to go home without saying goodbye My friend never met the husband My friend posted on his Facebook wall pics of the wedding and tagged the bride and groom She responded like how she usually does and if I Äôm not mistaken they are carrying on and texting as usual now she Äôs married and on her honeymoon lol What gives I Äôm confused at this I go to a lot of weddings this is my friends second wedding invite he Äôs not a popular guy Thoughts Please don Äôt be mean thank you üôè TLDR my friend was snubbed by a wedding he went to by the person who invited him,Safe/Neutral

I m trying to gather good ways to calm down when I m upset A lot of things make me upset From perceiving hostility contempt in others words tone loud low pitch noises being ignored feeling as if I don t know what to do etc I find that it s very important to know how to calm down especially when I don t know it instinctively If I don t do anything consciously I usually end up stressed out for hours or even days which burns me out and usually makes the real world problems even worse So how do you calm yourself down What are your best techniques For me this is a short list of things that work for me calm music usually classical piano or harp laying down and consciously relaxing all the muscles in my body focusing on my environment explicitly trying to describe it in my head this one I learned in therapy and it s really hard to perform when upset but very effective,Safe/Neutral
We borderlines tend to make situations go from minor to serious and even life threatening at times I think this behavior comes from the belief that as adults all our problems are serious and need to be handled in such a way However this isn t true not for us or anyone Big feelings are not always big situations amp x200B Let s say for example your partner did something minor that triggered a big feeling In this scenario your partner promised you that they will pick you up from the gym which takes 5 minutes however they are playing a long video game at home You get annoyed because now you have to wait way longer you told them you had to sleep early tonight but they made you aware they were playing a game earlier but you didn t know they couldn t pause it and you had to wait for them to finish You are now upset your brain told you see they would rather play a game and leave you waiting they know you had to sleep early they don t care about your needs they lied to you gt Cue big feelings Although you re upset this is entirely a miscommunication error as your partner assumed when they told they are playing a game that you had to wait till they finish a round You did not There are a few ways to cope with this amp x200B OPTION A TAKING YOUR EMOTIONS SERIOUSLY You I know you said that but you could ve told me you had to wait that felt like important information Partner Yea my bad Is it alright for you to wait longer You I feel really upset right now I just want to cry Just feels like you didn t care enough about me to drop the game and come by I told you I had to sleep earlier and you could ve told me about the game Partner I m sorry but I have to finish this game Are you feeling ok You NO I feel awful I know it s not okay for me to feel this way but I can t help it You thinking great I m throwing a fit and stressing them out why do I feel this way I told them but both of us are feeling like shit now Now both people are stressed out you are gaslighting yourself with negative self talk Commence the spiral You are attending to your feelings but it seems like it made matters worse amp x200B OPTION B Partner I mean it s just an extra 40 minutes you can t wait a little longer You thinking Great they re right why am I making this such a big deal I m so mentally ill and fucking toxic I need to suck it up You I guess I can You are stressed out your partner is not but they are not aware that they hurt your feelings You are not attending to your feelings and neither is your partner How do you think this is going to play out Cue the splitting amp x200B OPTION C USING COMEDY ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR FEELINGS BUT BEING AWARE You You said you d be here and I have to wait a whole hour Partner Yea this round is going to take that long sorry I m going to come as soon as it s done You But you didn t tell me it would take that long and I have to make sure I sleep early today Partner Sorry I didnt tell you that but if you wanted to leave now you needed to tell me an hour earlier You No u dont care about me u didnt even bother to read my mind and u shouldve known to come earlier Partner LOL honey I will come please next time just tell me an hour earlier You hmph amp x200B Now what happens here is that 1 you attended your feelings 2 addressed what giant beliefs are triggering those feelings they don t care about me that are triggering a giant reaction 3 You analyze your beliefs and you are aware that those beliefs aren t true they still care about me I just need to notify an hour earlier 4 you are using satire to let your partner know hey I am upset right now it felt like you didn t care about me but i know you still do Light situations call for light hearted solutions amp x200B Remember you can still handle this situation seriously in a healthy manner but I wanted to show how comedy can be very effective Remember if you do not feel better after using this then you still need to try other forms of coping Simple requests such as reassurance hugs or having your partner do acts of care have them pick up food for you on the way is fine amp x200B Borderline feelings often means you ll react largely towards small moments It s inevitable that we are drama queens kings but instead of pretending we re not or making every moment dramatic allow humor to make it light hearted Your partner can easily comfort you and feel less stressed out since the situation is not heavy amp x200B Remember in times of situations where it can be stressful heavy and hard it is also the same opportunities of where it can be a moment that heals you and bonds you and your partner closer,Safe/Neutral

Yesterday I made a post on here about how I got rejected by a guy I d been dating briefly Thank you for the enormous amount of support I got that absolutely made my day The guy and are both recovering addicts in 12 step programs I ve been clean for nearly 2 and a half years and yesterday I asked the guy if he wanted to continue dating which he did not I d expected to get a panic attack and freak out to the point that I wanted to relapse It was actually the opposite that happened and I was really quite surprised because it s very unlike that drama queen that I usually am used to be This was yesterday so I was afraid that maybe the lighthearted reaction was only an initial reaction and that the heartbreak would come later I did feel a little uneasy last night but practicing some mindfulness greatly reduced the anxiety I slept quite well last night and slept in relatively long So I must say that I had quite a good night s sleep despite having been turned down I m completely clean by the way not on any prescription meds either and I don t smoke Although I did drink a little more coffee than I usually do Today I went to an AA meeting to share about it this is my 6th meeting this week I usually do 4 meetings per week but this week I m trying to do a little more because of this stressful situation I shared my story at a meeting Although we re not allowed to cross share a guy shared that he d been through a similar experience when he d been sober for a while he too had been dumped and he was waiting to be crushed by heartbreak He said that he actually subconsciously loved situations that he could freak out over and relapse over But once in recovery he was like ah oh well I guess it just wasn t meant to be Very similarly to my reaction The same guy also shared that last week he d had an argument with a friend and because they both expressed their emotions their friendship was restored In the past he would have walked away angrily and would have never wanted to see that other person again So yeah here I am a day later I ve had a good night s sleep and I know that life goes on I don t have to relapse over anything,Safe/Neutral

My attachment style is avoidant secure and hers is extremely anxious That means that giving reassurance over and over again someone feeling possessive or insecure about me or someone clinging to me will instantly give me the ick and I pull away Hers is very anxious so she needs a ton of reassurance is bothered when I do things that don Äôt include her and is glued to my side in any public setting This has been a point of contention in our relationship for years There is no bad guy just two well meaning people that love each other but have very conflicting needs For example when we are invited to a party she wants to go with me because she has social anxiety and is very introverted but then disappears into a corner and wants to leave if I interact with other people I am extreme extroverted and seek out people to talk to and don Äôt like to focus all my energy on one person and I definitely don Äôt want to leave This results in her pestering me to leave and getting increasingly upset when I finally do I Äôm all Icked out by the clinginess but she desperately needs reassurance from me which in that moment I have no capacity to give Two years ago we realized this was never going to work and started working very hard on fixing our relationship dynamic Me not feeling resentful when she absorbs me whole and her not feeling resentful when I pull away It took a lot of therapy but the last year has been the best year of our friendship ever,Safe/Neutral

I know this post may upset some people but I ve gotta say it Having an FP isn t healthy The way we throw the term around The way we casually drop it with all its meaning as if it s commonplace which it is among us It isn t healthy How many posts on here are people considering or actually harming themselves because of an FP Because they ve fallen out Because they re not returning their calls Sometimes because of minor situations I know we crave connection I know we crave affection I know we crave validation But putting all of that emotional neediness into a single person who sometimes hasn t even asked for the responsibility is both selfish and dangerous It is harmful to have an FP especially if you re not in an emotionally stable place I gave up on FPs last year That s not to say I cut anyone out of my life I just keep a certain level of distance now If I notice myself starting to obsess or crave a particular person s attention too much I back off I hang out with other friends I wait a day to respond to texts I ve been so much happier and healthier now that no single individual is responsible for my emotions If I could give a single piece of advice to everyone here Please consider how many times an FP has caused you hurt whether through their actions or yours You don t need an FP to have a fulfilling existence,Safe/Neutral
I got rejected by a guy but I m still clean and sober and didn t relapse over it I m a 29F former addict and alcoholic I ve been clean for 2 years and 3 months now The main reason I used and drank was because of relationship insecurities Lately I had a very short but very intense fling with a guy I d vaguely known him for about 6 months but last month I practically lived with him for the whole week Lots of intimacy and messages with heart emojis After a week that all stopped We still saw each other through some events with mutual friends and acquaintances But we ignored each other Then today I opened up about my feelings and asked him if he wanted to continue dating He said he didn t In a very respectful way In the past this would have made me go completely insane I d have gotten depressed about this and would have been unable to deal with my emotions sober This time around though I don t feel sad at all I felt a little empty at first but now all I feel is joy I literally just danced in my living room and called people up to say how happy I am In the past this most certainly would have been something for me to drink or use over I m so proud of all the progress I ve made,Safe/Neutral

I ve always known having a FP is unhealthy at least when it comes to me and my BPD Asking that much of someone Putting that pressure on them Being that vulnerable It s not good for us for them for anyone involved I ve spent this year distancing myself from anyone I ever considered a FP Not in a I m going to cut you out completely BPD meltdown kind of way But naturally Hanging out less Not making as many plans Seeing them while I m already out rather than planning to meet them specifically And you know what happened I ve been a lot more emotionally stable I ve fostered more friendships than I ever have I have drinking buddies Dinner buddies I m no longer sitting around waiting for my FP to finish work or spending 3 days indoors eagerly awaiting the day I get to see FP I ve also managed to start a romantic relationship No FP taking up all my time And no my BF hasn t become my FP I have no desire to obsess like that ever again And building this relationship slowly without confiding everything or digging up everything about the other person immediately has been nice I feel like I m actually making a connection not speeding down a highway in hopes of getting to some finish line before it s too late There s no rush No pressure Just each day as it comes The way I see it addictive tendencies come hand in hand with us right I think I kicked my FP addiction because that s what it was Whatever chemicals having an FP let loose in my brain no longer seem as enticing as being in control No one person can set me off anymore No one person has that kind of sometimes not asked for power over me anymore And now I ve seen what life can be like without an FP I don t want to go back,Safe/Neutral

Long story short my friend is about 30 years old and exhibits many BPD traits In the past she has expressed concern that she suffers from it but has never been diagnosed Her impulsivity and tendency to Äòsplit Äô has wreaked havoc in her life but she has elaborate explanations for why these actions are justified and necessary I want to help her find more balance and get more out of life but I worry that bringing this up again in the wrong way will make her feel attacked and rejected Is this something I can should try to help her with or would it be better to continue to validate and be there for her and wait for her to seek help on her own,Safe/Neutral
Idk if this is a BPD thing or something else entirely but sometimes I just don t feel like acting like a normal person I just kind of shut off any unnecessary social normalities because I just don t care about appearing to be normal for the day or possibly even longer I know that with BPD mimicry is a common thing a lot of us learn to be like other people to fit in more but sometimes I just stop caring and revert to what a nt person might consider almost like a hollow shell I still have my interests and I m still feeling things but I just don t feel a particular need or desire to display that on the outside,Safe/Neutral

I 22F want to first say that I am not yet in remission but my therapist says I m getting so much better since when I first started seeing her in August I am notorious for never having stable romantic relationships I ve always felt this underlying obsession toward whatever guy I m with and it usually scares them off or causes them to be disinterested because I get frustrated that they don t match my eagerness and affection However since I ve been getting better things have changed I also started dating my best friend 27M last year He s been in my life since the day I was born literally because he s a close family friend and has been since he was two years old He and I grew really close because we supported each other through a lot of trauma and hurt and after he finally ended his relationship that had been basically already over for the past two years he finally made a move on me and we started dating I ve never been happier I also feel so comfortable and accustomed to everything about him because I ve known him for so long I don t feel the usual unhealthy obsession and take so much comfort in knowing that my love for him is real not just desperation and infatuation because I m afraid he ll leave me He is my favorite person so to speak but he s not an FP for me I feel like this is the first real whole relationship I ve ever had in my entire life because we already have a history of nonjudgment understanding and care for one another s mental emotional needs he struggles with really low self esteem and fear of abandonment himself He matches my energy in our relationship but I also know that I am an individual who doesn t need a person to feel whole I choose to be with him because he enhances my life in ways I cannot by myself I truly love him and have in some way shape form for a long time now I d always said I would do anything for him to be happy I m just so overjoyed that his happiness is found in me I know he loves me and I love him I feel so blessed to be making this much progress in my BPD treatment and well enough to have and maintain a truly healthy relationship ü ü ü,Safe/Neutral

This is a serious question After having a 2 year relationship with a Cluster B person And despite all the trauma it has caused me I don t like the stigma online towards people with Cluster B And I don t like that it s classified as a mental illness To me I see it as a feature a genetic attribute Something like hair color or height Do we call people with red hair ill And give them medicine to fix it I just don t get this need to unify people into a common standard instead of accepting their diversity My exGF was a Cluster B and I know it was hard for both of us But remembering her it was always something I loved about her and I probably would have never fallen in love if she wasn t a pwBPD Please stop the stigma and accept people for who they are,Safe/Neutral

I Äôm really just looking for advice because I don Äôt know what to do anymore My friend got diagnosed with BPD mid last year which explained how she had been acting But it just kept getting worse from there She kept trying to isolate me from my friends and she would spread rumours about me all the time And every time I would confront her about it she would blame her BPD and explain that it was just an episode Things got worse when she started having these angry episodes where she would hit me and eventually she started trying to kill me She kept blaming her episodes but I couldn Äôt get the way she kept laughing at me when she did it out of my head So I left and she stopped coming to school I also sent her an email explaining to her that I couldn Äôt be friends with her anymore because of what she was doing but I don Äôt hate her and I even encouraged her to come back to school She recently started reaching out to some of our former classmates and she Äôs telling them that I told her that she should go kill herself and that I want her dead She also said that I told her and her mum that no one in school likes her and that she should never come back Which is the EXACT opposite of what happened I don Äôt know what to do I feel like if I keep trying to tell people the truth she will get what she wants I Äôm just hurt Because even after everything she did to me I tried my best to understand and yet when I protect myself from her because she kept trying to kill me I become the villain How does that even work Is this normal for a person with BPD or is she just being a bad person,Attacking Behavior
I lie to people I Äôve stolen things I manipulate people I say the rudest things and I never feel bad I Äôm honestly starting to kind I Äôm a psychopath because ever since I was younger I was always like this I Äôve learned what Äôs good and bad and I know better but sometimes Impulses get to me I can literally tell my girlfriend she Äôs got she Äôs not she Äôs super beautiful and always apologize after it come out cause I don Äôt think about what I say and I don Äôt feel bad I don Äôt feel anything ever actually except happiness and anger and soemtimes sadness but still other than that I feel like I don Äôt have a conscious when it comes to doing bad things is this normal among bpd or am I just a psychopath More information I don Äôt feel bad when I hurt someone I just feel bad because of the repercussions of my actions That the only reason I feel bad about anything,Attacking Behavior
I posted about this girl on another account fp blocked me when she found out I was going to residential treatment on April 10th It has been five months without her I messaged her on the one thing she didn t block me on and she manipulated me yet again I followed her around one day at school I ve been trying to give her a letter for days It was like five minutes ago I realized that I don t have an attachment to her anymore I m free It feels so freeing like I can actually breath with everything I feel SO happy and it s not like the euphoric happiness of being with her it s an ACTUAL happiness that doesn t hurt I have come so far and I am just so happy,Attacking Behavior
Hello I just needed a fresh perspective on something that I am seriously considering This is a bit long if you make it to the end thank you for reading As I learn more about bpd and what triggers my episodes I keep coming back to anger and rejection Today I had a bad episode but I Äôm ok now just reflecting tons I do not know what possessed me to do a deep dive into Narcissism and Narcissistic parents and family structures In the past I had suspected that she had such tendencies but as I watched video after video psychologist and psychiatrists describe behaviors and interactions my CPTSD kicked in like crazy in a very insightful way associating a lot of the different points discussed in the videos with my life experiences For example Narcissist parents tell you your efforts are not enough and they always belittle you This immediately triggered a memory of my mom telling me I was a stupid lazy bum that was a shame for her among the other moms of the parents association to have a daughter like me Many more obscure and painful memories came out through my obsession with understanding where does all this chaos comes from In the midst of all of this research I came across a video that talks about questions Narcissists can not answer because of their arrogant deceitful and manipulative ways They are very open ended questions that relate directly to her abuse and neglect My mom has a lot of issues and she never misses and opportunity to make you feel like shit if she really wants to They day I told both of my parents about being diagnosed with BPD CPTSD Depression and Anxiety Disorder she remained quiet during the talk but afterwards started mocking me and the fact that people experience depression as nonsense to put it politely she wasn Äôt Everything seems to come back to her and my childhood and I want to take power back I am going to talk with my therapist about confronting my mother this way in my next session but I was wondering what other unbiased people think about the situation Here is another thing she did to me that completely broke me to my core I was sexually abused by my cousin when I was 7 years old I never told anyone until I became an adult About 5 people know this about me including my mother When I told her about it she just said so what that happens to other people and it Äôs not the end of the world I used to sit on my uncles lap and that is weird That was her response This incident happened at our home and that didn Äôt even move her in the slightest bit I also struggle to conceive and I want nothing more in this world than to be a mom I have had several miscarriages and I have told her about them When we talk about this difficulty of mine to get pregnant she cannot stop talking about when she was pregnant completely dismissing the fact that I need to be heard because I hurt so bad So now that you have a bit more detail background to my story do you think I should do this,Attacking Behavior
This was about 3 and a half almost 4 years ago now but here we go So to start my ex best friend was my favorite person for a while I did everything to appease her I cared so much about her and I let her treat me like crap because I loved her But when I met my now boyfriend I realized how friends are supposed to treat you That prompted me to go to therapy and discuss my unhealthy attachment to her and I was diagnosed with BPD shortly after After he and I started developing romantic feelings for each other I started drifting away from her more Our friendship was finally being exposed for what it was and we fought continuously for about a year after I came to the realization She attempted to tear him and I apart gaslit both of us told both of us that we said things about each other that we never said which caused us to break up for a while I got re attached and started listening to her BS again until I finally started reconnecting with my boyfriend on our own terms We got back together and we have had an incredibly healthy and loving relationship since then When we got back together she didn Äôt like it She started punishing me by excluding me from things she would make fun of him any time she could and I eventually cut ties with her after I graduated from high school That is kind of the sum up of everything Now the thing that bugs me is that she is still in contact with some of my boyfriends more distant friends so I hear about her occasionally from them My boyfriend hates hearing about her and he tells them to stop telling both of us about her life because he doesn Äôt like how awful she was to me Every time she Äôs brought up I feel re traumatized Here Äôs the problem I associate him with her because we were a trio for a while when we were all friends She credited herself as the reason we got together and I did too for a long time It came out when we had some talks with my bf and his friends that my boyfriend knew she liked him for a while and that she was angry and jealous when we got together He distanced himself from her after he started developing feelings for me and since her and I stopped being friends she is blaming me for Äústealing Äù her friend group claiming that I lie about her constantly and makes things up about me to ruin my reputation My previous attachment to her is affecting my relationship and she has reinforced the belief that I Äôm a psycho with BPD who does nothing but lie manipulate cheat and ruin peoples lives within myself and other people that I used to consider really good friends back in high school believe it now too I hate that I give her that much power but every single time she is brought up I split and start an argument with my boyfriend and it ruins the entire day Do you guys have any advice on how to deal with this I Äôve talked about this extensively with my therapist and I am doing my DBT workbooks but nothing is helping I feel lost,Attacking Behavior
Did anyone else have a similar experience Until I was 14 years old and my dad finally allowed me to go to a salon my bpd mom would cut my hair to a pageboy cut when she would get drunk I would always beg her to please let my hair grow but she didn Äôt care She would tell me to stand very still so she wouldn Äôt cut me and when she accidentally would scratch me with the scissors since she was very drunk I had to pretend I was fine or she would pull my hair to make me shut up and let her finish or it would be my fault if it was messed up It was so awful that in fifth grade my dad was shaving my brother Äôs head over summer break and I asked him to shave mine too Everyone thought I had cancer but I was relieved that my mom couldn Äôt cut my hair while it grew back Sadly I got bullied for both the pageboy cut and my hair being really short when I went back to school I Äôm still like super sensitive about my hair and cry and get depressed if I get a bad cut or dye job Like to the point that I start hating myself I Äôve even dyed my hair purple and purple to mask a bad balayage that turner my hair orange 300 later Every time I looked in the mirror I felt like I just wanted to crawl in a hole and die I Äôm sure a lot of us pwbpd also had bpd moms Did anyone have a similar type of trauma Have you found a way not to let it affect you so badly,Attacking Behavior
Okay the title sounds weird I don Äôt ACTUALLY bully my friends or s o but it comes off as bullying I lack Äúsensitivity Äù and I usually clown on my friends out of fun I always expect them to return it and I never get offended when they say something since I know they Äôre my people and of course they didn Äôt mean it just how I didn Äôt mean it They do get offended sometimes since apparently I don Äôt know when to stop and what exactly is Äútoo much Äù This occurs mostly in group settings when I Äôm alone with one of them I don Äôt act like that I have no idea why I do this which is why I Äôm asking if this is a BPD thing It makes me feel really shitty when they tell me that I hurt them when I was just joking without any malicious intent I want to stop doing that but I don Äôt know how since I can Äôt distinguish what Äôs Äútoo much Äù and what isn Äôt,Attacking Behavior

I apologize for the length of this post in advance I f31 started talking to my ex m29 again after we had a nasty falling out in which I use the mutual decision to terminate a pregnancy as a means to devalue him dramatically He typically feeds off of my crave and I was giving a lot to him but I never felt as if it was reciprocated It was almost if I was taking him to notice me when he had been there all along However he was also nasty to me and treated me like an obligation instead of a relationship So I ended up writing him a letter saying how I thought he was immature and emotionally deaf and he was never there He became extremely angry and took it as an outright attack Not only did he humiliate me by yelling at me on the sidewalk in our quiet neighborhood but he also cut me off for a total of six months I had a nasty 6 month mental break down which resulted in me losing my job and pretty much not doing any coursework for 15 credits worth of classes What Äôs more is that while he cut me off for what I percived to be permanently I knew that it wasn Äôt He would reach out and do things to gain my validation like asked me what made him so special that he was so attached to him even though he was rejecting me Only to put me down after he got the answer At one point he even reached out to me and when I asked to see him he said he just wants to Äúhelp me cope with him no longer being there Äù it was one of the most humiliating things I had to deal with during my mental breakdown It Äôs like he was seeking to rub me into the ground more However I was still so desperately attached to him and eager to make things right So when he offered to start a sexual relationship again I jumped at the chance Now I worry that I may have put myself in a position to fall through that break down again I see him sparingly and we have discussed the terms of the relationship this time He is dating multiple people I am not as I Äôm still scarred from what he did I do speak to other time but nothing that I Äôm gonna pursue down the line We sleep together at least once a week He went from reaching out to me only for that purpose on that day to reaching out a few days before that and two days after and most recently for three days after which was shocking to me because I really like routine And I was getting used to him talking to me only two days after This gave me a false sense of hope that he was reattaching but now I literally haven Äôt heard from him in nearly a week as of this Wednesday I don Äôt want to impose on him I did make a light request for more time from him and he said he would try For a minute it seems like things are looking up and then this started happening I feel like I Äôm literally on the brink of freaking out and crying and screaming I have shut off my phone and I do not intend to use it for the rest of the week I just don Äôt want to write anything to him really nasty especially since I nearly split on him the other day and I was lucky to catch it in real time before I made the mistake However I can Äôt help but feel like this whole thing was a bad idea to start over I want so badly to wean myself off of him I just don Äôt know how to begin I don Äôt know how i Äôll manage if I never hear from him never see him smiling again never making him laugh But I also am tired of being an afterthought and I Äôm sick of the abuse of freedom has in our current relationship it seem so logical and I knew that we have the perfect cell But now I Äôm worried that I may have literally jeopardized all of my heart work and progress Does anyone know how to cope for real How do you start separate yourself from somebody who is abusing your status as an fp especially if they are knowledgeable about how central they are to your life I practice mindfulness and I am well aware that this me the end But I can Äôt help my feelings Some advice would really be appreciated tl dr my toxic ex caused my mental breakdown lasting six months and I lost everything but I Äôm sleeping with him again and his behavior is putting me at risk for another one How do I separate myself without breaking down over the loss of the relationship,Attacking Behavior

We had an amazing few months before we had a couple of fights that got exacerbated by my BPD Last Thursday we were talking after I had a stressful week of taking my dad to the ER the first time in his 82 years We were supposed to go to a 2 day festival and she had given her friend my ticket because we were still arguing prior and I had blocked her as a defense mechanism the previous week and she didn t want to go alone I tried to accept it said something negative about her friend which she had not named so I painted the worst picture in my head it was a mutual friend of ours and she took it personal and hung up on me That s when I split and went into a 3 hour rampage I sent her the worst text messages voice messages a human should never hear I brought up every single insecurity she ever revealed to me and used it against her I even made a post make fun of her passive aggressively She never responded to any of it The next day day 1 of the festival I went ahead and bought myself my own new ticket and went by myself I drove the 2 hours by myself and walked miles to the venue I saw her for a split second within the first 30 minutes of arriving for the 9 hour evening I saw her turn to me and I turned away and ran into the crowd I didn t want to upset her I wanted to apologize but I also didn t want to ruin her time I stayed at the festival pretty late left by myself and went home Texted her That was 1am on Saturday The last few days I ve been mulling over it just wanting to apologize to her just wanting her to know she is not the things I called her That it was the monster I ve been trying to fight my entire life inside of me that said those things Not me Not my heart I don t think anyone should have to deal with such verbal abuse I m proud of her in a lot of ways for not putting up with it and truly blocking me I spent the last 14 months unemployed I completed about 9 months of retraining into a new field and started my new job today I love it My boss was playing music that they played at the festival while he was training me It made me miss her even more I wanted to tell her I love my new job It fits my personality very well and it s what I m good at The new environment is also psychologically good for me She was so excited when I got the offer 2 weeks ago The festival was supposed to be part of that celebration Right now I m running a data recover program on my PC to try to get back the pictures of her I deleted during that 3 hour rage last Thursday I miss her face so much She s so beautiful I also saw she hadn t blocked me on Twitter so I sent her a message a few hours ago I just bought the BPD Workbook by Dr Fox and am about 25 through it It s helping so far I wish I started it sooner I m excited to do more of it and learn more about how I can tame that monster that is my BPD I m looking forward to my second day of work tomorrow I m not looking forward to not being able to tell her about it Or not knowing how her day was Missing her hurts me I m sorry Alex I love you Alex,Attacking Behavior
I might have faulty or paranoid perceptions and then behave in an emotionally charged way fora short time but my ex there Äôs kids between us consistently speaks to me with abusive language and I Äôm just now realizing this I think I might have been the volatile one in the relationship to some extent but I know I felt nothing I did was ever good enough for them This was pointed out to me over and over I became hyper sensitive to perceived criticism Of course I was paranoid and scared of abandonment or cheating when no effort I made was ever satisfactory they would talk to others but not me and when I would share my perspective or confront them I was told that I was just crazy They told others I am just crazy They would plan with others telling them it Äôs because I Äôm crazy and then withhold intimacy until I would agree with their plans in a marriage They work in mental health and consistently scream literally scream without me raising my voice that I Äôm crazy and everyone knows it That they will call me names because I deserve them My kids have had to ask them to stop screaming at me and that breaks my heart But they have the more socially favorable profession and they are the gender favored as victims by society and they have said probably publicly I am the abuser Well if I am the abuser how come I went to therapy and did DBT and am still being screamed at and called crazy for having any self interest whatsoever Did I get mental help to be criticized for getting mental help So I Äôm the abuser but they can control the schedule make threats and say their not threats their promises they can say they Äôll take my kids they can scream that everybody thinks I Äôm horrible and everyone knows I Äôm crazy they can threaten to burn down my life verbatim and that I deserve to be spoken to this way This isn Äôt even touching on what I do for them and our children with is more financially and equal with time because I Äôm not interested in a comparison Just a rant about my realization of what the word Äúoverbearing Äù means and what Äúverbal abuse Äù actually looks like All this time I thought I was just unstable and didn Äôt deserve love but now I Äôm starting to question some of that,Attacking Behavior
i Äôve mentioned him on this sub before but after consideration i Äôm starting to think he may have also had bpd and it Äôs making me rethink a lot of things if i know that maybe he felt what i do then i may come to terms with it better he had some trauma as a kid and said that it affected his emotional capacity as an adult he thought he liked me for years as best friends and even manipulated the breakup between me and my previous ex his best friend because he Äòliked Äô me and wanted me however when we were dating he decided he didn Äôt love me but didn Äôt want to leave me because he thought he could make himself love me and because he felt guilty he stated he cannot process love and most emotions like normal people and whenever i caught him staring blankly it Äôs because his facade slipped apparently everything i thought i knew was this Äúchill skater boy Äù facade he Äôd crafted and in reality he Äôs just an emotionless shell apparently he did genuinely care about me just not in that way and only one other person but that Äôs it didn Äôt consistently or deeply care about anyone else and pretended to in order to feel normal and human the parties he went to were just a last ditch effort to try and feel normal and i noticed one week he Äôd like these people and the next call them annoying or didn Äôt want to be near them his level of affection and responsiveness would fluctuate every time i saw him as did his willingness to see me the only times i saw him truly happy were when alcohol weed or any other drug was involved and that was almost every time i saw him do you guys think he had bpd as well or is it some other unresolved trauma response i just wanna know if maybe i can sympathise with him instead of being angry and fester on hating him for the rest of my life,Attacking Behavior
I have no idea who to trust One day they are my friends and the other I hate them Idk if i am actually being used and mistreated or if I m exaggerating My confidence is so low I cant even tell when I m right or wrong in any given situation How do I deal with this I literally dont trust my own thoughts but at the same time it feels like I am right about some things It feels like my friends are taking advantage of me but what if they arent Also should I trust a woman I ve never met to send me money She wants to do it through PayPal to pay for a prostitute for me because she thinks it would help me to gain confidence Is it a scam Is she trying to set me up somehow She really wants to send me the money I know its really weird but I just dont know what to believe anymore,Attacking Behavior
As the title suggests Its very hard for me to take criticism without showing a large emotion or exhibiting anger It feels like no one understands I have this urge to prove I Äôm right all the time or to not be wrong and if someone questions my opinion it feels like an intentional hit at my integrity and then I attack Earlier today I was on a Reddit post and and this guy attacked me saying I shouldn Äôt talk about a certain situation because I have bpd I blew up and started calling him names and freaking out and everyone in the replies talked mad shit and criticized me Obviously I blew up and they made fun of my meltdown which pissed me off even more But honestly I was ready to delete my Reddit account over this It Äôs total bs I Äôm in dbt and I Äôm still responding irrationally to criticism It Äôs just so hard for me to let go of it If anyone else has this problem what is the best way to go about criticism without over reacting,Attacking Behavior

Personally mine was with a girl over the internet I was 12 she was 18 we were good friends but I always felt I had to prove something to her and get validation from her I was addicted to her attention and tried to be much more mature than I really was because I felt like if she remembered our age gap she wouldn Äôt be my friend anymore I remember texting her all day everyday We actually continued to be friends till I was 14 when she ghosted me Bur ya that was my first experience that I can think of What were you guys Äô,Attacking Behavior
So I have this issue where if something is really upsetting me I get really loud because I get frustrated And whoever I am upset with I won t let them exit the conversation because of my intense emotion and the inability for it to be resolved inside myself or for me to let it go I tend to physically block the person where they have to listen to what I m saying and when I get really disregulated I find this really hard to control Sometimes I end up even pushing the person backwards Please help I ve been told and have come to realise this is abusive behaviour I can t take it back and I feel like a defect of a human who can t help myself and continues to hurt others I really don t want to be this But does anyone relate Because I feel insane and just plain abusive,Attacking Behavior
Hi first time posting so sorry if this has been asked before Seeking idk inspiration from others with bpd on if a stable long term relationship is possible because I feel a bit hopeless TW for narcissistic abuse and sexual assault if you wanna stop reading now It s also just a long vent about my love life and not that important just context and needed a vent I guess I m 25f strongly strongly suspect I have quiet BPD Have suspected it since I was in high school and all attempts at diagnosis have been met with either stigma you haven t thrown a chair at me so you dont have bpd or uncertainty you have all the traits of bpd except angry outbursts so cant give a definitive answer I also have a very fearful avoidant attachment style and a strong fear of abandonment because of an absent mother I ve been in one long term relationship from 18 21 and if I m honest with myself like I was an awful person in that relationship like I cheated and was always angry at him and nothing he could do was ever enough because I was deeply depressed and seeking others to fill my emptiness After that break up I moved cities with the intention of starting over and I did a lot of work on myself and built a career and a home ect and found some stability amongst a couple bad episodes I found myself in a few too many situationships because I pursued unavailable partners and felt disinterested in the people who were genuinely keen on me This lead to 4 years of being single until earlier this year I was sexually assaulted on a first date and I heavily blamed myself and was using drugs just to sleep Less than a week later I met my ex who was a narcissist and normally love bombing is a turn off but I think I was so desperate for support after the trauma that I went along with it and before I knew it I was in a relationship He was emotionally abusive and it only took a month before I reached a boiling point and called it off Ofc I m not good at leaving people so I kept him around as a friend My first date after getting back out there and I got sexually assaulted again and I drunk called my ex that night for emotional support and I was met with him talking about how depressed he s been because of me ofc and then he starts telling me that I m nothing and he lied to me about all the good things he said ect ect and then I never spoke to him again But those two months are the most amount of trauma I ve ever been through and the ptsd is so overwhelming I tried to date someone recently and the guy was lovely and patient and spoke to me for a month over the phone before I was able to meet him in person but I felt the most intense anxiety of my life and my bpd start to kick in where he s my favourite person but then I m so mad and angry and hurt if he takes too long to reply to a message but we re still in the talking stage so I m trying to hide it all And at the end of it like I just felt my mental health crumbling and what was left of my stability gone So I had to end things with him as hard as it was And now I m here and I m just like so frustrated with my brain I feel like when I m on my own I can be so stable and put together but then I start dating someone and I see every part of myself I hate rise to the surface I m so moody I m so push and pull I m always angry and nothing is ever good enough I feel like I use people for my own benefit I feel like I take advantage of people and I manipulate people into behaving to this impossible standard And I just don t know how in the world I m ever supposed to maintain a relationship like I feel so powerless against it all Sometimes I wonder if I m just going to be one of those people that never gets married and has kids but that reality breaks my heart because I do want all of those things and I love connecting with people As it stands I m avoiding all forms of dating whilst I heal this ptsd enough to go on a date without having 6 panic attacks first but I m also not very good at being alone and its been rough,Attacking Behavior
I get overly obsessed with people so much that i push them away i Äôm sure most of you can relate I have a friend let Äôs call her Emma Emma is my favorite person in fact i favorite her so much that i sometimes really hate her I want to be friends with her forever she is the nicest person and has never done anything wrong to me ever but recently i asked her what are some negative traits that she dislikes in me She said i make her feel bad and i am very manipulative and i confuse her a lot Now i don Äôt want to sound like a terrible person because i Äôll do anything for her literally anything I don Äôt want her to have any friends other than me if she doesn Äôt text or respond to me right like saying Äúwe Äôll see Äù or Äúmaybe i Äôll call you in a bit Äù or just Äúlmao Äù like say yea or no get to the point but say it right because it stresses me out if you don Äôt and makes me feel so many emotions at once The reason why i ask people for my negative traits is so i can be more self aware by the way Emma has become friends with my friend we Äôll call her Millie Millie now and millie is one of my close friends I Äôm scared they Äôll become closer because before i did everything in my power to make them hate each other but now they Äôre friends Emma is very gullible so i asked her to show me all her text messages between millie and they aren Äôt bad but it got me pissed because i thought they would become closer but Emma reassured me that i am her best friend but j don Äôt know I can Äôt trust either of them but i love them both very much and i hate them sometimes a lot and i called Emma a crybaby and raged at her one time because she was socializing with someone who wasn Äôt me I know this is extreme jealousy and toxicity but i usually tend to get obsessed with people before i split and end things and i really want to change Any tips would be helpful,Attacking Behavior

We been together for almost 4 years It took me this long to diagnose her with BPD This whole time we just thought it was anger issues because that Äôs all she was showing in the beginning but as of lately the BPD has been hurting our relationship more than the anger outbursts I dont understand how somebody could say these heartless things to somebody they Äôre supposed to love It still doesn Äôt make sense which is why I Äôm here Fuck she even told me my dick wasn Äôt big enough anymore one time Even though she loved it and used to say it was perfect She tells me she loves me but then some days she tells me I disgust her and she Äôs tired of me Lately she Äôs been telling me to leave her a lot Saying I deserve better On top of that the Äúsplitting Äù She Äôs unaware that she has BPD Once in awhile she Äôll tell me that she wants to be free from this relationship or ask to be in a open relationship because I Äôm not longer attractive to her She is able to have 0 empathy A lot of times it Äôs like walking on egg shells but what can I do I Äôve only walked out like one time because I know that if I leave during arguments it would just come back 100x worse when I see her again It Äôs so easy for her to disrespect me Its so hard to find the perfect balance between not enabling her behavior but not pushing her away at the same time,Attacking Behavior
The title says it all But there can often be behaviors we Äôve done that makes sense once we learn of our BPD diagnosis For example for me I have a solitary tattoo that is tastefully located in the small of my back right above my buttocks I feel this is best explained by my BPD because I got it impulsively very young while self medicating through a toxic relationship with someone who had 1 3 lifetime on me How has that been true for you Tell me how you knew you had BPD before you knew you had BPD What were the tell tell signs that you were momma Äôs little fuck freak Tell me all your secrets Tell me you have BPD without having BPD,Attacking Behavior
My 25f boyfriend 22m always end up yelling at me and calls me bad stuff whenever we argue behind closed doors He interrupts me whenever I try to talk calmly and silences me by yelling at me We haven t fought in a long time and today we somehow ended up fighting just because I asked him about some of the new girls he started following on instagram and tiktok who only posted lewds as it was making me insecure He s also a previous PA but tells me he s worked on it and no longers has the same issues I simply wanted to express me being hurt over it and talk about it but instead he started yelling at me as usual and calling me names I was calm and asked him to not yell at me or interrupt me That somehow made him even more angry and he started calling me manipulative and asked me what my objective was in the argument He thought I was trying to pin him for something he d done even though I never even said anything like that I was simply just asking him why he felt the need to follow such girls when he knows it makes me insecure I just wanted to talk about it But anyhow The argument ended badly he was shiftblaming everything on me and calling me a manipulative psychopath who didn t show any emotions just because I was calm unlike him and he thought I was trying to make him look like a bad person or something He asked me if I was splitting which I wasn t and said I was trying to sabotage the relationship As for right now we re in different rooms and avoiding each other It s been 3 hours I m just confused really He tried to make it sound as if yelling and swearing is normal and okay to do when you re angry And I don t feel like that I ve yelled at him a maximum of 2 times in a 1 5 year relationship I never called him names or said anything bad to him yet he does it everytime to me Is it really normal for him to behave like that And is it really okay Also how do I make him stop I really love him but when he gets like this he never sees anything wrong with his behaviour and always blames me I feel like I never win in an argument He always silences me and ends up getting the last word,Attacking Behavior
he was my fp for almost a year and he abandoned me just like my other fp who betrayed me as well he said he s done putting up with me and got nothing in return and that I m annoying and don t allow him any freedom he said he doesn t care for me and cares for the person who caused part of my trauma and sided with the person who caused most of it over me then he said get jealous all you want and that he s tired of talking I thought I was getting better and becoming a better partner things were finally looking up I was happy for 2 days which is the longest I ve gone in months it was all ruined I feel broken he has always been manipulative gaslighted me victim blamed me guilt tripped me lied to me etc according to my friends as well and yet I feel like I m the one to blame I ve done bad things too and he held that over my head I guess I m looking for support I don t know how to move on from a fp the last one caused me to be diagnosed with PTSD after he betrayed me and this one caused me trauma as well how can I trust anyone again the people I cared for most never cared for me I m a burden and an annoyance I m tired,Attacking Behavior
I know for us the feeling of abandonment can be crushing But for me I realized that my current group of friends did not and could not appreciate me for my quirks I was always constantly apologizing to the point where I wanted to save my apologies for when they mattered Well when I called them out on specific behaviors that triggered me one person who called himself a friend of mine told me you re never going to get an apology It was then I realized that these people were never going to treat me fairly I was the mentally ill one I was the loose canon the tumor that needed to be removed And I needed to be happy again to not be a problem To not be a burden on their mental state To be away and come back normal And I don t feel bad about losing them Not in the slightest They couldn t see how I was trying Nah I like and dislike what I did next Our whole dispute revolved around person X and their handling of a situation Or rather mishandling My friend has always said that Person X did nothing wrong with breaking confidentiality with me and inflaming the situation So I baited him into a bind I basically devalued his problems to give him a taste of his own medicine He then compared how he felt to when I felt anger at the comparison person X made I then countered oh but I thought she did nothing nothing wrong You make no sense Stop talking about this he told me You keep bringing it up I calmly told him I m not the one who brought it up this time You did He apologized and I called him pathetic I said I baited him on purpose to demonstrate how it feels to be devalued This resulted in a block I don t feel bad for losing him In general I feel like my instincts are in the right place I just go about it in a hostile and insulting way That is what I need to change But no amount of telling people about this seems to make them listen You hurt their feelings exact revenge ho boy That turns heads But often times it doesnt have the results you want It doesn t make them think about how they are fucking up Sometimes you just gotta let it be and take care of yourself,Attacking Behavior

I have a friend let Äôs say Rachel that I made that I noticed was engaging in manipulative behavior towards me At first I thought it was the influence of one of her friends let Äôs say Ann who was extremely toxic towards both her and I I decided to go NC with Ann but Rachel wouldn Äôt respect my boundaries and kept trying to bring Ann into my life During this time I noticed that Rachel was trying to manipulate me into her belief system as she couldn Äôt respect my religious beliefs If we had conversations about politics she would immediately get hostile since things could only be black or white where I Äôm all about nuance and detail This led to her giving half truths to another mutual friend about my positions on certain issues in a way that made it seem like I don Äôt care about a big issue at the time I finally stopped hanging with Rachel after she tried to gaslight me regarding being NC with Ann while complaining to me about Ann using threats of suicide to keep their friendship I made a mistake and messaged Rachel while I was messaging others one night while drinking Which is my fault Now I do want to meet but only explain why I found our friendship toxic And how I think it Äôs best if we go our separate ways Do you think I should meet up Some friends suggested I ghost or act busy but I personally feel like everyone deserves the truth,Attacking Behavior

I Äôve noticed that my anger really spirals around certain people because of a habit they might have Like the person doesn Äôt even have to be talking to me but something in their manner the way they pronounce a word a saying they use rhetorical questions just sets me off and I get so triggered I mainly act inwards in these situations but sometimes I Äôve snapped at someone cause I Äôm so annoyed Ä I also make comments about the person and criticize the way they speak or whatever behind their backs cause it triggers so much anger Which is honestly so petty and I feel enormous guilt for doing it Even people who are really lovely towards me can drive me insane just because they Äôre so rhetorical or use a phrase I hate Anyone else,Attacking Behavior

You wouldn t expect somebody who deals with a lot of borderline symptoms themselves to be solely fixing the life of somebody who is even more borderine than them would you Yet this is the situation I ve ended up in I m considered the borderline whisperer by most people in my life because I m the rare combination of being a nerd that has been studying psychology especially BPD with great interest for many years and because I see the disorder from the inside being that I m on the borderline spectrum myself When I feel well I quite enjoy offering peer support and sharing knowledge I ve gained I don t know about being a whisperer but when I feel well I handle spitting very very well because nothing the borderline individual says will bother me because I know it s just because they re hurting and I can often validate and help them feel better But go back a bit and note the qualifier when I feel well When I don t feel well I m hyper sensitive I sob constantly and I m feeling just as lost as most of you when you come post here I need help too And therein lies the problem Long story short the powers that be in my life have me helping one particular borderline individual because they saw how good I am with him and how much I ve helped him already I love him dearly and when I feel well nothing he says or does bothers me I know it s just the BPD talking and it rolls off me like water off a duck s back I validate and soothe he calms down he apologizes we move on I am fine with this part The problem is I am not given any time or space for being borderline myself These people call them family they see that I am not as bad off as this person because he just started working on his mental illness and I first got therapy 15 years ago and have been working on myself since then But everybody equates that to I m totally healthy and stable I am not Some days you ll see me I look fine I manage my symptoms like a rockstar and don t let anything get to me I stay cool headed and approach everything with validation and sound logic I m mindful using radical acceptance etc But this isn t every day It s only the calm before the next storm Eventually the darkness starts creeping back in and if I don t nip it in the bud I m gonna spiral down into being hella vulnerable Then it doesn t take much mean behavior from other people to push me into an outright crisis Well this pisses like everyone I know off They think I m just not trying hard enough or something It s like they acknowledge that all people on the borderline spectrum are beautiful and deserving of help except for me With me they think I should just shut up and suck it up And on days like today when I cannot I get bullied They bullied the shit out of me this afternoon even after I said I have nothing against the person above and still love him and still want to help I didn t even ask any of them for help with what I was feeling I was trying to deal with it on my own I TRIED TO TAKE HALF A DAY OFF FOR SELF CARE AND THEY GOT MAD Apparently in their eyes I don t even deserve that They kept saying untrue things like I don t care I m selfish I m lazy how can I let this guy down etc and they just would not fucking stop Why the hell can t any of them lift a finger and do something for this guy They pushed me so far I ended up destroying a bunch of stuff on my bookcase because I couldn t take what they were doing and the fact nobody ever stands up for me What the hell Have you ever heard a group of people act accepting toward one borderline individual in the group but acting like the other can do nothing right Oh also the we ll call them the leader of the family he s borderline too but also narcissist So part borderline What the hell It s bad enough in the world at large feeling different from everybody else and like I don t measure up but even among my own kind I m judged as less They really send the message of All your feelings are valid because all feelings are valid except they re not if it s you I ve always longed to have a rock in my life A place to run when the whole world is shitting on me and everyone else turns their back I ve never experienced it but I know I suffer from not having it I never can calm down all the way because I feel so exposed and unprotected I don t feel like anybody sees me as worthy or protecting I wish somebody would stick up for me Just once I wanna know what it s like,Attacking Behavior
I am male 26 years old and I am very narcissistic egocentric to the point of having feelings of grandiosity omnipotence superiority etc My narcissism egocentrism and those feelings grandiosity omnipotence superiority etc cause me to have high self esteem high self confidence I don t need attention validation approval from others because I feel superior to everyone I lack empathy guilt remorse and only care about myself The thing is that there s more to it than just the narcissism egocentrism I am also very sadistic especially sexually and therefore I like very submissive masochistic women Depending on my energy levels I feel either less or more aggressive the more energy I have the more aggressive I feel The thing is that when I feel with energy I feel very aggressive and those feelings of grandiosity omnipotence superiority etc are enhanced to the max There s also something that happens to me where I feel a sudden strong impulse urge For instance if something makes me angry I instantly switch to feeling very aggressive and feel a sudden strong impulse urge to kill Or if for instance I am at a nightclub and a song with an aggressive beat to it starts playing I instantly switch to feeling very aggressive and feel a sudden strong impulse urge to approach women and I instantly start making out with them just by using strong body language strong eye contact I have been blessed with good looks so that also helps when it comes to attracting the opposite sex I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 5 years old so I am not sure if that s what could be causing some of what I mentioned Its worth mentioning that I am very logical and I don t do anything that could land me in jail because obviously I don t want to go to jail Although in the past I have done crazy things when feeling aggressive that could have easily landed me in jail I have normal parents and was never abused bullied by anyone I had a normal childhood,Attacking Behavior

I got serious with this guy around this time last year Back then he was a stable confident calm person who always spoiled me and was very eager to love and understand me Somewhere along the way it Äôs just gone to shit We argue all the time over big things and small things arguments turn extremely toxic originally initiated by me but now he plays along and I believe he Äôs lost every bit of respect for me In this moment I don Äôt believe I love him anymore and I Äôm honestly just tempted to do really nasty sneaky shit behind his back because that has always been my response to failed romantic relationships Anyone with BPD know if this is still worth trying for Im avoiding a break up of course and he says he Äôs willing to change as am I but our behaviors and interactions don Äôt flow how they used to it feels very methodical in order to avoid arguing which we still don Äôt accomplish Idk I think I brought out the absolute worst in him Ä we keep talking about our future together even though we both realize we haven Äôt had the same fulfilling connection we started with for the past 6 months,Attacking Behavior
Hey guys I don t feel myself anymore whenever someone is close That s extremely frustrating because I m not myself around others I help them with their needs and I give them what they want That process is automated I don t think about it I do notice it happening but I can t really stop myself There is no alternative Either I isolate myself or I fixate on other people The only time I don t have that issue is when I communicate online with people that I don t know through text So in the past I ve honestly been a horrible mean soulless troll and hater on the internet It felt so free to finally unleah all my built up frustration I m sick and tired of being there for people I m sick and tired of making people happy I m sick and tired of being their therapist And it doesn t even work Because it makes me HATE socialising It feels like work And at some point I just flip and hate everyone And then I isolate myself completely I also automatically look for friends who are either super judgmental or who are extremely mentally unstable And they are desperate for someone who stays So they also stay It s so toxic I want this to stop I want to feel free and I want to be able to be an asshole Not even an asshole just not a personal therapist,Attacking Behavior

To me someone that wants to keep living with their parent I find it odd I forget people have loving parents I grew up with someone who raised me well as much as she could despite the death of my dad Gave me a roof and everything I needed You Äôd think if I had such amazing mother how could I ever hate her Someone who always tried to keep me going forward But truth is I don Äôt love her nor do I hate her All the emotions change accordingly to circumstances We argue and yell then I want to leave and never speak to her We Äôre having a great time and I wonder why did I wanna leave When I was little I would see her with others kids being calm and gentle while she Äôd be harsh with me And I Äôd give her an attitude and she Äôd wonder why I always asked why she treated me differently and she would tell me it Äôs cuz I Äôm her kid When I was 11 some stuff were going on in our lives and I was falling apart and so was she Some day in that age she tried to suffocate me with a pillow because I didn Äôt tell the police the entire incident because I was ashamed Instead of hugging and reassurance I got an angry mother who yelled at me We fought and screamed and I still haven Äôt told her the entire truth She always reacted to things I did in an intense way where I got internet taken away or my phone for a month I handled my own emotions alone and tried to solving things on my own Because asking her for help always sent me in a panic attack or full mental breakdown Because I knew id be punished by isolation silent treatment or get things thrown at me I always took my own decisions Yet on my birthdays she Äôd make me a cake and buy me presents that I always loved Would sometimes drunk call me from a party that she loved me and was sorry about everything But this relationship is taking a toll on me I can Äôt keep going back and forth Someone who told me I can tell her everything no matter what Yet when I did she would say ÄúWhy didn Äôt you tell me I Äôm always telling you You can tell me anything I Äôll always believe you But do you know how this makes me feel If you don Äôt tell me things how am I supposed to know Äù To which I cried because I was 9 when I took a decision to not tell her the truth about how my stepfather at that time was abused me once I kept saying I was a kid when I did all those decisions stop blaming me And she apologised If u read this far thank u just ranting,Attacking Behavior
Someone said something insulting to me last night and I ended up saying something even more insulting back and then once that rage switch was flipped then that was that Sent out vile messages said awful things to other people about said person that actually just made me look bad because they were such low blows I left destruction in my wake because one person I had met that night said something rude I can Äôt even really remember what it was Now I just feel ashamed and like I burnt bridges with other people because of how I reacted Told a guy that I like why I thought the person I argued with was just a complete idiot and sounded so holier than thou in retrospect Well the universe did get me back today because I woke up and immediately something fell in my eye and I had to go to the optometrist hungover as hell turns out I have a corneal scratch now lol I haven Äôt eaten today and I don Äôt want to because I don Äôt feel like I deserve food after ruining my relationship with two people who weren Äôt even involved Is it weird that I don Äôt really care about how the person that I said all that mean shit to feels If she was in front of me I would probably do it again it wasn Äôt exactly undeserved I only really care because people I like bore witness I wish I didn Äôt blow up at everything all the time FML,Attacking Behavior
I was friends with someone for 5 years best friends really Near the end of those 5 years she confessed to me that she had romantic feelings for me We were romantically involved extremely briefly after that around a month It was my first romantic experience and I was really overwhelmed and confused I didn t feel fully comfortable with everything that we were doing specifically the physical stuff I was scared of and didn t really know how to say no so I gave in because she kept saying things that indicated she really wanted it Stuff like I just always want sex it s so hard for me to control myself etc I told her I didn t want sex but the next day she initiated sexual stuff I was scared to reject her We had talked about sexual stuff in the past but I just wanted to take things slow It was my first experience at my old age of 25 and I felt embarrassed that I didn t know what I was doing We weren t in a relationship or anything really she just told me she wanted time to work on her OCD before committing to me But stuff was still going on between us and she was still pursuing me Near the end of that involvement she told me she still had feelings for her ex She had called him asking him if he still loved her They had gotten back in contact and I saw that she was always texting him even when physical stuff was happening between us immediately before and after she would be texting him I didn t want to act like some crazy jealous person so I didn t comment on it She also told me someone else was pursuing her for a relationship and another person for an FWB thing She had spent the night before flirting with these two people and being all over them sitting in their lap and stuff right in front of me Again I didn t comment I didn t want to act like some crazy jealous person I also didn t know yet what all was going on between her and all these people She didn t tell me any of this until after a lot of physical stuff happened between us that I didn Äôt feel fully ready for She didn t really put an official end to things She just told me she wanted to go see her ex and that she had feelings for both of us I didn t find out till later that she actually just wanted to get back with him This was the day after she told me she wanted to be with me and chose me I felt so sick when I found out I literally threw up the first time I heard her voice again after she told me her and her bf were back together The whole experience left me very hurt I felt very used cheap ashamed and discarded This was about 9 months ago and I haven t told anyone out loud about this experience except for once to my therapist In the months following that I tried really hard to be compassionate I tried to tell myself well she had BPD it makes romance hard I know because I have it also But the more time went on the more she kept telling me what happened between us didn t mean anything to her She told me she just pursued me because she was jealous that someone else would be my first experience and not her She told me she regretted that we were ever friends and that she only cares about her boyfriend She told me that I was the biggest mistake she ever made It was sad for me because our friendship meant a lot Some other fights happened and she ended our friendship I approached her a while later and asked her why she thought it was okay to take advantage of me for my lack of experience and she told me I just made that up on purpose to target her OCD Even though she told me herself on at least 5 occasions that she only pursued me out of jealousy that someone else would be my first kiss etc and not her Meaning if id had experience before none of this would ve happened My point with this long ramble is how much am I allowed to be angry at her and hurt over this It s been 9 months and I cant move on I feel so gross and dirty over this Like an object there to screw around with and throw out is what it all made me feel I have such a hard time focusing on what I need to which is school and my job right now It feels so silly to be hung up on something that lasted for such a short while I try to have compassion for her mental illness but it s so hard I don t know if her having BPD excuses doing this to me She was my best friend and her lack of honesty and her manipulation and the fact she led me on really was a huge blow to my already non existent self confidence She knew I was very insecure about my lack of experience she would even tease me in the past and say I m an incel She also knew I had a lot of religious anxiety and that going into my first gay romantic experience was hard mentally I just don t know how to move on I don t know what is okay to dismiss when someone has BPD I have BPD also which makes the emotions even more confusing I m lost and hurt and I dont know if I m allowed to be given she is mentally ill I don t know if her mental illness is even what caused this to happen or not but she did use it as an excuse I don t know if that is okay or if I am supposed to just forgive her and act like it was okay to be treated like this by my own former best friend,Attacking Behavior
for reference I m almost 21 and i ve been diagnosed with BPD for just over a year and doing DBT for that long too I ve also been diagnosed with bipolar II and have been medicated for five months which also feels relevant to mention I m also in a relationship my first serious relationship with a man who I ve been seeing for about 5 months as well Sorry this post is a mess I m struggling to think straight right now Everything just feels like it s fallen apart lately and I ve been in a major depressive episode since around February 8th I ve been struggling to leave the house at all and am crying at least once a day This recently worsened as I haven t been able to afford to see my therapist in this time and all of my friends have been busy I ve just wanted a distraction So much seems to just be going wrong I haven t had shifts at my job in forever I m starting uni again soon and almost dropped out last semester and I haven t been home in a year my parents live interstate and we recently formed a really healthy relationship All my closest friends have moved away too or they ve drifted from me and are leaving my messages on read I feel so alone Two other major triggers happened during this period on the same day First my best friend messaged me and said she didn t want to be friends with me anymore as I had been cancelling plans with her Then as he was talking to me about what happened my boyfriend called me his ex s name This is the second time this has happened and I felt like I was going to puke I tried to stay calm and be normal about it but I instantly went mute I struggle a lot with going mute in stressful and upsetting situations and started internally having a panic attack This was the day before Valentine s day We both ended up crying and trying to talk about it and eventually calmed down and went to bed We ve spoken about it again but it s so hard for me to feel comfortable around him again and I ve noticed I m splitting with him more and more frequently He s also said things recently that have upset me too I broke down yesterday about feeling alone and when I apologised to him because the past three weeks have been me crying he said it s okay and that he likes comforting me I can t exactly place my finger on what made me upset about this but it made me feel so ill He also jokingly calls me a hoe a bitch and a wench and everytime after goes I m so sorry I shouldn t be calling you mean names but does it again and again It s his apology and him not stopping that just makes me so upset I struggle majorly with standing up for myself and after he called me his ex s name I started apologising to him and trying to comfort him as he was visibly upset and afraid I would leave him I also just felt numb and wanted everything to end He called me out on this and said I shouldn t be villifying myself but I struggle so much to know if I m rightfully being upset or not I also don t know if he was actually sorry or sorry he got called out I don t know if he actually loves me or just doesn t want to be alone I m so overwhelmed and just don t know what to do and I don t know if this relationship is good for me I have lots of relationship and sexual trauma and he s the only person I had never dissociated with during sex but recently I have been I feel like my entire trust of him is gone and I don t want to hurt him by breaking up with him he was so distraught when he thought I was going to but I m in so much pain We see each other every night for dinner but today I cancelled and I made up an excuse for tomorrow I just feel so lost I spent today crying about everything and could barely stomach anything I feel so hopeless,Attacking Behavior

hello i don t really know where else to put this but i really need to get it off my chest around this time last year i went out to a club drinking with some good friends of mine for context i am a cis woman and my friends were about 2 other girls and 5 straight dudes but we have all been friends for a couple years and i have always trusted them when we drink together this particular night i took my prescribed adderall before drinking usually i will refrain from taking my meds if i know i am drinking but it was a spontaneous outing so i couldn t detox in time in retrospect this was a horrible idea do NOT mix stimulants and alcohol because i blacked out after 1 tequila sour anyways the last thing i remember was dancing at the club with my girls and the next time i m conscious i am in one of my guy friends bed and he s taking my clothes off i literally had zero clue as to how i left the club and got back to his place i don t remember kissing him dancing with him or anything at all but somehow i m in his bed half naked i also know i didn t plan on fucking anyone that night because i was on my period when i regained consciousness i was in so much shock i got up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and convinced myself it was a dream here is where i am confusing myself instead of leaving his room and the bathroom i pulled out my tampon and went back to his bed even though i had zero desire to have sex at all the thoughts going through my head were well you did something while blacked out to end up here so you gotta stay and finish this shit but as soon as i got back into his bed i completely blacked again when i woke back up he was inside me again i blacked out i had so many memory holes from this night but i vividly remember getting BACK INTO HIS bed even after the first time i woke up in it and realizing this is not at all what i wanted i also have no memory of how i got back home with my girlfriends but the next day i was home with them and so i asked them about what tf happened last night what made things even MORE confusing for me was that one of the girls said she saw us dancing at the club but that it looked super platonic more than anything and that HE was way more into it than i was if i was obviously not into him like that how tf did i end up back in his bed the weeks after this happened i completely spiraled into a horrible depression and cycle of self destruction i isolated myself from the whole friend group because i felt like i couldn t trust anyone anymore but more than anything i felt that i had betrayed myself i went back into his bed which probably to him was more than a sign of consent and let him fuck me while i was blacked out of my mind and even worse as i isolated myself i still so badly wanted to make sure that him and the rest of my friends still liked me and accepted me even though i know that some weird shit went down that night i wanted so badly to be apart of a friend group and didn t let my emotions get in the way of that after 2 weeks of isolating now my brain was telling me i HAD to spend time with them and specifically with the guy who took me home i went out of my way to hang out with him even though every single time i saw him all i could think about was how fucking drunk and out of it i was when i woke up in his bed now it s been an entire year and while i am still friends with them the guilt and shame i am feeling from that night is absolutely deafening i can t go one hour without thinking about it and everyday i break down crying because all i can see him as is my abuser BUT because i acted like everything was fine and EVEN got back in his bed he thinks we re the bestest friends i feel like complete and utter shit i don t know if it was my BPD that made me think i needed to get his validation after he did that to me but i know that i m living a fucking lie and i don t know if it even counts as sexual assault or not i guess i m just looking for someone to read listen because i feel like i can t talk to anyone in real life about this since i ve been acting super cool with him them since it happened anything helps,Attacking Behavior
Does anyone else have trouble saying no to other people Not in any particular situation but I always find myself agreeing and doing whatever someone may ask of me simply because I have such a desire to be liked by everyone I thought this was something I would get better with as I got older but I m 20 now and struggle with it more than ever It s at the point where it s making me a doormat This past weekend for example I went on a date with a guy I had just met and we went back to his place to watch a movie I was okay with kissing him but I did nervously tell him that was all I wanted to do since I am a virgin He began trying to persuade me into more and I went along with it simply because I m so scared of saying no and potentially being rejected not liked I ve never been more angry with myself for losing myself and my values in a situation that could ve been prevented if I had been stronger How do I strengthen myself as an individual and stick up more for what I want I m tired of losing who I am in the hopes that I ll be accepted by everyone,Attacking Behavior
So my boyfriend is a gentle patient loving person and I Äôm surprised again and again that he still wants to be with me despite my mood swings I love him I really do Yesterday I had a complete episode breakdown in response to the Roe V Wade decision and did a one woman protest I basically acted like a fucking lunatic in public and may have been banned from a few places No one got hurt and no property was damaged And yes I Äôve been taking my meds I don Äôt regret doing it because I don Äôt give a flying fuck anymore I hate where I live and I hate most of the people in it I expressed all of my hate rage and disgust towards these animals in a provocative way Fuck them But I scared him He was worried about my safety and said my behavior wasn Äôt rational However He agrees with me 100 and wants to protest as well I feel bad that my behavior scared him and he Äôs probably accepted the fact that there is a side of me that is crazy And not cute crazy Like Äúthis bitch is mentally ill Äù crazy I Äôm worried about losing him but at the same time I can Äôt blame myself for losing my shit about this Whatever,Attacking Behavior
I am feeling a lot of confusion and fear at the moment I 27F have been struggling with addiction as most of us with BPD do with alcohol In the 4 years that my boyfriend 34M have been together I Äôve had numerous relapses and episodes that have caused him distress and trauma I have fully accepted responsibility apologized sincerely and often gone to therapy together supported him when he needed to talk and suggested Al anon to him I completely understand that he has every right to feel angry sad mistrustful all of it But lately things have gotten dark There are times when something he does hurt my feelings To be clear these events actions are not related to my drinking Just everyday hurtful word choices or actions When I calmly tell him that what he did hurt my feelings he instantly goes into being angry and telling me that he Äôs been through worse Recently I made an extremely thoughtful mixtape of all of our favorite songs with a letter as a gift for our 4 year dating anniversary He later handed me an Amazon package of bra fashion tape that he already told me he was ordering for me for a dress I was wearing to party that already passed He said ÄúHappy Anniversary Äù not in a passive aggressive way just genuinely with a smile I sat down and said ÄúHey ___ I thought this was something you were already getting as a favor for x event that already happened I feel like this is a bit of an afterthought and I feel kind of hurt Äù He flew off the handle and went into how he would be grateful for anything I got him that I was always starting shit even after all I put him through I started crying and said that it Äôs just hurtful to feel like you didn Äôt put effort or energy into it it Äôs not about money he Äôs done this before with gifts like a grocery store gift card for Christmas that he most likely already had He then went to Walmart came back and angrily tossed some bags gifts Ä at me while I was still lying on the couch This was extremely triggering for me as my father growing up was very passive aggressive and humiliated us by calling us spoiled when we asked for something and when we apologized he went on to say something along the lines of Äú no You Äôre getting the damned chocolate bar and you Äôre going to eat it Äù I ran upstairs and started having a panic attack He followed me and said he didn Äôt want to fight anymore I told him what he did was not okay and again he launched into ÄúYou have hurt me countless times with your drinking Äù I told him if he wanted to have a conversation about that we could I asked how I could support him and he said that I could think about what I Äôve done to him before getting upset about things like the present This is just the most recent and severe example What essentially feels like is happening is that he thinks because I have hurt him with my addiction I have that I should no longer be allowed to bring up anything he does that upsets me Anytime I bring up anything I am upset about he immediately dismisses me by talking about the things in the past that he Äôs upset about and my issue is never resolved When this whole huge fight happened I brought up that he didn Äôt apologize for his behavior He yelled Äúwhat about me You never apologized for x event or y event when you were drinking Äù I had Every time and multiple times I ended up screaming Äú I Äôm sorry I Äôm so sorry I hate myself I fucking HATE myself Äù And then he said ÄúThank you Äù I anticipate the response to this lengthy post will be to leave him Or maybe even you deserve it Ä he needs time But I love him I hate myself And I am broken,Attacking Behavior

When i split it usually tends to not last very long and so i can do a lot of damage in a short time period and feel instant regret after Ive come up with a solution for when im feeling like this and im not face to face with the person but im over message Basically stop messaging them take a deep breath pretend your notes app is a text message Get it all out Everything Sob for a good twnety minutes Put your phone down for an hours and watch love actually or your go to comfort show and then feel much better and a lot less regretful I know its simple and people probably already do this but im dumb and this took me forever to work out So for my fellow dumb people i hope this helps It stopped me from permanently destroying my relationships with my FP today so if this helps just one person ill be happy,Attacking Behavior

I m scared of myself I have tried so hard to just repress my anger And it s gotten so bad the last couple of years especially in the morning time I don t know why I m so mean I hate myself for it I ponder of all of the ways I wrong people My girlfriend loves me and I very very rarely have tantrums around her I ve never insulted her or said anything with the intent to hurt her intentionally atleast but I do at times say things in a snappy tone without really realizing I do it But once I hear how I hurt her in her voice I try my hardest to reprimand my wrongs by showering her with complements which works sometimes but my main concern with my anger is at home with my family Jesus I m a fucking time bomb If anyone asks to do anything that would empend or disrupt what I m doing I fucking freak Not like throwing things at people or breaking stuff but I yell and as a adolescent male with a full build it can be intimidating When I say yell I don t mean raise my voice I fucking scream full diaphragm It s gotten really bad the past few days because life is just stressful I m not going to go into a rant but LSS Breaker went out about four days ago so my room has no electric I m poor so I I have any real material possessions that cost more than like 20 besides my bed and phone It s winter and I live in a trailer The only outlet I can use to charge my phone is on the dryer and every where else has so many people I have like 0 privacy So when I m on the phone I have to sit on the dryer it s rlly cold in my room like 10 15 degrees and I don t have anywhere else to sleep so I usually sleep on the dryer and during the morning I ll head into my room to lay This morning I was so tired I went into my room and slept through the cold until like 2pm But not only that the same breaker also connects to a few diff parts of the house so the lights in the living room and kitchen don t work and a few of the outlets in there don t as well We couldn t afford car payments so they took our only means of transportation My grades are at an all time low with all F s I m a junior and usually average out at a 3 5 Gpa I have a 1 I believe I don t go to school and when people try to make me I lash out The last time it happened my mother insulted me for 15 minutes straight and then came back later to ask me what s wrong what happened You can talk to me in which I broke down crying and for the first time in a very very long time she tried to show me affirmation and I just couldn t handle it and out of impulse said back off I immediately started apologizing and asked for a moment alone For a little context 70 of my trauma comes from her and the things people she put me around so in a way I feel justified to be angry But she s old now near 48 and If I could legally I d move out She always tells me how much she wishes I wasn t around but all the times I tried to leave I had a ride to TN to live with a friend she started sobbing begging me to stay I just want to be calm but I constantly feel like I m being insulted which usually I am haha but the times I m not and I realize I feel like an absolute ass for getting upset Or I m so stressed that Im not even here disassociation and usually when I disassociate I m very distant but quite tranquil from a second hand perspective I just want to be normal Tl dr Explosive 16 year old in poverty family hates me and I m in a pretty tough life position Vent,Attacking Behavior
context I 18F always get extremely jealous whenever I see my boyfriend s 19M ex post pictures on instagram or whenever I m out and about and I run into the various women he s had flings hookups with I always compare myself to every single pretty girl I see out there which is a problem because literally every woman is so so so gorgeous bisexual woman here btw lol I would find myself constantly checking his ex s instagram to see what she posted and to see if I was prettier than her or not At first it was just kind of sad because I d feel bad about myself and tell myself how ugly and undesirable I am I m not But then it turned into full on bitching about other women in my private time I d screenshot his ex s posts on her story and I d save it to my camera roll and put it in my eyes only on snapchat and I would make fun of her in awful mean ways I knew it was wrong but it was the only thing that made me feel even a little bit better about myself amp x200B But recently I ve started going to therapy twice a week and my therapist has helped me learn some techniques to battle the delusioned thoughts about others that I m having Long story short I ve deleted all of the screenshots and I blocked the accounts of the people that I constantly check up on for no reason and I m choosing to focus on myself and love rather than focusing on others and hate Distancing myself from the things I know will bring negativity in my life has helped me get back into that mindset of realizing how hot and wonderful I am and how nice it is to be nice both to myself and to other people I hope I can get a little more secure in my body and mind so that I can hopefully reach out to these women and maybe maintain a friendship They re not bad people quite the opposite actually Anyways I know it may not seem like a big deal but I made stalking his past lovers a RELIGION it was like an addiction where every time I would end up hurting myself but I just couldn t stop But now it s time for me to focus on myself heheh lt 3,Attacking Behavior
i Äôm sorry it Äôs gonna be so long context i live with two roommates with whom i became friends we Äôre pretty close we make sure we Äôre honest with each other to maintain a healthy living environment and have some rules like since we have different sleeping schedules we stay as quiet as possible when someone Äôs had a rough night and is sleeping through the day things have been weird lately they started going out without me canceling plans and just being very distant for some reason event it happened one morning i have bipolar and bpd and i Äôm in a depressive episode i Äôm woken up in the morning with noises so loud i instantly have a panic attack i send a text in the groupchat telling them i Äôm trying to sleep fell asleep at 7am and i Äôm told to Äúget up to clean with us a mouse was in the house a few days ago Äù i Äôm confused because i wasn Äôt aware of that when i reply saying i slept at 7am i Äôm told to Äúshut up and let us clean then Äù so i Äôm like Ä okay and i text back Äúalright Äù and then i hear her yell Äústop texting me and let me clean Äù in the groupchat we tell each other the smallest of things i Äôm pretty pissed the house may be infested with rats and i wasn Äôt told they were taking precautions such as not letting their doors open and i was just oblivious plus i Äôm in a bad mood already so i go up to tell them they should Äôve at least let me know and told me they were cleaning so i Äôd wake up to help my roommate insists it Äôs something silly and that she Äôs not gonna bother tell me about that i say all it takes is a simple text but she keeps on insisting they just didn Äôt see the point of letting me know although they did call the landlord to ask him if there Äôs anything he can do so it Äôs not that silly after all one roommate admits it wasn Äôt wise from them and apologizes for leaving me out of this but the other one tells me to Äúfuck off or i Äôm gonna say or do something to you Äù among other things she Äôs not talking to me now and doing things like tossing my stuff away am i wrong i just need to know as i feel guilty,Attacking Behavior
My 21F partner 22M is a really good boyfriend and I love him so much Whenever we get into an argument even small my immediate reaction is to pack up all my shit and leave Every other relationship I ve been in I have never really been scared of them breaking up with me because idgaf I am deathly terrified of him breaking up with me and I will destroy our relationship and his feelings before I let him hurt me He has mentioned that he doesn t like it when I just pack my stuff up which is completely fair because I m definitely just acting in the heat of the moment and blowing things out of proportion I was just wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar and if there s any diffusion techniques that you guys have used that seemed effective and that I could try He knows my struggles and supports me and I m super grateful but I know what I m doing is not fair acceptable to him whatsoever,Attacking Behavior
I found out I was pregnant yesterday and had miscarriage all in the same day I called in sick to work and I spent most of my day sleeping I then smoked a bowl yesterday even thought I was supposed to stop smoking weed and got really drunk and reached out to an ex I m married and I knew it was wrong but I still wanted validation I didn t flirt or do anything but I know he still has feelings for me so I used him to make myself feel better I also tried stalking my ex FP and saw he unblocked me but I resisted the urge to contact him I know I m grieving and upset and I shouldn t be using other people for validation I just hate the reflex to reach out and want more attention My husband has been amazing this whole time so I just feel even worse even though all I did was sat hi and ask how work was üôÉ,Attacking Behavior
I ve been re reading my old journals and I definitely have BPD I will start I once cut off an acquaintance in college because I was passing papers around and she snapped and told me to hurry up I was so embarrassed and outraged by this I cussed her out Tweeted about her then blocked her and never spoke to her again I thought it was completely fine because obviously she wasn t a friend if she tells me to hurry up in front of others It wasn t until recently that I realized yeah that s not a normal thing,Attacking Behavior
I m 14F I was 13 when she said that stuff She said that no man will ever want me if I m discussing my mental health with them and coming across as clingy I wasn t clingy I just talked to my friends a couple times a week sometimes about my mental health She made me feel like it was wrong to discuss my problems To be honest she actually made my BPD worse She was really sexist and said that I shouldn t use tampons because no man would ever want me if my vagina was loose,Attacking Behavior
We both have BPD EUPD hers being better controlled and tbh you wouldn t guess she has it Mine characterised by impulsive anger and I am not always a nice person to her I shout at her a lot way more than I noticed My BPD is not under control and it s affected her badly She still loves me she doesn t want a divorce but It has made her deeply unhappy and she is walking on eggshells not knowing due to my temperamental nature what to expect daily It peaked when I ended up shouting at my family after being perpetually frustrated I took a few days away from them where I had to face up to the fact the consequences of my actions At first I tried to rationalise what I had done and find justification for me being angry totally the wrong thing to do But then the realisation that I hurt my wife and family kicked in and the deep shame of it all was hard to swallow My parents know about my condition BPD EUPD Depression High functioning autism cluster headaches renal colic regular dental and lower back pain They are great for sympathy but not great for addressing my issues so talking to them doesn t help My problem is the anger I experience how it affects others and myself and not so much the conditions Like I said my poor wife has had the brunt of it at the times when I am upset or angry I shout when I should stop think rest and calmly talk things through It doesn t seem like an extreme emotion to me at the time But It does to everyone else because of my build and the look on my face I come across as scary Which is again something I ve never even considered until I forced myself into a position where I could I love my wife beyond expression and my little family I have always put them first before myself I am a kind considerate and loving person i can be extremely affectionate and adoring With the majority of times finding calm approaches to some stressful situations But the problem is I blow up shout and it completely overshadows everything For my kids my priority is to protect them for them not to have the hardships abuse poverty that my childhood was plagued by But somehow along the way I have become a person in the house that shouts gets frustrated and angry I have had a tough time keeping on top of my medication which when I take regularly does keeep me placid I am on Quetiapine Seroquel Duloxetine Propranolol and I supplement with passiflora drops 20 x 2 daily The latter being something new I introduced I am desperate not to lose my wife my family and I just want this to stop I do not want to upset my wife anymore I have started reading into dialectical behavioural therapy I speak to the samartians I have joined forums and groups such as these I do know I am in the wrong and I do acknowledge and accept how I have been I am ashamed but I want my focus on being to eradicate BPD EUPD out of my life and for us to be happy again,Attacking Behavior
Lately things have gotten so bad that I ve been inconveniencing people with emotional rants out of spite Fuck you you don t get to be happy You could have prevented it but you didn t You just left me here and things got worse exactly like I knew they would Who cares about normal conversation anymore All there is is pain I hate everything and everyone,Attacking Behavior
I held it in for YEARS i said some vile vicious things I really went for the heart I told him I forgave him years ago I actually didn Äôt lol and I masked it for too long and I let out years of anger and pain at him He Äôs the FP that set off my bpd I did a whitepages search on him previously and used that against him He genuinely abused me He knows he did he knows he Äôs fucked at least I Äôm brave enough to tell it to his face He should thank me I told him how everyone views him I Äôve been in therapy for the past 3 years and im extremely self aware I knew him since I was 12 he pushed me too far I don Äôt care When I lost all empathy for him I knew i didn Äôt care how bad it was How cruel I sounded Last time I would Äôve been mad and begged him to unblock me but it did the opposite He is dead to me,Attacking Behavior
Not all antisocials are like this btw There are understanding ones out there Just thought I d put this out to let people know not to stigmatize other mental disorders I know why a certain amount of them treat us as inferior though They see us as weak because of our troubles regulating emotions and tendencies to make ourselves very vulnerable with people I guess I made this as a vent source for people and to see if anyone else can relate I once made a certain post in a sociopathy group and admitted to having BPD Yeah uh some people were trying to purposefully trigger me out of boredom If anyone does this to you do not react emotionally at all and don t make yourself vulnerable,Attacking Behavior
and i Äôve been manipulating him into loving me since even tho he was suspicious of me questioning his love constantly i actually was secretly going behind his back cheating on this guy i actually made him meet i would have conversations with other people behind his back and not tell him anything pretend everything is fine it Äôs crazy i Äôm crazy hope everything is fine guys silly me oops he knew the whole time i had bpd and i tried to keep it low but i Äôve been really evil the whole time,Attacking Behavior
Oh boy it took time but I splitted so hard This person made me feel so unheard discarded and invalidated This is my FP and I use to be really close to her one day her just became distant and blocked me after some time It felt so out of nowhere and I blamed myself and self loathed but now I fucking hate her It Äôs like I Äôm feeling all the hurt again all at once I Äôm holding myself from texting where I Äôm not blocked and let her know how much she hurt me and how I despise her make she feel as hurt as I Äôm I Äôll have a final with her next Wednesday and honestly I Äôm thinking of just not going and flunking the class This semester is all fucked anyway I Äôm holding to send one last nasty text after Wednesday when I will never have to see her face again so I can get it out she blocks me and it Äôs over I want to send it now but I Äôm worry she will be scared of having to be at the same place as me I was always there for her and when she didn Äôt needed anymore she just dropped me And the fact that she shows no remorse enrages me I Äôm also holding myself from abusing anti anxiety pills and alcohol Wish she feels like she deserves every time she was abused and made felt like shit Wishing everything she holds dear is poisoned Wishing she feels the same hatred as I Äôm feeling,Attacking Behavior
I have been dating my gf for the last year and a half and am completely in love with her we formed a very strong connection off the bat and we both say we want to get married in a couple years and that we are soulmates For years before dating I was completely numb to the world had repressed all my feelings as a coping mechanism to childhood problems and she was the first person to make me feel anything again I didn Äôt even know I had bpd until a couple months ago since I had repressed all my feelings and kept everyone in my life at arms distance it was only once I began to allow myself to feel again and form an deep interpersonal connection she became my fp that all the bpd symptoms started expressing themselves and I got diagnosed Since then our relationship has been very cyclical it goes from amazing to very bad back to amazing and so on essentially amazing until I split then I make things bad She is very reassuring loving kind and patient with me more than anyone has ever been for me and I am so grateful for her I know most people would have left me by now and really cherish the fact that she hasn Äôt Recently I Äôve been splitting more and each time has been more intense I have told her that if it ever becomes that I am not good for her or her mental health and do more harm than good to not hesitate to leave me because I would rather have her happy without me than miserable with me We have been on the verge of breaking up twice in the last month and a half both times when I split really bad and it terrifies me Whenever I split and recenly even when I am in my clear headspace I go these feelings that I am not good for her She has an emotionally abusive ex who manipulated gaslight and hurt her just for the fun of it It kills me to think that I am becoming him although a much milder version but when I split I say stuff to intentionally hurt her feelings and play the victim manipulating her into feeling bad for me Last time we almost broke up I asked her if she thought I was able to be in a healthy relationship and she said Äúas of now no Äù I vowed to her to do DBT every day which I do and I see a therapist once a week and I know progress isn Äôt fast linear but it doesn Äôt seem like it Äôs helping at all yet I have all these things that I know I should do which make sense to me when in a clear headspace but as soon as I split it all goes out the window It Äôs like I don Äôt have any control of who I am when I split I get caught in these loops where I split and mess up and can see my mistakes while I am making them almost like a third party perspective but can Äôt do anything to stop it That just makes me feel worse about myself which drives me into a deport emotional hole and the cycle continues Now I am just terrified I will not be able to be good enough change fast enough to keep the relationship I feel like I have a finite amount of splits left before she leaves maybe one or 2 and don Äôt think I will be able to heal enough in time I know I told her to leave me of things got unhealthy and I meant that and stand by it but still the thought of her leaving destroys me I am completely codependent on her and am working to stop that but aren Äôt making much progress At this point I can Äôt imagine life without her and if it ever happens like I convince my self it will I don Äôt think I will ever be able to fully recover This feat eats away at me every day and makes it much easier for me to split as it really fucks with my head and keeps me in a constant state of anxiety and depression It Äôs an awful thing because the fear of her leaving me makes me act in a way that will make it more likely she will leave which adds to the fear and I can Äôt get out of this feedback loop spiral Do you have any advice on how to cope with these feelings or get out of the downward spiraling loop before it Äôs too late Tldr been on the verge of breaking up twice recently fear of losing her makes me think act in a way that is more likely to cause her to leave which makes me more scared she will leave which makes me think act in a way Ä etc etc,Attacking Behavior
i went to the amusement park last night and right before i left my dad had triggered me which is a whole different story my emotions were so unstable bc it was also my graduation day but i was a wreck the entire time first i was just having an emotional episode but i was uncontrollably sobbing and the group of people i went with just left me there which made me even more upset then when i finally pulled myself together i found them and i kept getting ignored when i asked if we could go on a ride and eventually i went on it with 2 people and i got so angry that i started talking shit about everyone else and calling them stupid and that they cant read the room etc the one person i love so much told me to shut up and that she was getting mad at me now i get angry when people dont treat me how i would treat them that was the 2nd time she s seen me have a rage episode and after a few minuets i felt horrible and embarrassed and i kept apologizing but i didnt get reassurance and nothing else felt the same the rest of the night and i feel horrible and i didnt mean anything i said but i just felt so rejected yesterday and i hate how much of a mess i am i wish i couldve just shut my mouth and i dont want to bring it up to her again but i need the reassurance bc i feel like everyone hates me now,Attacking Behavior

I never understood why I had relationship issues until I started learning more about BPD I d like to share my experience with my dating life in hopes to bring awareness and a discussion A brief backstory I have abandonment issues and it hurts like hell so I get out at the smallest signs of trouble I literally waited for my highschool sweetheart for like 7 years or more to get back with me even though I was ignored also got kicked out the house alot seriously like a lot growing up and disowned at 18 and even more failed relationships after I was that kid who lived in constant fear mental and physical abuse in whatever household I was in between my parents With that being said I dated a lot of beautiful humble women who would give the world to me I think However it all ended with me suddenly disappearing out of thin air never to see them again and giving them no closure It wasn t hard for me to jump into another relationship because I was so keen in observing people s behavior and can figure out what they wanted to hear and what intrigued them This is because after years of living in constant fear I went through a period of observing people s every behavior action and choice of words to look for familiar behaviors that were dangerous Which led to me wanting to control my immediate social environment I would not hesitate to be disagreeable if I saw someone out of line To the point where someone who was dangerous would become my friend because I understood them and I needed to be on good terms to avoid problems Because of my spree of dating and ghosting I would go through a serious depression every year around Christmas because for some reason I always reflect back that time of the year and think about all the people who I wronged or vice versa Could be because it s a moment where friends and family get together and I m alone almost every year It has been a long time since I dated anybody because I realized that I could not be in a relationship because of my patterns of behavior while in a relationship I have been on my journey in learning to to not lie not be so intimate so fast or seduce and hopefully one day be able to have a healthy relationship built on a strong foundation I was hurting people the way that I was hurt in my life Creating a surge of feelings between myself and them so that I could see them get hurt At that time it brought me happiness to see them suffer I was wrong I know but hear me out I was afraid that they would leave me because after a while people always leave until they wanted something from me That idea stemmed from my childhood to adulthood and I want to challenge that but I know I have to do some self improvement if I want to re engage with people again At the end of it all it saddens me that I potentially could had passed my own trauma onto someone else Thanks for listening if you made it this far,Attacking Behavior
what do u do if ur fp who knows u have bod uses the fact that theyre ur fp against u ex if u dont do _____ for me ill never talk to u again and like ik bc we Äôre both addicts that doesnt help either i just miss when we were hanging out all the time and having fun and doing random stuff idk i just miss my friend but like im also mentallyill so maybe im just making it all up in my head,Attacking Behavior
I like to think of myself as a generally nice person I am super empathetic and a really good listener but when it comes to serious relationships friendships or romantic I become super toxic super fast For example in my current relationship I am always starting fights and saying I want to break up just for attention and reassurance I push him away whenever I sense any little change in behavior But of course I also have extreme attachment issues so I could never actually go through with breaking up with him I am so afraid that he is eventually going to have had enough and leave me He deserves better and I wouldn t blame him but I genuinely don t know if I could make it through that I am trying so hard to stop my bad habits but it s so hard,Attacking Behavior
Sometimes I 20 F think about sending thank you letters or just nice or sweet messages emails to people I like or care about but I get the feeling that they Äôll never respond to me because I Äôm not Äúgood enough Äù or Äúattractive enough Äù for them Even if I send them a thank you letter email I still get the feeling that they won Äôt say anything back to me I know some people don Äôt really check their emails or don Äôt use social media often and are out doing other things with their lives I often wonder if they really like or care about me like how I care about them Maybe or maybe not If they don Äôt respond then I see them as Äúbad people Äù Äúarrogant people Äù or Äúpeople with no heart Äù I think to myself that maybe they don Äôt respect me or appreciate my letter email or maybe they Äôre just arrogant assh les who think they Äôre Äúbetter than me Äù and I hope they rot At the same time I don Äôt mean that and they Äôre probably not how I think they are Idk Idk why but I always felt the need to be liked or loved by other people and to seek their approval I wish I didn Äôt care so much but I do It Äôs like I wasted my love and energy writing and sending these kind letters and emails to people,Attacking Behavior

I don t mean break up with him I mean make things easier for him We play games all of the time that s our way to bond since we are long distance But lately I ve been literally putting so much pressure on myself and him to be better than him I feel like I fail if I m not the top And I ve always been this way if I don t 100 something first try or am not the top or don t get an A I freak out He doesn t deserve that stress Also any time he brings up a new girl that is a shared friend I start to spiral and say things I don t mean I just read on the sub that we should stop normalizing manipulative behaviors having an FP and whatnot But how I feel like I only get really scared and aggressive like this when I m stressed It s like I m so afraid of everything that I m subconsciously trying to make him leave me But I don t want him to leave I don t know what to do anymore I just want things to be better More fun less intense I make everything a fight and I know he s tired but I m tired too It s like I m exhausting the both of us because of how much I m suffering And it s like I want to get better for him but how do I cope How do I get better for MYSELF I just am so tired of making him tired I m tired of him going off of my aggression and hurting my feelings too It s like there is no off switch to the outbursts because I m in constant agony And please don t say anything like we should break up I ve said countless times we should and he doesn t agree I really think we need each other It s not like this all of the time it s just when I m literally so stressed and scared of losing everything I can t just keep apologizing I feel hopeless,Attacking Behavior
I Äôm a teacher and I just got back with my ex next too long ago I didn Äôt go crazy like I usually do when I get broken up with surprisingly but I did love him enough to let him go and be happy A parent of one of my students approached me last week to ask me out on a date and get to know me It Äôs wrong but damn that little bit of attention has made me go CRAZY this parent is way older than me It Äôs the fact that they told me they liked me I shut them down for ethical reasons but I can Äôt stop thinking about it even though I Äôm happy with my ex The parent was non stop pitching themselves to me even though I said no multiple times feels like I Äôm spiraling over this little bit of attention and I don Äôt know how to come out of it,Attacking Behavior
I can Äôt seem to get past my bad trust issues with my husband and it Äôs just getting worse We Äôve been together for four years and in the beginning he used to tell me white lies so he wouldn Äôt hurt my feelings I would always catch him in them and over time it made me feel like I couldn Äôt believe him with much He always said he would stop lying but didn Äôt until just recently so it Äôs hard to believe he actually stopped this time Lately he Äôs had a lot going on for him work stress and he has AS so we haven Äôt been having much of a sex life because he Äôs in pain constantly He also hasn Äôt been very affectionate and always gets frustrated with me easily I feel like he Äôs taking out his other stresses in life on me I think the lack of sex and affection are contributing to my trust issues but I Äôve been understanding about the sex part of it I Äôve always had trust issues because of men in my past and my mom and my dad I don Äôt think he would actually do anything to hurt me but I can Äôt stop overthinking every little thing he ever says or things he does He Äôs a very forgetful person so any time I ask him about something I get an answer that doesn Äôt make much sense or he forgets He always reassures me he Äôs not doing anything but I can Äôt believe him because I know he could be lying about that too I just don Äôt know what to do anymore I feel like I Äôm going insane and like I Äôm a nuisance to him with my trust issues I Äôve tried to leave him but he said that Äôs not an option and we Äôre going to work through this I need advice on what to do when my brain just won Äôt stop,Attacking Behavior
I always see people talk for like HOURS and then I try to imagine what the hell do they talk about so much I mean I tried having friends but most of the time it is so damn painful to talk about basic life stuff like school work family etc it s like I ve already heard one person s life story yours is gonna be basically the same with some small differences I don t care about that and I don t want to share my life with anyone because there s nothing to share I could talk about school work etc too but I DON T CARE about those stuff there s nothing interesting going on in my life nor in your life so what we should talk about I really want to have friends but I swear to god if anyone asks me one of these silly ass bullshit questions one more time I m gonna snap what should I do I can t force myself to talk I tried it s literally hell but then again I can t expect to have friends without introductions and stuff like that but damn I just don t want to talk I just want to hang out why people always want to talk about their nonsense and why they ask about my nonsense it s all just nonsense,Attacking Behavior
i m20 have been diagnosed with bpd for years but when my last relationship ended and over time i began to feel better i rationalized my symptoms as being symptoms of a toxic relationship while the relationship certainly was toxic i also neglected to acknowledge that due to my mostly untreated illness i was toxic too it wasn Äôt just the circumstances a week and a half ago i reached a year since my breakup a year of growth of happiness of self love i had been riding this self reliance induced high for months however i began to feel really isolated part of my recovery from my breakup involved getting comfortable with being alone i had told myself but i had really been isolating myself and keeping everyone i consider a friend Äúclose Äù or not at an arm Äôs length honestly more like two arms and a leg Äôs length all out of what i Äôve just realized was a deep fear of vulnerability born from you guessed it a fear of abandonment shit so the symptoms weren Äôt gone i just express them differently now that i Äôm single awesome well at least it Äôs not affecting anybody else i thought wrong again i started making a point to hang out with people and have friendships outside of surface level work school interactions i wanted to explore sharing deeper parts of myself with others and being vulnerable i Äôve been doing pretty well considering it Äôs been less than 2 weeks but it Äôs already gotten out of hand tonight two of my friends and i were hanging out and we were messing around joking about something i joked just a little too far one of these friends told me he was upset with me which is honesty that i can appreciate but when he asked that i leave him alone i felt this awful familiar feeling bubble up i felt sick to my stomach and like the only way to make it go away was to keep pushing to manipulate him into making me feel better i can Äôt just let him hate me i thought but he clearly stated he didn Äôt hate me he just wanted a little space this seems so small but you have to understand i had been greatly limiting my social interaction over the past year i Äôve now realized this was to avoid the potential for abandonment but at the time i just thought i was self sufficient and independent to choose to let someone in despite being absolutely terrified and then to feel that tiny pang of rejection even if i knew it was temporary and he still loved me made my skin crawl i still left him alone but i only lasted an hour he was so nice to me about it but i know that he felt obligated to comfort me and he shouldn Äôt have had to take care of me because i upset him it all clicked i wasn Äôt magically Äúbetter Äù i was in denial i wasn Äôt Äúfree Äù i was making choices entirely informed by my undercover fear of abandonment for a year straight i feel like curling up in a ball forever i can Äôt believe how naive i was all of this is not to say that i Äôm giving up i have still grown a lot and i still want to be healthy and i believe i can be it just means i was looking at my journey through bpd like it was over and i have a lot further to go than i thought,Attacking Behavior
So last year after my then bf broke up with me with no warning I had huge mental breakdown and was diagnosed with bpd I Äôve had mental health problems my whole life f30 But after this breakup I became something else I couldn Äôt control my actions and I was saying doing anything to try get him back I would devalue him then idolise him I tried every trick in the book to get his attention Back and I Äôm not proud to say a lot of it was manipulation tactics Since my diagnosis I have done so much work on myself really dove deep within I don Äôt enjoy living my life unstable and it Äôs not cute 6 months ago I met someone new and the relationship progressed quite quickly I was secretly terrified of another breakup and was so hesitant to get into something else again but he said all the right things and made me feel ready Fast forward to this week with no prior signs he abruptly ended it with me Initially I reverted back to my usual thought patterns anything to stop them leaving But I made the decision to tell the truth and what Äôs the truth I have bpd and I have abandonment issues I will manipulate and cause mayhem to avoid being abandoned He wants to stay friend Äôs and I have admitted that I would secretly be trying to win him back he needs to block me and I will be seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow I Äôm sad this story is sad but I can see my growth and that feels good üòÉ,Attacking Behavior

I love my wife to death and we just had a crazy past couple of days I highly suspect that she has untreated BPD So the other day she got upset at me over something very minor and did what she usually does which is physically leave and block all forms of communication She spent two nights in a hotel and barely talked to me Yesterday I reached out to her by email telling her I loved her cared about her when she was ready she could talk to me and that I wasn t going anywhere She has other mental health issues and is on medication for them After a little bit of arguing about whether I cared about her she unblocked me on messenger and told me to talk We actually talked and were having good conversation about her her emotions feelings etc Then I said something she didn t like and she started seeing me as the evil person I told her that I would talk to her later when was ready and then stopped answering A little while later I sent her a message to just reassure her that I loved her and cared about her Her response was that she was in the ER in extreme pain I rushed right there When I got there she looked awful and I could tell she was scared she reached out for my hand and I held it Her mom and daughter got there and only one person could be in the room so I asked if she wanted one of them to come back She told me no she wanted me to stay until they find out what s wrong I ended up staying with her throughout all of it Even though she was in a lot of pain she was on pain meds she was pretty happy with me we talked laughed discussed future plans etc After a couple hours they find out its her galbladder and it needs removed immediately They didn t do surgery where we were at so they had to find a place we could transfer to They finally found a place and allowed us to drive ourselves there So we drove there and had to go through admission and wait She continued being happy with me and pretty lovey After an hour or so she finally got taken to surgery I got sent to her room where she would be taken after and I waited for her It was about midnight by the time she got back into the room I stayed up until almost 3 with her making sure everything was okay and seeing if she needed anything she finally fell asleep and then I went to sleep So the hospital we were at is known for not being the best and it showed She ended up self discharging because it was a minor surgery we don t have insurance and the doctors still had not come by to look So since she self discharged we had to go back to the original hospital so she could get it checked out and get her meds Since I only slept about 3 hours she told me to stay home and get some rest and she would have her mom take her I took a nap and when I woke up I was messaging her to see how she was doing She seemed irritated at me I asked her if anyone was there with her and she said no I was about to ask if I could come be with her and she said she was getting discharged so I went to pick her up I had previously messaged her and asked her if she was okay other than being in pain she asked what I meant so I asked if she was sad angry etc She responded with yes so I asked are you sadd which she replied yeah So I asked her what was making her feel sad which she responded everything I then told her she could be more specific Her response was just why followed by I m in the ER why would you think that s appropriate right now So at this point i m completely thrown off because I was just trying to ask if she was okay So I dropped it and went and picked her up She got in the car and I could tell she was angry with me I drove to walmart for her meds and before we got out I just simply ask her what was wrong This set her off she freaked out at me got out of the car and ran off into walmart I followed her because she literally just had surgery and was still on drugs from the hospital I was following her asking her to please calm down and relax She just kept telling me it s basically my fault for her being angry and i m just making her worse So she went to the bathroom and I went back to the car to wait Next thing I know the door to the car flies open and she is ripping her suitcase out and running off with it I followed her begging her to calm down and set the suitcase down she just had surgery and I was worried she was going to hurt herself I kept asking her to just sit down outside walmart and try to calm down She just kept calling me the biggest piece of shit that this is all my fault and i m so awful She had called her mom and told her god knows what her mom flew up and I was trying to tell her mom that she had not taken her medication last night and she also needed her meds from walmart but her mom was just acting like I didn t exist then they flew out of there like I was some maniac or something who just threatened them with a gun Her mom lives across the street so when I got home I tried to go tell her mom what really happened and that she didn t take her medication and needed to get her pain meds and antibiotics from walmart Next thing I know shes on the phone wil 911 and then the police arrive I of course had to tell the police what really happened and that she also missed her medication last night They ended up having EMS come which i m glad they did I have never in my life seen her act this erratic over something so small,Attacking Behavior

Earlier today I went to take a shower as I was weed whacking and covered in dirt and plants Right before I got in my little siblings got back with my stepmom and my sister 6 decided to walk in on me while I was naked and in the middle of starting up the faucet I told her to leave very very embarrassed as I don Äôt handle the idea of being naked even around family very well Moments later I opened the sliding door to grab a washcloth and she was there peeping through the crack between the door and the side of the frame I was even more embarrassed but I came off as extremely angry and called her a bunch of derogatory words like Äúdisgusting Äù and Äúcreepy Äù even though I knew she Äôs just a young kid who was just curious about what I looked like without clothes not knowing the value of privacy The whole time showering I felt like I was being watched and it just made me more and more anxious and I got out and saw her shadow through the crack AGAIN I blew up on her saying I wasn Äôt going to play with her today and she cried and ran away I knew I was acting irrationally and not being truthful about my emotion in the moment but I couldn Äôt help it I could feel my mood doing backflips and felt helpless going against it felt like somehow a 6 year old was judging me and knew she was making me uncomfortable so she did it more to piss me off Anyways thats my ted talk thx for tuning in,Attacking Behavior
Yesterday I went out on a date with a guy I met him at the restaurant I work at on my university campus We really vibed He told me he was a senior like me He asked for my number I gave it to him and we made plans to hang out As we are about to meet he calls me and asks me if I wanted to get some food and that he d pick me up and we d go out to eat I told him I d prefer to stay on campus because I barely knew him He was okay with that During the whole ordeal he was extremely flirtatious nothing wrong with that but given the context of everything else it was weird I told him about how I went to Catholic school and he asked me if I wanted to be a nun I said I thought about it but I didn t want to He said good you re too hot to be a nun We hung out at a table on an empty terrace It was nighttime and most students are gone at that point He asked me if I wanted to dance he mentioned that he liked dancing before I declined After about thirty minutes of talking he asked me if I wanted him to drive me to my car I said no and he walked me to my car He hugged before I left When I got home I looked in the student directory and his name isn t there I ve looked him up anywhere I could find his name or stuff about him and nothing I also learned on the date that he s not 20 22 he s actually 25 so there s that Edit Listen I don t want to say that he s this awful person because I don t know But before I had only known him for five minutes at the restaurant I don t know him I don t know his family Something bad could ve happened if I rode in his car with him Especially since I can t find his name on the student directory For all I know he could be some random guy that just likes to prey on girls,Attacking Behavior
Please point out and forgive any misconceptions in this post I really do not know much about the disorder My roommate and friend of several years has borderline personality disorder he is not medicated yet It seems to be becoming much more of an issue for him lately and it is really tough to try and live with him We are both 19 Some nights he gets super worked up over something as simple as a single cheerio on the floor And when I say worked up he basically just says Fuck you I don t pay talking about rent to deal with your shit clean up I don t want to live in this shithole don t ever talk to me ever again fuck you fuck you I m asking the bare minimum and you can t even do that Another example is I wanted to buy a piece of outdoor gear that he doesn t use I offered a previously agreed upon price but he said Fuck you your so cheap no I m not selling it to you Me ok fine what is a price you think is fair Fuck you get the fuck out of my room I m just going pay 150 yes he knows its that much to ship it to a close friend of both of ours or I ll just throw it out I d rather do that then let you use it All caps would be suitable for the tone used I really don t understand The cheerio thing at least there was a catalyst this one he just exploded I ll admit I got a little worked up too but not till after he had already started yelling I really cannot figure out how to talk to him when he is like this No matter what I say he just gets angrier and angrier until eventually he says something intentionally offensive to me and I get mad or he makes me feel so insignificant to him I just leave I know some suggestions might be to just exit the room and leave until he calms down but until he succeeds in offending me or making me feel bad he will not let it go he will follow me and I don t really want to leave the house every time he gets mad I don t have time for that and I don t pay rent for that It is very hit and miss though some days he s like the guy I met 7 years ago other days I have absolutely no idea wtf is going on or who he is Sometimes he will change in a matter of hours but it s always from funny fruity happy incredibly kind to fucking pissed and actively trying to blow up all his relationships HOW DO I DEAL WITH THIS Any advice is very much appreciated I really want to get back on good terms with him and not feel like I m flipping a coin when I try to talk to him Inevitably when it does land on tails I want to be able to calm him down before he escalates Any tips on how to recognize times when a tail flip is inevitable would be great too Also any ways I could support him through it TLDR My friend roommate with borderline personality disorder is getting more and more atomically reactive lately and I am looking for advice on how to deal with him before he explodes when he explodes after he explodes and how to recognize signs of instability to avoid the explosions altogether or at least be aware of when a bomb suit may be required We are both 19 he wasn t like this a year ago and it has been really tough watching him go through this and develop more and more symptoms,Attacking Behavior
So diagnosed BPD here and I know over the years I ve fluctuates between an absolute mess to you can t even tell However currently I m sort of noticing my symptoms getting a lot more severe The reason being that a family member of mine has been physically assuaktimg me and telling me to end my life My family is worried and wants me to move out of state Honestly it doesn t sound like a bad idea since this family has been very violent the cost of living in the other state would be much cheaper However what I m worried about is my untreated BPD and just moving Is that somethinf that is just doomed to fail I mean it s like I do sort of have to move but how will I manage my symptoms which are getting more pronounced while also juggling a whole new environment and all that Is there a chance that a fresh start and move will help in the short term with some of my fears of abandonment or will it only make me more hostile and angry Idk Any advice or perspective is greatly appreciated,Attacking Behavior
THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG ONE OH BOY Hi everyone I was diagnosed with BPD just last year after being with symptoms for the longest freaking time I Äôve had crushes in the past but none quite as intense as the one I have on someone I Äôve known for eight years We started out as friends and ended in a weird relationship where we basically acted as a couple but never had an official label on ourselves This relationship lasted about a year and a half I was obsessed with him to the point I made him the center of my attention almost every single day until I had to move away for personal and educational reasons Fast forward a year later I was back in my hometown and decided to visit my friends in my old school He had been my FP for a long time I obsessively bought him gifts blocked him out and got mad when he talked to another girl cried when his tone changed on me and because I didn Äôt know myself I basically mimicked his likes and dislikes Despite the fact I showed cleared signs of being unstable he accepted me and cared for me He lived an hour from the school and had to get there an hour before classes started to avoid morning traffic and I who lived 5 mins away decided to start going to school earlier to get more time with him Anyways I didn Äôt tell him I was gonna visit so I could surprise him and ended up being shocked that when I was in the car and pulling up to school that he was being really touchy feely and laughing with another girl I decided against seeing anyone and instead went on to send him a message that night I made up an excuse as to why I was in the area and casually mentioned I saw him with the other girl He made it very clear that they weren Äôt anything special or anywhere remotely close to dating I was kind of relieved and decided to build up the courage to officially ask him out as I thought I had a chance since he called me by the pet name he called me when we were in a Äúrelationship Äù Before I brought up my actual feelings he made it perfectly clear that he will not be dating anyone in the present or near future I got so mad I ended the conversation right there and then and didn Äôt talk to him for years talk about obsession to hatred Äî splitting much haha Anyways after him I didn Äôt even try to get into any other relationship I flirted and went on dates Äî this usually leads to a period of obsession with the person I date to absolute repulsion that I end up getting rid of them from my life entirely But I haven Äôt stopped stalking my crush despite the years of disconnection and that Äôs how I figured out he was dating someone I knew don Äôt even wanna get into the shit I did to numb the feeling of devastation lol Cut to today I saw that they took down all the posts they have of each other and unfriended and unfollowed one another in all social medias So I need advice Do I tell him my feelings or try to move on from him Right now my current FP is my best friend and I Äôm in the middle of some sort of splitting episode and have not talked to her in weeks because I have this burning hatred towards her for whatever reason SO GUYS What do I do idk if this is relevant to you guys giving advice but I recently discovered that his sister is going out with my brother so idk how that Äôs gonna play out guess liking that family runs in my family lol,Attacking Behavior
I got the BPD diagnosis forced on me by a partner It sent me into reactive abuse and I took my distance I can think clearly now and I decided to visit this place to see what could have made him think this way and the more I read the more I think BPD and other mental illnesses became a joker for lame partners I ll explain I am not denying BPD and how it can hurt the person with BPD and the family members or partners What I am talking about is how people are using BPD as the new narcissist joker NPD is a real thing and narcissists are making people s life a living hell But people started calling each other narcissist almost as an insult and started to force armchair diagnosis on people who pissed them off And I feel like people are using BPD the same way For example someone here commented how her BF stopped answering her messages when she told him she was feeling sad But if she texted something random right after he would react to that random thing while still ignoring the sad comment How is that unhealthy to feel hurt by that How is that a BPD thing to know your partner thinks your sadness is a burden How is it unhealthy feel saddened by the fact your partner feels like your feelings are a burden The partner I mentioned that tried to stick the BPD label on me was autistic He went out of his way to tell me you try to sabotage a healthy relationship and when I reminded him that I was the one who implemented many communication exercises and breaks for us to think clearly etc in our conversation therefore how is that sabotaging He had nothing else to say The same guy who I sacrificed energy and time for when he needed me he cried he asked for me to spend time with him call him at work etc told me when I needed him to do the same for me that it was too hard to do the same for me that I was stronger than him that I was too difficult to love sic Hearing those things hurt like crazy I told him how horrible it is to say to someone and I feel used now I feel like he used me as some kind of emotional bandage dispenser and he could not love me he just loved how I made him feel and when I called him out on this he realized that the dispenser was empty and he started to pull the silent treatment on me I got super sad bc I could not believe he was the same man I tried to reach him everywhere and that is the part where if anyone looked at my behavior from outside with no context they d think he is right look she is spamming him I have some issues physically that are triggered by stress so I wanted him to stop pulling the silence treatment on me and we should break up in a calm way to have closure But he refused he blocked me and he laughed at me for crying telling me I sounded like a teenager and that I was beyond help and needed to leave him the f ck alone I had medical help and came back from the clininc feeling better Told him that and told him I would leave then He contacted me Telling me he felt bad bc of personal issues He wanted me to comfort him and for me to not leave See this They are the issue and they create a trauma bond I tried to help him as best as I could knowing this guy would not do the same thing for me then refused to stay while trying not to trigger anything mean from him as I was still fragile And I am only summarizing all the hurtful things here I had a therapist talk to me I explained all the situation he also said it was a sad but normal reaction Anger and sadness are normal emotions Anger is not BPD because a woman is showcasing it End of rant,Attacking Behavior
hey everyone my FP M21 which i Äôve just married and been with for 5 years has ADHD and depression I F21 have bpd and as you know Ä i Äôm idealizing my FP and putting him a divine lvl Anyways I started therapy for the first time and i Äôm hoping to have my bpd under complete control and stabilization So to get to the point Ä Idk if I have unrealistic expectations of my FP So here Äôs the big deal he isn Äôt sexually satisfied with me anymore Might be due to his ADHD or something but yeah he basically don Äôt compliment me anymore don Äôt engage in sexual activities anymore but he says he wants to have sex with other women cause it got repetitive and boring with just one person Me and my FP are each other Äôs only bodies in our entire lives Idk what to think of that I mean you know it obviously breaks my heart but on the other hand he says that i have unrealistic expectations of him because of my BPD for not accepting this type of behavior Now I do not mind him being abstinent or masturbating however him wanting other women but not his own is really making me have nightmares and breakdowns However he said that it Äôs his nature and it will never change and he refuses to attempt changing it He gets extremely angry whenever i bring it up or when i cry about it Note I was okay with playing along with any fantasies that he has But just talking about it to him makes it want it more and more in real life and he isn Äôt interested in me sexually anymore so And his sexual frustrations result in an overall bad mood no attention or closure or intimacy or touch,Attacking Behavior
I would ask for all those people who abused me and people who tell me it s all in my head to be diagnosed with BPD and AVPD I know I must ask for this illness to go away but i just want to see how they handle what i have I am ready to bear the pain just to see them go through it all,Attacking Behavior
Hi all I also posted this in the bipolar sub so for those of you who also have a full mental health dance card and already saw this feel free to ignore Anywho so I Äôve been under a lot of stress recently and felt like I needed more support so I found this practice that offered a lot of different services I was really interested in for example a wise mind group I reached out and did intake and had a psych appointment The psych wanted more info so they had their office send me a follow up email In the follow up email I realized they had saved my contact info as an Apple ID called Mood Killer I come from a techy family and my boyfriend works in tech and we Äôve all concluded that the nickname could not have been from my end Ä Tl dr new mental health practice nicknamed me Mood Killer internally and accidentally shared it externally,Attacking Behavior
Quick question are you all whores who manipulate gaslight and cheat JUST because you can I didn Äôt know such horrible people could exist until I had the pleasure of dating one Every ounce of goodness was used against me and I was built up just to be broken down again Now I have severe trust issues and am afraid I Äôll never be able to trust another women fully again Thanks,Attacking Behavior
My girlfriend has BPD and I struggle with depression I feel as though dating her has made me more depressed I often feel that she is controlling and can lash out in really hurtful ways when I do things she doesn Äôt like I don Äôt have anyone to talk to about our relationship problems because she doesn Äôt think it Äôs anyone else Äôs business but I truly don Äôt know what to do or how to handle her at times She frequently sets limitations on the things I can do for admittedly no reason she Äôs admitted it comes from her own insecurities and nothing that i Äôve done Who I follow how I interact with other women and so on I often find that she has a lot of double standards for me i e she can follow this person but I can Äôt because their content isn Äôt something i Äôd normally like A lot of the boundaries are things I wouldn Äôt even do in the first place but it Äôs frustrating for her to make a big show about preventing me from doing something and then doing it herself I admit that i Äôm not perfect and that I can lose my temper and get snappy But she Äôs my first girlfriend and when things get rough and I beg her to go to therapy to manage her BPD nothing ever happens I feel as though I Äôve grown to resent her and any time I try to set my own boundaries or set my own guidelines it turns into an exhausting fight where she undoubtedly will shutdown and cry It Äôs extremely emotionally draining for me I Äôve told her many times before I don Äôt like how she sets these limits on me and makes passive aggressive comments at me and she Äôll promise to let up but she never does I sometimes feel like even though i Äôm an adult i Äôve just found someone else who limits my freedom and monitors all my interactions and leaves me no privacy like my parents did growing up I just feel constantly disrespected and brushed off because she has BPD and I have no idea what it Äôs like I try my best to research but it Äôs hard when she never gives me any of that same energy Idk this will probably get lost and then deleted I just need help on establishing boundaries Sorry if this is scattered feel free to ask any questions,Attacking Behavior
Like seriously I always get so freaked out and so scared that my fp is dead when he doesn Äôt text me back At first all be like Äúis he dead Äù in kind of a joking way but then I Äôll actually get serious Sometimes I Äôll constantly stalk instagram to see if he was active or call him from a blocked number a bunch of times to see if he Äôll answer cause I actually think that he died,Attacking Behavior
I Äôm a monster No not like the movies or story books It Äôs a monster inside of me That sleeps soundly Till it Äôs awoken and you Äôd best be prepared Because the smallest mistake Will draw it in The slightest shift in attitude Will cause it Äôs hairs to stand on edge And the slightest feeling Of the dreadful abandonment it so greatly fears The beast will attack With no remorse for who you were to it just moments ago Friends family lover mean nothing to this monstrosity You see this monster is blind Blinded by the hate and rage That burns it Äôs entire being All you are is the target Even if you had done no wrong Because who could calm a blinded beast With a taste for the destruction of the ones we hold close I am a monster But not by choice For if I could get rid of this beast And banish it from mind for good I would have slain the dreaded thing years ago When I first learned Of the monster in me,Attacking Behavior
I f22 have bpd and I live with my partner m21 and his friend m24 I can Äôt stand his friend He steals and lies and is a jerk It Äôs gotten to the point and I know this is irrational but it Äôs gotten to the point where I enter a rage episode when I hear them even taking to each other I hate him so much and I want my partner to hate him too I need help being rational right now because I just had a really bad episode over them talking in the kitchen I asked my partner if he could get me a beer out of the kitchen because I didn Äôt want to be in the kitchen around his friend He ended up talking to him for quite a while and I literally wanted to go out there and explode on them I texted my partner some heinous embarrassing things and I regret it but I also don Äôt because I Äôm still in this episode I just need some advice I have to live with both of them and I don Äôt know how to cope other than drinking which is bad I know I know that I Äôm irrational and I Äôm trying so hard to change so if you come at me with any negative comments you will immediately be reported and blocked,Attacking Behavior

So in the last few months I Äôve been seeing my colleague who I suspect REALLY hard that he has NPD Even he agreed that he lives for attention he has sometimes thoughts he Äôs better that others but sometimes he feels guilty about it He Äôs a really nice person overall and I enjoyed spending time with him Recently I told him about how I feel and that I was wondering if he Äôs interested in me because sometimes he Äôs really happy around me and the second after he just blocks and don Äôt talk anymore He told me that he Äôs scared to become attached to me and to grow feelings for me because he wants to stay alone and that is why he acts this way After this talk I started to protect myself this red flag is just to common and as many of you might have already experienced people like him might just use me for attentions and suck the life out of me til they get bored and change person So I stopped giving him attention any look or smile always being respectful and talking to him with a smile In the last two days he started to break though he continues to tell me he can Äôt handle it anymore that he doesn Äôt understand why I act like this and begged me to stop Yesterday he went to the Äòangry phase Äô and started yelling at me that I need to stop and that its too painful for him just to come back after five minutes and yell in my ear Äòit Äôs fucking stupid I don Äôt give a fuck Äô and during the service he yelled me Äònow that we Äôre like strangers I Äôll have to call you by your last name Äô making the manager come over to tell him to calm down Making quite a spectacle for the kids there since I work at Disney ahaha Now he Äôs really handsome and many people try to hit on him all the time I just can Äôt understand now if he Äôs just abstinent from my attentions or if he Äôs actually interested and honestly sad for the situation,Attacking Behavior
For context I am 19F and my partner is 28M He triggers me without meaning to and I go into a black out rage He insists on staying together but I feel it would be best if he left me and found someone who wasn Äôt mentally ill I keep ruining our relationship as hard as I try not to I Äôm volatile We Äôve had arguments where we both say hurtful things and he Äôs gotten himself in check mostly but sometimes I Äôm the one that says disgustingly hurtful things amp he Äôs completely innocent After these fights I feel immense guilt and I apologize profusely Last night we had a fight where I said some of the meanest things I Äôve ever said to him because he accused me of lying when I wasn Äôt I made him cry He still wants to be together but I don Äôt think it Äôs healthy to be with someone like me romantically until I get treatment How do I stop ruining my relationships,Attacking Behavior
Hi all posting here hoping for some insight A few years ago I ended a friendship with someone who had told multiple people they were diagnosed BPD This friend was a very seemingly loving person caring empathetic and seemed to have a strange amount of things in common with me some of which have been confirmed by others some not They had a small close group of long time friends and a partner of about 8 years We stopped being friends because 1 I was going through my own mental health crisis and treating people around me rather poorly and 2 I found out they had been lying to me about something I considered hurtful and unnecessary to lie about In summary after this my former friend began slowly turning others against me including one of my siblings and two of my close friends From one of those friends it seemed like this person Äúwanted to destroy you They wanted to find out where you worked when you moved and get you fired Äù They apparently said on multiple occasions they wished I was dead etc Does this actually sound like BPD to you all This went on actively for a while and I Äôm obviously not innocent and said my fair share of awful things to them after the friendship officially ended If this does sound like BPD can anyone explain the intense hatred that they would actively try to Äúdestroy Äù me Thank you for taking the time to read and respond,Attacking Behavior
Title sums it up I Äôll keep anger in me without letting it out until everything comes out one day when I Äôm unaware of it But because of that I often find my anger crisis to be a shit show with lot of swearing to people who did not deserve it and a lot of that anger directed towards my furnitures,Attacking Behavior
The other day I was telling my boyfriend I wanted plastic surgery on my body butt job and I was showing him pictures of what I wanted He said Äúdamn Äù in response to one of the pictures and it made me feel really bad about myself and insecure because I want surgery for a reason In response I started throwing his clothes at him and telling him to leave He got really upset not realizing how big of a deal it was to me He was so angry and kept saying ÄúI feel like i Äôm going to lose you in those moments Äù and that i Äôm hurting him by acting that way that it Äôs like I Äúflip a switch and its like its the end of the world Äù but I just wanted to push him away before he could make me more insecure but really it was just my own insecurities However I think any female would react unfavorably towards a comment like that Last time we fought it was because a girl messaged him but he didn Äôt even message her back I just couldnt help but not trust him He Äôs proven his loyalty constantly and never done anything wrong to me ever but I got so scared when he was angry I have never seen him get this angry before it made me feel terrible I don Äôt want to feel like a burden because of my insecurities I feel embarrassed and like i Äôm being bad to him But its never my intention to hurt I just wanted to be alone because I was fine before he triggered me I don Äôt get it how do I stop hurting him and hurting my own feelings with my self esteem and worst case scenarios Should we even be together if i Äôm hurting him like this,Attacking Behavior
My best friend and I have been close since the 7th grade We Äôre now 29 and run a summer camp as co coordinators during the month of July with a committee of two other friends who work as teaching staff at the camp amp x200B In a casual conversation last Sunday we started talking about camp and collectively realized omg it Äôs February already we really should start planning our first committee meeting amp x200B I just started a new job last week and now have a bunch more spare time than him so I asked if he wanted me to send an email to get a feel for everyone Äôs schedule to which he said Äúyeah sounds great Äù amp x200B Fastforward to Tuesday evening I send the email and everyone replies on Wednesday saying Saturday is a good day to meet Nobody says a specific time window except one colleague who says Äúnothing after 8pm Äù amp x200B I send out a followup to the group suggesting a specific time which reads as follows ÄúIt Äôs looking like Saturday is our best option With that in mind how about a call this Saturday the 12th at 4pm Would that work for everyone Äù amp x200B My bestie and co coordinator replies 10 minutes later ÄúAwesome Since Saturday works for everyone let s say we meet at 12 30pm this Saturday the 12th in a Facebook Messenger call Hope that works for everyone but if not let me know Äú amp x200B At this point logically I know he probably just didn Äôt read my message and therefore didn Äôt realize I was finalizing things but I Äôm fucking livid Why do I bother taking any initiative when my gestures in leadership are going to be downplayed in the best case ignored in the medium case or outright undermined all together in the worst amp x200B I then sent a self depricating but ultimately passive aggressive text knowing as a feeling type he Äôll realize what he did Äú Hey How can I retract my 4pm message Sorry I should ve consulted you about the specific time first before just barfing one out there like that Äù amp x200B He hasn Äôt responded it Äôs after midnight here so fair enough but am I the asshole emotionally immature for reading this much intent into a petty ass email exchange,Attacking Behavior
When I Äôm in love that person becomes my god Then I discover something about them that distorts that image and I start to judge them and it creates a conflict inside me that feels like torture Half of them is all I want and half of them I hate When We Äôre healthy we can have positive and intimate moments but the negativity stays fresh and nibbles on my brain until I break down and insult hurt my partner And when I leave them or do something crazy I miss them and deal with fear because I want them back and I do anything I can to make it happen I hate emotions and I hate love and I hate hatred I don Äôt want to feel anything at all anymore I don Äôt even know who I am I always am someone else depending on who I Äôm with or around I have two options Keep living with my emotions and use them in the cage to destroy people and inflict the pain I feel inside on them Become a beast so I don Äôt feel the pain of my humanity Or to kill my emotions and I don Äôt know what would result of that but maybe it Äôs better than what I already do WHERE IS HOPE AND LOVE DOES IT EXIST IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE FOR US,Attacking Behavior
Yesterday not only was I introduced as his property to a new friend neighbour but he also stood over me screaming Äúf you Äù And Äúyou definitely have bpd Äù and Äúthis is the line that you do not cross so you either break up with me or take accountability for your actions and acknowledge that you Äôre misbehaving Äù All I did was respond to a Facebook message from someone I had a very brief thing with like 5 years ago about how I managed in hurricane Fiona I live in Eastern Canada I thought I should answer as this guy has children and because it Äôs an obvious thing to not ignore I was told by my bf that it was flirting and it always leads to more I keep replaying it all in my head and I don Äôt know what to think Ä he also says our future kids can never meet my family and that he dislikes my friends I feel alienated Also he said that I have to discuss this incident with my doctor psychiatrist as I need to work on myself He threw something when he got angry also and it Äôs not the first time he has done that during an argument Please help,Attacking Behavior

Hi this is an update to a post I made a few days ago I Äôll try to link it but I Äôm on mobile so no promises Äî Äî Äî Äî Äî Äî First I want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to respond and share their insight We have been going through a difficult time and some users have helped me find clarity I think a lot of people are misinterpreting saying my gf is blaming her BPD and that Äôs why she felt compelled to sleep with this guy She never said that I never said that BPD was the cause After talking more I don Äôt think she cheated on me She said she felt compelled as a trauma response specifically SEXUAL trauma One user said that it might have been a fawn freeze reaction Something I didn Äôt mention is that this guy has pressured her to have sex in the past GF has an extremely hard time setting boundaries and saying no due to the sexual trauma she experienced And although he didn Äôt outright ask this time his insistence was more than she let on initially I think she was afraid of saying no Does he know that Maybe he Äôs a shitty person But she was scared and uncomfortable She wasnt completely consenting but she lied kept secrets and involved our friends into this situation I have no idea why she repeatedly put herself in the same space as this guy but apparently with fawn people pleasing is a symptom She also says that she had a feeling of dread and fear that something bad was going to happen if she didn Äôt sleep with him I wish she would Äôve came to me but feeling vulnerable and scared of your own mind losing your partner from a mistake is another thing I Äôve commonly heard I don Äôt know if I can ever trust her again because I knew this guy was bad news and I asked her not to see him We were all formerly friends and had a falling out She lied and that Äôs that Maybe she Äôs splitting or feeling that her needs aren Äôt met or losing feelings or she never loved me She says she loves me but she could be lying Who knows I can trust her Also I would like to say that just because you have BPD and don Äôt cheat doesn Äôt mean BPD isn Äôt a factor No hate I Äôm coming here with an open mind People with BPD have a higher propensity to cheating and that can be for many reasons It Äôs statistics I Äôm not judging or shaming anyone I Äôm not vilifying cheaters I Äôm not saying BPD makes you do anything At the end of the day people cheat for many reasons Trauma response hyper sexual tendencies are definitely a factor and more common with those who have BPD compared to the general population Again thank you to everyone who left helpful or insightful comments and shared their experiences,Attacking Behavior

Well I posted before about this friend before but I officially lost them yesterday after trying to be more open and talk it out because we couldn t see eye to eye I m not bothered about losing them tbh what I didn t include before was that due to my initial feeling unheard I snapped on them and used some of their worst insecurities against them I guess I felt like I needed to regain power Well anyways I lost them but I was very toxic and I think this was for the best Personally it s very hard for me to make emotional connections so I don t feel that much for them anyway I m stoll so sorry they had to go through that no one should ever go through that I extra feel bad because I was always preaching to them not to take anyone s shit that if someone doesn t respect you you should leave nobody should be allowed to make you feel like shit etc etc Even without them here I still believe that But what I realizing is that I felt like I needed and ultimatum or to be at this emotional peak a constant emotional high And I m realizing I see things in two different ways Like my logically writing this I am on the outside looking in at whoever drove this friend away I m so deattatched from my emotions it doesn t even feel like me when I m doing it so I m able to bounce back very quickly It s almost like it never happened at all on my end I m never try to shuck of responsibility or anything bc I was horrible and toxic idk how I m still friends with the rest none of the rest of the group has said anything but they may never to avoid conflict and just keep it within their own group My bf he s still with me idk fir how much longer But it was all in the end a self fulfilling prophecy one that I can t even bother to throw a pity party for Thinking about this is eyeroll inducing bc ok congrats you fucked it up life moves on You still have an upwards for 70 90 years left of your life nothing is forever yk anyways if yall wanna leave input you can Can I ask a question DAE feel like logic and emotions are so separate for you,Attacking Behavior

Disclaimer I writing this for myself in a place where people might be able to provide some perspective or not This is going to be stream of consciousness about me meeting one of the most marvellous persons I Äôve ever met and where we got to so far I don Äôt have bpd she does It does not define her it Äôs part of her and I love all of her We are both imperfect individuals like everyone else maybe more I know she is on reddit but i dont know her username I don Äôt know if she will read this but I dont mind if she does In case she does feel free to judge me be nice to her A couple of months ago I met a girl in a pretty unconventional way We are both over 30 with history and baggage and very good careers We ended up going for drinks one night i did not expect anything to come from it but I really liked the person I met She is gorgeous but that was just a footnote what drawn me to her was her personality her uncommon intelligence and wit her depth and that big loving hearth of hers that she desperately tries to hide from the world That night we ended up having sex it was forgettable what was not forgettable was the special person i had met by a strange chance of destiny I did not expect anything to follow but i was drawn to her and we started chatting lightly as friends Important context those days we were both in pretty bad places with our lives From my side i was in a dead relationship that had been dragging for years A woman I cared about but we grow progressively apart of the last decade and have little left in common besides our past and our pets From her side she had just gone through some pretty awful events in her personal and professional life and to overcome some of those she was putting herself through other painful experiences that were clearly taxing on her mind I am usually pretty withdrawn and have huge shields around me when it comes to sharing what i feel but for some reasons i have never had those with her While we were chatting to each other and getting to know each other we were very open and honest about what was weighting us down This way we slowly got to know each other over about a month Bit by bit leading to bigger things and we were genuinely there for each other I like to think my friendly listening ear helped her through a hard period and I know her presence helped me in a different way For a while it felt she was not really interested in my life and the help went only one way but then it changed Even during that first unilateral phase her presence and friendship were great help for me She told me about her BPD very early on I researched a lot about it spent time reading life experiences here read papers and testimonials I even stumbled into the hate sub and discounted it quite easily that was not and is not her Maybe im naive but the condition does not define her yes the mood swings and rage moments are there and visible but i see the person behind them even when they are at their worst and i know she can get better I tried to be there and hold her hand through some of them and welcome back when they were done trying to make sure she did not feel too bad about the minor things she might have said during those It Äôs not easy but she is worth it Guess what feelings developed on both sides And on both sides we tried really hard not to show them too much But after a while the ÄòI like you Äô turned into what they really were She was the first suggesting a meeting in the future and that gave me the confidence to try suggesting meetings in the short term we ended up meeting for a coffee next to her work It was cute both nervous like silly teenagers after texting for about a month Yes the wonderful person i had got to know texting was real and she was not different in person under the august sun Once you meet in person you kind of open the floodgates and we started meeting more often at least weekly This is were our respective issues made things more difficult She is unfortunately addicted to alcohol She is trying to fight it i see it but obviously it is not easy Alcohol can make her Äòbad splits Äô pretty unpleasant but i am still not judging or changing my views about her Addiction is a struggle and I know she has the strength to get out of it if she really wants to Hopefully it happens before it destroys the brilliant career she has in front of her On my side im not a saint either While my Äòprevious Äô relationship is dead and has been dead for years i still live with her And I do care in a way for that person given the long time we have been living together and our history I dont want to hurt her too much and the process of getting her out to allow me to be next to my new soulmate has been taking longer than it should have After a month there is still no clear date she will be out of the picture My fault i should have the balls to push it But life happens and things slip if i have to travel work hard be with my new friend etc Also not to justify but to provide perspective many times when i had gathered the strength to accelerate the exit process somehow my new potential gf had a bad day and spent a whole night telling me i had no chance with her how her exes were better or that i should leave her alone forever I know the next morning all those silly things were gone but they did leave a bad taste and dampen my decisiveness irrationally We are so different that we complete each other in a way And so similar in other ways no she is not mirroring me she is her own wel defined complex person with a past of toxic relationship and abuse Her past weights on her it is hard including dramatic events that happened just a few weeks ago But her past made her the gorgeous person she is today even if with some scars that still need healing Long story short i had an important 4day long weekend abroad i had been waiting for for months recently and i wanted her to come with me Spend full days and nights together for the first time She could not come pity but not a big deal so i left alone 3 days out of 4 were spent in a drinking bender that ended up into very black feelings towards me One day was very white and loving it also happened to be my birthday incidentally I spent those days talking to her trying to softly bring her back from the dark place she was in I think talking is soothing for her while she is having those bad moments I asked her if it is true she did not say if it is or it isn Äôt So i keep trying to help her the only way i can Now im back in town It is only been a month since we opened up to each other about our feelings but the fact my previous relationship still has my ex living with me still seems to be unbearable to her I was determined to act but I was late Ä she contacted my ex on social media and she was pretty awful to her I should be angry but im not I am disappointed and scared it might be indicative of things to come And i dont want to start something based on the result of an episode and blackmail Ä i want to talk to her while she is calm and positive work things out and see if we can build something important on healthy and stable foundations Unfortunately now is ashamed sad maybe angry with both me and herself I don Äôt know how things will progress I will try to give her all the space she needs hoping she does not decide to forget me while i give her space I know she is capable to do that but again it Äôs a risk i am willing to take Maybe my slow ish progress on my side made us lose the opportunity to have something good Patience is not one of her strong qualities and fast decision making is not one of mine Maybe we will find our own way to happiness together who knows What i know is that she is a special wonderful girl She only needs to find a way to beat alcohol and maybe accept that therapy can help her while at the moment she is utterly convinced it does not work on her Sorry for the long ramblings I love this woman People are imperfect and relationships are difficult BPD is only one of the things that can make them difficult but it is not an insurmountable problem All situation is different but everyone can find a way to be happy Darlingbabe you probably wont read this but if you do and recognise yourself remember one thing I do love you and whatever happens in the future at the very least you have a friend who will always be on your side,Attacking

Hello I have showed BPD traits in my past relationships I was married for 8 years I fell in love again with someone who had similar musical interests like me In the beginning we both were so convinced that we were right for each other üò As time passed I realized she was trying to manipulate me into getting things done the way she wants I have had these love hate cycles when I was with her I wanted to leave but I didn t have the courage I was scared of being alone She showed traits of vulnerable narcissist like gaslighting hypersensitive to criticism She also said the relationships in the past failed because all those guys were losers and had financial or some other problems I should have paused and thought rationally if that was really the whole truth All this I realized later and not during the relationship I didn t even set boundaries and accepted everything because I thought things might change with time When I felt manipulated or yelled at more than once I have let my rage out said mean hurtful contemptuous things which made her scared This happened 3 times in total and now we re separated She was pregnant with my kid the last time it happened and she had a miscarriage in the 3rd month She hates me and doesn t want to see me again Now she acts like there was nothing ever there between us It really hurts because I took this huge gamble to end the relationship with my wife and sell our co owned flat And now I m alone It hurts üò I m in therapy now after the break up and the therapist said I have NPD traits But I believe it s a mix of some BPD and NPD traits These traits surface only during romantic relationships not otherwise And also not always So is this mild BPD I have started meditation again Do you guys have any other helpful tips that might help,Attacking Behavior
I 19f have a close friend Mark at college and I hooked up with his best friend Randy at home over the summer I thought Randy had a good time but a mutual made a comment that implied he was telling people that it was bad Which is humiliating and devastating to me because I hate myself and my body so much and the only solace I can find is knowing that at least some people want me sexually I am having a lot of emotions and my preferred method of communication is suppressing everything and engaging in self destructive behavior hoping someone will notice and ask I really want to start a fight with Mark about it and blame him for talking about me behind my back with Randy even though I have no evidence that he did and if so he probably didn t even say anything bad about me I am upset at Randy but we re not friends so I can t say anything to him Getting mad at Mark would be good because I could get my emotions out and it s self destructive as well because I am currently trying to drive everyone away from me The other night me and mark got really drunk and I kept making hints thatI was mad at him He asked me what it is and I refused to tell him so he was a bit bothered by it but we made up Now I want to tell him because I need someone to tell me that I still have worth despite having an ugly body and being bad at sex But it s also so embarrassing that I can t even say it out loud I know that s not the right thing to do but I don t see another option black and white thinking I have no idea how to use proper communication and I don t even know where to start now that I m out of DBT also because most of the situation is in my head not based in reality I hate saying serious things over text but I have never used DEARMAN skills Also I completed a DBT program two years ago and am being treated for depression Never diagnosed with BPD but I see myself acting like some of the symptoms,Attacking Behavior
I ve always been a big fan of love the feeling of being loved wanted desired to die and to live for So I always thought about the right person too the person that is perfect for you the one that loves your qualities and knows your bad habits and stays anyways I grow up reading romantic shit not that I was in a deep wish to being in a relationship maybe it was a way to me to feel a bit of something that I have never felt I never craved love until I met a later FP I had a lot of FPs before I even knew what was one I had always a romantic relationship with them And then I met the one that I know for longer it lasted longer because we were deeply traumatized people she needed me as I needed her we met when we were just children entering the young phase And then we Äúfell in love Äù and we got into a relationship the fact is I don t even know if I loved her back then she needed my attention and I didn t wish for her to leave me a relationship was my idea of keeping her around Back then I thought that It was love but now I know she was my favorite person she loved me and I felt safe around her but she didn t receive love from my side I was obsessive I wanted her to be well but not well enough to change mind and leave me I wanted to talk to her every time but just to keep her thinking about me I wanted her to be better but not more than me I wanted someone that was there for me because if not so I ll be feeling alone That was not love I cared for her a lot I loved her in a disturbing terrible way that s the scariest part it doesn t feel wrong to me to love someone like this But I know that this is not love love doesn t hurt emotionally like I did for me it feels like I ll never know what love is truly like And I find it funny because I was not loved healthily and now I can t love too,Attacking Behavior

A guy met me when I was at my lowest times I been mentally been struggling with it for the past 2 years was going through intense stress abuse which caused paranoia Sadly the first impression went awful By the time I fell for him it was too late He saw the worse part of me and wasn Äôt affectionate with me anymore nor call me everyday like he use to Me realizing I missed the chance of being with the love of my life cause me to double down Which means I would still do crazy things like before such as blowing his phone whenever I felt hurt or neglected Whenever he sees me and we fuck I would naively think that him coming over could be a chance he would like me and talk to me like he use to But once I AGAIN get the realization that things won Äôt be the same before I get sad and blame myself for making him not be interested in me in THAT WAY anymore This will then trigger me to blow his phone up so I can hear his voice even if he was mad I would think that the method is useful since he would something fuck me right after I do it But he recently said having sex with me is independent of me blowing his phone up And that he may fuck me but he won Äôt forget that I blew his phone and will still be resentful Yes he has treated like shit when I continued Called me ugly cause I wouldn Äôt leave him alone I once spent money on a hotel to see him just for him to tell me we aren Äôt talking for a few months And then proceed to fuck me in the suite right after I cry But it Äôs my fault because I kept blowing his phone Ofc he will treat me poorly He would have me pay money 200 as a punishment for blowing his phone He said he didn Äôt want the money he wanted me to suffer the consequences People tell me he is not a trustworthy guy including his best friend And other people told me he would treated me this way eventually regardless But I can Äôt stop blaming myself that he treats me differently because of the first impression He would have been the untrustworthy guy who likes me Even him told me he treats me differently because I Äôd my first impression I keep blaming myself I was wondering if I take part of the blame to why he isn Äôt as affectionate with me anymore,Attacking Behavior

I am absolutely terrified that I am going to be fired from my job very soon here Let me give context Also I might ramble and info dump too much so I m sorry if it s hard to piece all this information together Another thing almost everything I mention might be hard to take seriously and I am pretty embarrassed about that üíÄ My schedule was recently changed My hours this upcoming week have been reduced to 25 hours throughout the entire week I only have four days Each shift is about 5 6 hours and I should be working full time I ve noticed that I have absolutely no days at all where I work with one coworker in particular Me and this coworker tend to clash He however has a history of being problematic so I m not just some problem myself I was told that the reasoning behind my hours being changed was that I m being transitioned into day shifts instead of night shifts because some coworker I do not know wants to do night shifts so they decided to go ahead and put her on night shifts and me at day shifts I have a hard time believing this Anyways about this coworker I clash with He teases people to such an extreme extent and claims that it s just his way of being friendly He will insult you and your interests argue with you be condescending criticize your work and self project onto you If you tell him to stop and assert yourself he will not take you seriously and he will continue He never admits to being wrong As a result with my impulsivity and poor sense of self I developed a personality around him that is extremely hyper immature and is basically his personality but on steroids to cope with how he treats me We are a problematic mix and it s obvious to people but it seems people saw it as fun and games I still don t trust that people will get the wrong idea though especially since I am open about myself because I can never just stfu Him being known to be problematic doesn t stop me from getting paranoid though since he has contacted HR about another coworker who went too far joking around with him This other coworker is toxic as well He is overly blunt and tells people really messed up dark jokes Sometimes they are even directed towards people in a way that is insulting The two of them got into conflict and he went too far so the coworker who often teases others went to HR about it They both got into a bit of trouble I do not see why he wouldn t go to HR about me considering the fact that we tease eachother to death and horse around I also want to mention that there s also a lot of s3x jokes that are spewed out of all of our mouths Sometimes they are directed towards other coworkers and of course you can get in trouble for s3xual harassment this way My stupid impulsive dumbass can t help but to partake in their inappropriate humor Then there is one of the assistant managers Unfortunately I have a stupid crush on him and he s my FP I hate BPD all I do is make a fool out of myself I try to act normal around him but that becomes hard when he too partakes in the teasing and the s3xual jokes with me and the two other coworkers I mentioned What I m mostly concerned about right now is that they all started to target me as the main person to tease and roast and it really hurts especially coming from the assistant manager It s all starting to feel more and more personal especially when he says stuff like you re too short for me if we were a thing people would ask if you re my son and laughing about it He s tall and I m very short and these jokes really sting but I guess I m supposed to just not take them personally since literally him me and the other two coworkers act like a bunch of immature people I really hate it though This isn t me I m LITERALLY just impulsively mirroring them and I don t know how to control myself I want to be myself but I have no idea who tf I am and I have little to no self control and I hate it so much The other day at work I was just casually teasing that one coworker as per usual and I guess I went too far I commented that his breath basically stank and he took offense to that Apparently me saying this was a lot worse than the times he has called me oh I don t know a d ck asshole dumbass serial killer p3do glasses Dahmer stupid degenerate and more along with my work constantly being criticized him insulting my interests and hobbies him trying to find ways to disagree with me on everything laughing at my personal problems and my feelings generally being invalidated As a result he became angsty and sad and started to play his edgy little sappy music through his phone I tried apologizing to deescalate the bullshit and he told me to stop talking for the rest of his shift so I did That was like my last shift with him This upcoming week there is no shift I have with him and it s even to the point where I have no one who can help me We are supposed to have an extra coworker working with us I will be alone on Thursday I remember my first couple weeks working here there was this one coworker who sucked at the job and everyone hated him as a result I d observe how they d treat him They would gossip about him to death when he wasn t around but when he was he was teased A lot He was treated like an equal but it was all fake Nobody liked him He is gone now because he quit So here is my paranoia I am targeted as prey to laugh at for entertainment because I m the mentally unstable homosexual freak who wears all black and has the iconic serial killer glasses so why wouldn t I be a target to bully Everyone hates me They gossip about me tbh this just makes sense since everyone at work gossips so there s no reason I d be excluded from that This coworker is going to go to HR or the higher ups to make complaints about me The assistant manager I like is betraying me and I am being set up for termination I need reassurance that I am being paranoid and irrational or I stg I can t handle this anxiety,Attacking Behavior

for context me and my boyfriend have been on and off for years It has been rocky in the past from both of us we have been together since we were 21 and have both made mistakes and been hurtful to one another We are now older and living together for the first time and for the most part we are in a stable union But sometimes I still feel so I don t know My mental health has never been good I have this diagnoses and the next and have been living with diagnoses medications coping strategies maturing my reactions and honing in my inner turmoil since I was 13 I will be 28 soon I still feel on a day to day life is pretty debilitating and I feel pretty isolated from everyone I am naturally pretty introverted or at least have been as I have gotten older and less trusting but I find that my boyfriend really likes to rely on one another He doesn t like to go to family events my family as we are pretty tight nit we used to have lots of friends together thats how we initially met but that was a big party group and we both lost touch with most of them and now we never hang out with others and he isn t too inclined too I am very anxious around people so I don t push too much I sometimes feel like I live by his schedule and regime He is good to me as I work from home and don t leave often with my anxiety being extra high since the pandemic He listens to me as I often vent about inner turmoil or my emotions fluctuation or I just need to vent day to day he cooks dinner and does lots around the house when I am feeling lower but because of that I feel like I can t say anything to him when he is being short hurtful with his tone or words or when things are bothering me As soon as I am upset and try to communicate with him he goes into the defence mode Over the years we fought a lot but I truly believe that in the last 2 years my communication with most people in my life has improved immensely and I can have really level headed and calm toned listening conversations sometimes I just feel crazy I feel like he mirrors me sometimes my behaviours my traits that I have told him over the years I have to actively work hard to not have constantly needed him to validate if he loves me asking if he hates me all the time wondering if something is wrong with every tone change he never did those things and then all the sudden since moving in he started mirroring those traits and every time I say anything I can be like hey babe can you please take out the garbage and he will get all seri9us and be like do you hate me now and I don t know if it s mocking me or he is now picking up traits it just makes me feel crazy it happens so often even more then I ever did it I sometimes just feel so confused There is times when I will be in the middle of doing something and with my ADHD if I stop a task I have trouble getting back to it and he will want to show me right in that moment and ill ask him nicely to give me a moment I work from home and my hours are wacky and I have expressed that I can t stop working as soon as he gets home but as soon as I am ready to give him my undivided attention which is usually a few seconds later because I feel guilty he will be like nvm you dont care anyways and ill have to beg him and he will usually not show or tell me When I bring up things that upset me he just gets angry walks away or gets defensive so its pointless This is just little bites and pieces of what has been happening recently I feel like I constantly block out parts from the past of our relationship but I just recently feel anxious constantly I thought things were good but with every do you hate me or nvm you dont care anyways I feel like the lack of communication that we always have had that I constantly try to build a bridge to conquer is getting worse and worse He used to do the silent treatment alot ignore me for Hours or days sometimes I just feel like im going crazy,Attacking Behavior
things have been rocky with my fp lately idk if sharing this matters much but we only know each other online though we Äôre really close and have known each other for a year and a half i was having a meltdown today because of the conflict between us and i was texting my fp i was describing how i was crying and said Äúi don Äôt want you to go Äù and they reassured me that they weren Äôt abandoning me i didn Äôt respond to this and they were silent for 40 minutes after that i felt abandoned and unloved because i was hoping they would check in again since i was describing my meltdown i was hoping they could be proactive about caring for me because i have trouble feeling like their care is genuine otherwise i know though that the silent treatment testing is bad communication and it is up to me to communicate my needs i know it can also be manipulative so i texted and said Äúi feel nauseous i can Äôt stop crying i wish you could inquire i Äôm in crisis and everyone Äôs silent Äù they responded Äúyoure coercing me to relieve yourself i cant do this right now Äù i don Äôt have a support network and i was genuinely nauseous crying etc also for context they Äôve been working a lot lately so i understand if they Äôre overwhelmed i really don Äôt want to be manipulative and i have trouble trusting myself to discern if i am or not this is cause when my abandonment trauma is triggered i tend to center myself and struggle to empathize i seek out sympathy i know all of this is very small but it feels really important to me at the moment was i manipulating my fp,Attacking Behavior
Backstory I 33f have been off and on with my boyfriend 33m for roughly four ish years Lots of drama largely from my end as I drank heavily until getting sober 3 months ago He has his demons h as well and we both take kratom We ve been through a lot together The other day I was returning a moving dolly to the shed all his stuff he works construction so lots of tools etc and I noticed a trash bag near the door We recently bought some horrible very thin ones from Lidl that tear with little provocation so I was domestically excited at the prospect of finding a heavy duty one since I have a lot of cleaning to do I opened it to make sure it wasn t full of tools temporary storage and found some coffee cups plastic water bottles and Maybelline concealer The reason this was weird We had gone to the laundromat a few months back I was outside smoking next to his pickup truck when I noticed an unopened Maybelline concealer tube in the truck bed I casually asked him about it and he said the neighbor girl had dropped it We live next door pretty close to a family with a girl in her probably early twenties We re not friends but sometimes say hi I brushed it off and when we came home that evening tossed it into the strip of grass separating our driveway from the neighbors hoping she d see it and pick it up Fast forward to today when I find the makeup in a bag in the shed Why does this make me feel weird Because now the backstory is questionable If she dropped it why would he pick it up to begin with And why would he pick it up AFTER I put it in their yard Another trash bag was next to this one in which I found empty beer bottles covered with grass Also made me feel weird because it was an obvious attempt at making the bag look like yard debris Why would he want to hide that he was drinking beer I don t know of any occasion that he did aside from a few that we found in my moving boxes These were different bottles I really chewed on this for the last four days I didn t want to bring it up at all I didn t know how he would react In the past when I ve found stuff out that he hid stuff that hurt me his response has always been explosive anger I m not perfect and he s not some monster douchebag But this is bothering me I calmly asked him about it super carefully and he got mad took me out to the shed and made a show of yelling about it then locked me out of the house for a couple minutes I didn t raise my voice or get upset at all and basically he just guilted me for ten minutes you don t trust me why are you making something out of nothing etc I just need outside opinions from people who don t know us I ve only told my sister very levelheaded takes his side sometimes when we have fights and she was like damn That looks bad I hate feeling this way like there s gravel in my tummy I m driving myself insane And the way he reacted left me with more questions than answers I fucking hate this,Attacking Behavior
I accidentally made my fp jealous which made him mad It was a genuine accident and i dont know what to do The thing is that once he said its okay if i do the thing i did that made him mad rn bc he doesnt care abt it but when i did it today which he learned abt he got rlly mad and started saying mean stuff Logically i would be understanding qnd explain he forgets q lot of stuff which is okay but he wont listen says mean things and doesn t reply my logical response was to explain what happened and apologize since now i understand why he would be jealous after he explaines he wont even read and keeps telling me to find a new man i know he doesnt mean it and its from a state of anger but i still want him to forgive me i am scared that he will be busy tomorrow since he doesnt know and wont be able to talk to me i had plans today which i guess he wont commit because of what happened but ive really been looking forward for them for such a long time it hurts me i dont k ow what to do i dont want him to sleep before i know he has forgiven me i just wanna do the plans we had so bad yesterday i already had to suck it up because he was too tired he has been really busy and not able to answer me doing what i had in mind and planned out with him would help me feel a lot better but it keeps getting pushed to another day i really love him and i dont know how ro make him understand he isnt the best mentally either not saying hes dangerous rather is unstable and kind of like bpd too i just wanna talk to him normally before he sleeps,Attacking Behavior
I Äôve been in DBT trauma therapy for four years I Äôve previously had two failed startups that I created to fund my production company I attained a 300k investment in three months during a pandemic with my last startup and I haven Äôt had one client in a year with this current startup In my 6 figure startup I was motivated by everyone Äôs expectations of me and my fear of failure I was working from anxiety and having extreme mental breakdowns that my neighbours would complain about 1 3 times a week I would only work sleep and masturbate This lasted 1 year and four months before I had to quit because of a catatonic dissociation I was experiencing in front of clients This current company means more to me so I Äôve been doing my best to not work from a place of anxiety and have done accomplished infinitely less than before I haven Äôt even completed my website I don Äôt maintain the social media I received funding for a short film which I began editing but never completed I have been a full service sex worker since I was 19 and I Äôve used sex work to fund all my businesses I started my 6 figure company so I can stop doing sex work but ended up having to do it anyway And in the same vain with my production company I had to quit sex work after my last company but have found myself still needing to do it to take care of myself Disclaimer If anyone has anything ignorant to say about sex work say it to yourself because I WILL curse you out and hurt your feelings This is not the place I Äôve also lost a lot of friends after quitting sex work due to the transactional relationships I had that didn Äôt benefit me It Äôs always been hard for me to leave the house since I was very very young I rarely do activities I enjoy and my money though I have poor management of it only ever goes towards food transportation rent and bills Now you can tell me I need to set lower expectations and I need to take care of myself or cultivate a life worth living while taking reasonable steps towards my goals and celebrating my wins and find more patience but that won Äôt make a difference Any step I take towards these lofty ideals has been unsustainable The best I Äôve been able to accomplish is a dissociation from the pain of my reality through fantasising sleeping weed and distracting myself with people I Äôve tried so many things that I Äôm completely exhausted but life doesn Äôt give a fuck if you Äôre tired or not and my responsibilities are there whether I have the strength to face them or not So is my loneliness and disappointment I Äôm too overwhelmed to make baby steps and when I do I can Äôt sustain them I Äôll be able to do things for a week maybe two and fall of for 1 3 months thereafter I hate my current circumstances in life money home career relationships body every aspect of my life too much to have the patience it takes to improve them drastically enough to feel better about my life TLDR read the title,Attacking Behavior

I appreciate anyone reading this But it Äôs more of a vent I just needed to get off my chest My mood flip from manic to depressed happened amazingly in a 24 hour period I met someone amazing and spent several hours on the phone with her laughing and smiling my face off last night Today I got my routine STD tests back all clear Except something out of the ordinary in the urinalysis Apparently a potential cancer or kidney failure sign I Äôve been having some ED issues lately but nothing that should be problematic there THAT bad So I have to go in for follow ups for that Then started in the hailstorm of the fact I had plans with another girl for New Years So I was trying to figure out what to do and that blew things up with both of them because my dumb ass was honest about it with both of them The girl for New Years wasn Äôt an exclusive thing Ä and we hadn Äôt even met yet So now they Äôre both not speaking to me I might have some early cancer signs and then my mother calls to ask to borrow cash and yeh this day has just gone to hell and I Äôve crashed hard moodwise To make matters more fun all of this was after reading my therapists notes about my BPD and depression so I can Äôt tell which started first the drop or the crap I can Äôt tell sometimes if the mood causes these things or where I ended up here But I Äôm headed for the whiskey bottle now,Emotional Distress
2 weeks ago my bf of 5 months broke up with me because he felt I was leaning on him too much emotionally and didn t have enough trust that he actually loved me cared about me Long story short the relationship was super intense at first It was an instant almost soul connection We spent like every day together for a month he told me he loved me after 3 weeks etc I can t remember the moment things started going south but I started to get more insecure in the relationship We would have a great night together then I d wake up the next morning and feel irritable anxious vent a lot then feel like I was pushing him away by being too much this has been a common thing in the past for me in relationships He would always say it was fine but then later he would be a bit withdrawn and would often say things like I m just spent from our conversations earlier I m drained etc so it became harder for me to know when he was actually fine or when he was just saying that As it progressed I needed more reassurance from him we would get in an argument usually from me thinking things were wrong him getting annoyed and withdrawing then I would need a ton of reassurance that he wasn t breaking up with me Conflict has always been really triggering for me as I ve had partners walk out at the first sign of conflict He always said I m here I m here you just need to believe it well figure it out we ll make it work I love you Then literally the day after one of these instances where he reassured me that hes not going anywhere he broke up with me said that we ve tried everything its just the same pattern not working I understand how emotionally draining constant reassurance can be and I ve been trying my best to see it from his perspective It just makes me worry about future relationships if this guy was so in it but then just walked out how am I ever going to believe someone else in the future It s also upsetting because this relationship I was a lot better than ones in my past I had a couple of slip ups but I never did anything like accusing him of cheating cheating myself name calling stonewalling etc etc If he couldn t even handle that how is anyone going to Needed to get all this off my chest any support advice would be greatly appreciated lt 3,Emotional Distress

In a long string of complicated events my boyfriend has lived with me and my family for the past year The agreement between him and my mother was that he eventually would find another place to live as soon as he could This is fine in concept my household is extremely toxic and a big reason for my BPD so it s a good thing that my boyfriend finds a place to escape the crazy However now that that time has come I feel like I m going crazy over it I don t want him to leave I would move with him but the place he s moving to is 45 minutes to an hour away depending on traffic which would make my work commute hell I used to have a 1hr 30min 2 hour commute awhile ago and I just don t want to go through that again I m also not in a place where I feel OK to move out seeing as I don t think I could handle the situation it would cause with my parents another long story basically my mother has bpd as well and I m her FP I can t do anything without her flipping out I feel like he s abandoning me even though we all agreed he would eventually find his own place We re not breaking up but it feels like we are since I ve become so accustomed to having him around all the time It also feels like he s happy to not only get away from my family but from me as well The way I found out was also rough too I knew his friend needed a roommate and that it was quite possible he would end up moving but he told me he d let me know as soon as he found out Next thing I know Christmas eve haven t heard anything and he tells my parents out of the blue Oh by the way I ll be moving out in the beginning of January I was so taken off guard and hurt that he hadn t even bothered to tell me beforehand I feel like he has secretly hated me this whole time and has kept it under wraps until now Today and tomorrow are his days off I have tomorrow off as well and we were supposed to spend the day together Instead I get a text from him while at work that he s going in to work on his two days off He hates working And I don Äôt mean in the normal way he has quit and lost so many jobs even in this year it s his one big flaw He isn t even staying with this job as it was a temp position I can t help but feel like he s taking extra shifts to avoid me now I m splitting on him and hard I want to crawl into a hole and cry But at the same time I feel ridiculous for feeling this way I hate my BPD and wish I could just handle situations normally I m sorry that this post is so long and I know that it probably doesn t make a lot of sense my life is really weird and complicated so it s hard to explain I just wanted to get my thoughts out before they consumed me even more than they already have Thanks for reading if you have gotten this far,Emotional Distress
Im trying not to see this as malice or just a lack of caring but we have been close for maybe 6 months Look I know in the grand scheme of things 6 months isnt a lot but i feel like someone who has BPD should know the impact it would have we would be so understanding if they told us that they are overwhelmed with the group but i feel like they just sneaked out and didnt explain why im trying radical acceptance and self soothe there is always the thought that it was because of me that they left i know that its not likely at all but the worry comes in that maybe there is a fatal character flaw that i am unaware of that drives people away but i wish them all the best,Emotional Distress

not that it s some sort of scandalous thing I have intense CPTSD and ADHD and have suspected that I might have BPD for about 4 years but the type where I just split on myself after having a really rough breakup with another in April of this year they still check in on me and I fall for it because I still have compassion for her and depression both overtook us She was able to do the same things I wante id with someone else but made feel preposterous for asking it s complex but it s best that it s not romantic I took it upon myself to be really single and not rely on anyone because I was afraid of just being hurt again So I just met people at parties and functions trying to revive and resuscitate what little hope I had for new people One night I met this really sweet girl and her friend and she was very charming and funny and witty and She is frankly a firecracker but during the summer I was absolutely determined not to develop feelings for her and I came off a bit jokingly dismissive and said I d be her secretary she is the exact opposite of my ex and is so relatable in the way she advertises healing and neurodivergencies and her struggles and it s a breathe of fresh air my good friend at the time noticed that and was like yeah uh huh so essentially a couple months later I was at this party she invited me too and I became so wasted because I saw her in her outfit and i gaypanicked so hard I thought I was a freshman again It was then I realized that I liked her but for some reason like my brain is like don t Don t Like Her Don t hurt her I had asked her to a movie but due to health problems I had to basically walk it back Like I ll try to justify this and then we ll talk and then she ll say something that just makes me feel like I can be insane in her presence but due to my CPTSD I m still so guarded I don t feel like I m on her level at all though I m way more introverted I also just got back into therapy and I want to work on myself and she seems so nice And also at that same party I had this very weird sexual pull thing towards someone she may be good friends with and I feel like shame about that too That friend and I don t talk at all though I guess all I m asking is that are their things that I should keep in mind with someone who has BPD From basically the moment I met her I think knowing her diagnosis hasn t turned me off from being her friend or anything but it does make me want to be careful and not hurt her,Emotional Distress
I had the terrible combo of abusive household bulling in school combo for 18 years I ve been struggling all my life and felt like everything was rigged against me I don t remember large portions of my child or teen years because of the intense disassociation Now I am trying to heal I went to therapy but now I m mostly on my own since I don t have enough money for more therapy I realized that my fragile mind made me feel triggered in almost any aspect of my life I was in a constant fight response with everyone I was abusive myself in past relationships friends partner Even though it was a trauma response it was not a excuse I am stuck with waves of shame that swallow me whole every time I remember anything I said I wasn t the best to my current partner some years ago I said things I really regret I apologized and he forgave me I am trying as hard as I can to not fall into old ways and I want to think I am doing great I talked to him and he agrees that I am way better now but I know he resents me sometimes and I know that there is nothing I can do about it Part of me feels like I deserve this resentment I know I wasn t the best person but I just want to have another chance Every time I remember something or I see anything on media remotely similar to what I said it s like I m paralyzed with a bunch of stupid thoughts that usually scalate very quickly I can t afford therapy right now but I want to not cry for days and obsess over how much of a bad person I am to the point of start disassociating and having scary thoughts again I know this is not therapy and not a place to ask for medical advice but can you point me to some books podcasts or anything that can help me,Emotional Distress
Context I had a one sided falling out with a friend group some time ago and it was mostly me distancing myself because whenever with them I would become overwhelmed with a lot of anger and jealousy Tried to rationalize my anger best I could when by myself but ended up feeling lots of guilt and shame I was also just paranoid about them leaving me so I unconsciously tried leaving them first Told them about BPD and some things I go through seemed pretty understanding but nothing changed Haven Äôt spoken to anyone in weeks Some weeks ago my friend 20F confessed she liked me 20F romantically I liked her too Before everything went down we grew close and comfortable with each other And it Äôs the first time someone has openly reciprocated their feelings towards me It seemed like she wanted to start a romantic relationship with me because she told me she Äôd Äúwait for me Äù I told her about how I wanted to work on getting better before going into any relationship or at least learn to manage my friendships before anything else She told me I could tell her to stop waiting if I ever felt overwhelmed After our initial confessions we kept close contact for like a week We lived in the same city but a lot of things happened to her at home so she left for awhile I sent her messages asking her how she was hoping she was doing well when she went days without responding to me So we hadn Äôt been in the same city in a while We made plans prior to meet up and hang out but with everything that happened I understood it Äôd be awhile before we see each other again When she confessed she told me she hoped she could be there for me when times were hard So I tried really hard to be open with her about good and bad things But when we texted it was pretty one sided I Äôd excitedly tell her about something and she Äôd responding repeating what I said essentially She never spoke about herself when I asked about her only giving vague answers It started feeling like she was responding to me out of obligation often times apologizing if her not responding Äúmade me think Äù her words And it did but in the end I always understood she was busy with many things so I didn Äôt feel any anger or thought about it too much but her unwarranted apology did make me a bit irritated because it felt like she really was just responding to me out of obligation And recently after like a month of not seeing her she came back to the city we live in She hasn Äôt told me directly that she came back but we share each other Äôs location It Äôs been a week and I haven Äôt seen her We Äôve texted once this week I had a feeling she had a reason for not telling me like maybe she wanted space after everything that happened at home And I know she has her own priorities But last night I saw that one of our other friends stayed over at her place and this morning I saw that they went out together I know she isn Äôt obligated to tell me anything but still I think it would have been nice for her to at least tell me she was back Last night I texted her she could stop Äúwaiting for me Äù I thought about this for awhile but a part of me wanted to be hopeful but I think seeing them together last night just pushed me over the edge And we haven t revisited this conversation in a long time Ultimately I didn Äôt feel important to her or at least as important as our other friends I couldn Äôt understand why she didn Äôt at least tell me she was back I won Äôt deny I have faults in this I should have communicated my feelings properly but she once told me she liked me because she felt I didn Äôt expect anything from her like everyone else I guess that always stopped me from saying anything because I didn t want her to feel pressured to act a certain way But I always initiated everything Äîplans heartfelt conversations Äîif she had just told me she was back I would have reminded her about our plans to hang out Because of all of this I doubt she has any feelings left for me I don t think I m important to her I don t really know how to go on from here I told her it would be great if we can still be friends but I don t know how to even face her after all of this tldr had falling out with friend group one friend 20F confessed to me 20F I liked them too Talked for awhile her responses became less infrequent due to family issues I understood all of this and was never angry with her or anything We lived in the same city but she left home to deal with family issues She came back recently and didn t tell me but hangs out with other friends despite our prior plans Made me pretty annoyed despite trying to understand So I told her we can stop hoping for anything more than a friendship Now questioning if she even liked me or if I was even important to her,Emotional Distress

So quick synopsis of my experience so far i asked my gp to have a look at referring me to mental health specialists because of struggling with traits consistent with bpd gp agreed very much not depression and needs a referral for diagnosis to bpd received a letter saying i am too young to be diagnosed with bpd i am 20F This brings us to today i am pregnant with my first child and my mental health has never been worse i get referred to perinatal mental health specialists so i mention this bpd referral and the traits i Äôve struggled with for years she says that while she can Äôt diagnose me herself her team can and it seems likely BUT she goes on to say bpd isnt called bpd in the uk its under the name emotional disregulation disorder etc i have never heard of this and truthfully it sounds a little bit like she is trying to fob me off she says its exactly the same but that the term borderline personality disorder is american and not used in the uk however the nhs literally have a page discussing it titled borderline personality disorder and at no point does it mention this change of title has anyone heard of this it doesnt even seem close to bpd especially as most of every mental illness has emotional disregulation,Emotional Distress
I have been stressed and amped up a lot going on Finishing up my last semester for my associates Also summer is always stressful because of my Section 8 renewal I believe I mentioned this in a previous post This last month was my sister s birthday and my other sister had several soft ball games I guess I don t well with being there for other people particularly my family I show up it s done I m ready to go home Any way lately I ve been isolating because I ve been feeling overwhelmed and resentful towards everyone in my life A lot of that is just my own personal shit and I am aware of that My mother and I had a conversation on the phone and I tried to explain how I ve been feeling angry and mean was the way I put it and I needed to be left alone for a bit She totally flipped it on me Not in a bad way but in one of those ways where I felt like I completely fucked up Why can t I just be angry Or tired Or just not be okay Anyway if anyone has anything they would like to say feel free to weigh in Me personally I just feel like to be alone for a little bit Let me do my own thing and not feel bad for it Just a stray thought Everyone preaches about self care but the moment I try to take it I feel like I get slapped on the wrist Guess I am just not a family person,Emotional Distress
I was in a 6 year relationship with someone and broke up with them a few months ago At the beginning of our relationship I was 18 years old and my BPD was off the charts I would get extremely jealous anxious and all that lovely stuff almost every single day It was exhausting But the more that time went on we drifted apart and we were more like best friends by the end of it When we broke up I hadn Äôt had any intense BPD jealous feelings etc for a long time and I genuinely thought I was past feeling that way I was wrong Fast forward to now I am in a wonderful relationship They tell me every day how much they love me and reassure me that everything is okay They have BPD too However the BPD thoughts have never been so intense I have definitely never loved anyone this much and I hope I marry this person I can Äôt go a single day without having the most gut wrenching anxiety that they Äôre going to leave me I misread their tone of voice all the time and assume that they Äôre upset with me when they Äôre not They text me little details of their day like Äúoh I was just talking to a customer Äù and I Äôll genuinely sit and sob over it because I think they Äôre gonna fall in love with someone else It Äôs hell And I am very aware that this is not normal and that it is toxic I just cannot shake these awful thoughts and feelings away no matter how hard I try to They couldn Äôt be more reassuring if they tried How do I help manage this Therapy is not an option for me at the moment unfortunately so I thought I Äôd reach out to see if you guys have any tips as I Äôm terrified of ruining this,Emotional Distress
After a lot of research I Äôm looking to seek out a bpd diagnosis Unfortunately a lot of the info I Äôm finding online is very American centric when it comes to diagnosis I know a lot of ppl in the uk get diagnoses after a crisis or stay in a psych ward This isn Äôt really the case for me yeah I am really not doing well right now but I wouldn Äôt say I Äôm in active crisis I Äôve done an e consult with my gp and should hear back from them Monday or Tuesday but I Äôm interested to hear what peoples stories and experiences are and how the process was Thank you in advance üòä,Emotional Distress
I know it Äôs common for people to say those of us diagnosed w bpd are attention seeking Fair in my individual experience of the disorder But to be told they Äôre behaving inappropriately in a psych hospital because they want to be breast fed This seems so weird to me and it Äôs been hard for me to shake even though it Äôs been 6 months since I last saw one of the people who was saying this about to me I just want to know why it would Äôve even been said to me at all Possible reasons Because I calm down in physical holds I never asked to have my head wrestled onto anyone Äôs chest Because I am a younger passive woman I don Äôt feel like there Äôs too many people outside my specific demographic they would Äôve felt this appropriate to say about to Because they can Äôt figure out another reason for why I Äôm running away and screaming and headbanging I can Äôt figure it out either thx but it Äôs definitely not because I want to suck on a strangers breast And then the time where someone was directly saying this to me while I was in a hold I didn Äôt do anything to purposely try to get attention or make any situation like that happen But there I was On some woman Äôs chest who was telling me I wanted her Äúliteral nipple Äù when I 100 did not I just I just would like to understand if this has happened to anyone else bc I Äôm really embarrassed and confused and humiliated and feeling disgusting I think about it a lot and it doesn Äôt seem right or normal idk,Emotional Distress

It feels like the whole world is imploding on me right now and I have so much anger I don t know what to do with it My ex friend we stopped being friends a few days ago cut me off because her controlling and manipulative boyfriend had her cut off me and 4 other people within one night She has been posting on twitter about all the people that were cut off horrible insulting things Revealing my PERSONAL life and struggles I didn t even know this was going on until a mutual friend sent a screenshot of a very specific post that could only be directed towards me Her and I were previously very close and the last 2 months of our friendship were a bit stagnant as I became severely depressed and was hospitalized for it for a week She was one of the only people I felt like I could trust at the time and I let her know multiple times that my mental health wasn t good and I apologized for not hanging out with her as much etc However she became distant in return and I honestly kind of felt like she was developing a resentment towards me I just dismissed it as a normal BPD overthinking thing but I guess I was right She claims I was a bad friend and that I blamed my mental health for it I always try to take a step back and see the other side of things before getting riled up but she is the ONLY friend who reacted to my depression in that way Everyone else was very supportive and understanding I feel like i m being driven insane by the obsessive posts and my brain convincing me that I was in the wrong and I really was a bad friend I feel some sympathy towards her because I know the emotional abuse she s probably enduring from the relationship she s in is horrible I am just emotionally in a very fragile state right now and the emptiness I felt for so long is starting to turn into anger,Emotional Distress

I really can t deal with the stigma I genuinely asked my therapist why from all the mental illnesses she had to diagnose me with one of the most stigmatized and demonized ones haha Sounds silly but from now on since I ve been officially diagnosed for quite a while now I feel like I m always gonna have to lie to my family friends at work Because I just can t deal with it I already see that people who know are scared of me cutting off contact and just don t want anything to do with me For some people even those mental health aware ones everything I say or do is BPD related Like there s nothing else outside of my disorder I already feel like a less of a person because of it and more stigma that would come from people knowing about my BPD bipolar and bulimia sounds like way too much I know I can t handle it I just want to be equal to everyone around but no matter what I do and how hard I try all my emotions and feelings are invalid because I m insane I feel I have to lie and always gonna have to till the day I die I feel like not admitting to my mental illnesses is only going to benefit me because people are going to treat me equally and respect my emotions or at least not invalidate them just because they re less ill than me I hope it all makes sense If not I ll just delete it don t want to make mess,Emotional Distress
Anyone here struggle with their unstable sense of self or identity thanks to BPD but only made worse due to being part of a minority group I grew up in an Indian Muslim household so our personalities lifestyles and psyches were far more collectivist about group harmony authority deference inter connectedness and interpersonal relationships than those for societies in the West like the US and Canada My therapist and I have talked a bit on how this sheer inconvenience with the individualistic ways of thinking acting and behaving in the West has caused so many of the issues of borderline personality disorder Issues of shame guilt sense of self and well being identity as defined by things that are interpersonal or independent from one Äôs actual self and general values from many Asian cultures can just be difficult Some research has shown this is true in confidence between individualistic collectivist personalities being at the basis of mental health issues I can post sources links if people are interested,Emotional Distress
I have a trouble explaining my feelings to others but I Äôll try to bring it up somehow and talk about it a lot of the times people don Äôt even understand why I Äôm hurted or not validate me in the way I expected Sometimes they even make it look like it was not a big deal and I Äôm petty for even getting upset whatever i can Äôt force them to genuinely feel sorry like I want and expect But then I notice that the days keep going on and I Äôm still mad I don Äôt want to be but I keep feeling this rage and trying my best to not lashing out at them and not being rude but their presence starts annoying me I don Äôt want to hear them I Äôm losing empathy for them Can anyone relates and know what you can do in situations like that Because if I Äôm bring it up again then I Äôm Äò Äôtrying to make a drama Äô Äô and Äò Äôstuck in the past Äô Äô but I physically can Äôt move on from the hurt and forgive if I don Äôt get the validation I don Äôt even get the recognition,Emotional Distress

None of this sounds good or feels good to write but I ve been thinking about how I ve maybe always used people rather than having two way genuine relationships I feel like I have lacked awareness and understanding of the give and take of relationships Basic empathy In relationships I think I expected and wanted my partner to fill the void I feel without really seeing them and appreciating them as a separate person I expected them to be my everything and then broke down whenever they eventually failed to fill that roll With friendships I never reached out to hang out I only spent time with them if they asked and I felt in the mood I was rarely that curious to how my friends thought about things or how they were doing As soon as I got into a relationship I d drop all my friends because I felt like my needs were better met by my boyfriend I have a new friend now who I enjoy spending time with but we have several mismatches in values They are my only friend so I m excited about not having to be friendless anymore It s nice to have someone to text and hang out with Yet I think to myself that I don t really like him that much and if I had better friends I had more in common with I would just drop this friend I feel like I m just using him to fulfill my needs Does this make sense to anyone else here,Emotional Distress

I need help from others with BPD on how to go forward in this situation Ive been in treatment for the past three years but currently dont recieve any therapy for my diagnosis since i cant afford to I really need and would appreciate someone with experience to help me since i cant get any advice from my therapist right now Today i had a heated discussion with my sister and her boyfriend This is the first time Ive ever disagreed so much with someone in a discussion and actually not ended up raging and crying at them I was feeling ALL the feelings But kept my cool and in my opinion was really good at not escalating I had some slip ups but took back what I said immediately rephrased and apologized It ended up being cool but now I Äôm sitting alone in my room completely BURSTING with anger All of the things they said replay in my mind over and over All of the things I wanted to scream at them is going off in my head like a loud ass never ending firealarm I feel like I can Äôt mask it so I Äôll have to isolate until I Äôve calmed down or something Please help Right now I Äôm feeling really offended by the way it went down Her bf cut me off several times and laughed at some of my arguments These are both huge triggers for me But I kept it inside The themes discussed were transphobia and the patriarchy I didn Äôt start the discussion I just replied to a myth that was stated to correct it I Äôm really sensitive about the subject as I have a lot of loved ones who are trans or identify outside of the binary So it sits very close to my heart which they know The discussion wasn Äôt too long but long enough to the point that I wanted to leave several times I ended up not leaving because I didn Äôt want to escalate by being Äúdramatic Äù Now I Äôm sat in my room full of rage and feelings of inequality At some point her bf asked me for literal SOURCES on my arguments That pissed me of He didn Äôt ask for them when my boyfriend was speaking In the end we all agreed to disagree and went on our ways They seemed normal I acted calm I Äôm kind of happy I didn Äôt rage at them I don Äôt want to drive my sister away At the same time I Äôm SO MAD I didn Äôt just rage It Äôs so contradicting and it Äôs driving me mad On one hand I know I would have felt worse if I ended up screaming and making my sister cry or something but at the same time I feel like it Äôs so unfair that I can Äôt do that because that Äôs how I feel Why does he get to peck at me during the argument and I have to shut up about it Why does it feel so unfair And how the hell do I go forward We live in the same house so I Äôll have to engage with them I feel like I Äôm gonna burst Please help Do I talk to him or my sister privately Do I set down boundaries And what would those be I Äôm so confused as to what is supposed to happen now Like I said I Äôve never had such a heated discussion without it ending in screams and crying before The only feelings I Äôm having now is anger and indignation I Äôm open to any advice and please tell me if I Äôm being unfair here Wtf please help I don Äôt know what else to say,Emotional Distress
half a year ago I ended a really unhealthy codependent relationship where my ex was I think a Äùfavorite person Äù My whole life was dependent on him and I gave up everything to simply be with him I even gave up my values I feel like And now looking back at the relationship I dont even know if it was even real love I ever felt Just like 3 months after we broke up I met this other guy online and we really connected like in a very different way from my ex It felt more natural like we already knew eachother like we have the same values and humour and goals and so forth Ä but I dont see him as a Äùfavorite person Äù My life is not dependent on him and even if I want him to always be there I dont feel like I Äùneed him to be Äù if that makes sense Yet that also makes me doubt my feelings I always believed love was more like my last relationship so its kind of confusing I feel I cant trust myself and what Im feeling Its like im weirded out and uncomfortable by healthy relationships And also this guy showing interest in me giving me all these nice compliments I almost feel like he is the one idealizing me and not the other way around and that also makes me feel uncomforable in a way Like how can someone even be interested in me,Emotional Distress
I want to go back to therapy I want to be totally honest After some self reflection and being in denial about my diagnosis I chalked up my symptoms to anxiety and depression as well as the PTSD and was comparing myself to extreme presentations of BPD I want to explain here so as to not trigger or make anyone feel demonized I was once friends with another pwBPD that wasn t in treatment like I was claiming as I have that the meds didn t work they made me feel worse made us zombies etc the general disillusionment when receiving treatment I guess I wasn t getting better but I was trying to be more open but just like them I was bitter and felt like I was just being placated and treated like a child They did some extreme things for example defacing someone else s property when they felt like their FP was taking care of someone else I understand what they felt but it scared me I didn t act out that way but I acted out in other ways no judgment But now after examining myself How I could empathize with the desire to hurt them back I am no longer in denial but I am afraid of myself and have been for years Afraid of what I might do if something hurts me bad enough Does anyone else share this fear And I m afraid to open up to a therapist I realize I ve blamed others for years for my mental health Not my family I m with now but I blamed my mother my foster mother and after a series of limerence issues and feeling like I needed a backup plan after coming out to my husband not wanting to be honest about who I was because I was afraid he d abandon us because I heard him distinctly say things that led me to believe he wouldn t accept me üòî I m not the victim here I ve struggled to keep my irritability in check and not seep how I feel about things into my family I worry that I am a narcissist I retreated from everyone emotionally pushed them away got to where all I wanted to do was smoke pot and stay home and treated everything else like an inconvenience and I m extremely ashamed and feel so guilty about it all And remorse I wish I could go back in time and change it despite knowing I can t change the past I m crumbling underneath the weight of it I try to hold it together and do what I need to do but when I m alone I spend the majority of my time trying to shut up the thoughts in my head I forget to do things sometimes like last night I went out into the kitchen to get my dog his food and my husband asked me to grab him a towel because I had forgotten to replace it after doing laundry I felt so shitty that I had forgotten something so important so quickly I used to be so frustrated that I d snap at others I ve silenced myself and suppressed it all lately and now I m in this place where all I feel is negative When my husband touches me all I can think about is how I have failed to support him in the past I m afraid I can t change That I don t feel love That i have no empathy And I cannot stop it I have tried so hard and it feels like nothing is working When insurance kicks in I m planning to not let myself give up on therapy Starting out fresh with a new therapist everything on the table My triggers the rage when I was a teenager I fought with my foster mom and was extremely defensive and so scared all the time I wouldn t be treated the same as the blood daughters but I got over it over time I am terrified that my therapist will look at me and say I m a hopeless case even though I desperately want to make sure both that I heal and can have decent relationships stop the splitting I m struggling to keep hope alive but I m struggling and say at least I m fighting it I have an amazing support system and worry so much about inflicting the unintentional narcissistic abuse I endured as a result of a narcissistic faith system I even made sure I got confirmation from five other ex cult folks who have had to go through the same process but didn t have as many mental issues as I do for perspective because I know mine is not to be trusted I just hug my teddy bear and try to ride it out but also work in the mornings so as not to neglect my responsibilities I struggle with driving and staying focused and feeling like I m just doing all this stuff for my family out of guilt and ill snap back into my old habits once I get overwhelmed again though i feel overwhelmed at everything I journal I haven t been meditating because it feels like even when I try to focus on that my thoughts still pierce through you re faking this you re not really trying to recover you re just trying not to be alone you re a piece of shit user and that s all you ll ever be and I don t want that to be true but my memories they assault me daily I want to go through my memories with my therapist But I m scared I m terrified I ve told my brother about all this stuff but can t help feeling like he s trying to make me feel better I know he wouldn t lie to me But I feel like I ve made them walk on eggshells around me I dont want that for us my brothers and I got separated and I just got them back a few years ago My worries about everything caused me to be controlling micromanaging I ve tried to be mindful of those triggers and I m working on it But if anyone has some insight some advice anything I ve written these same worries my memories everything down in my journal when I can t get them to stop Can anyone please just anything,Emotional Distress
Good morning everyone I ll just jump straight in I currently have diagnoses for major depressive disorder generalized anxiety disorder and ADHD I do not suspect I have BPD but I have and still do struggle with the favourite person symptom for lack of a better term I was wondering if there were any other disorders that featured a similar symptom or if perhaps my current diagnoses could explain why I have this seemingly BPD unique struggle I understand that you re not mental health professionals I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions for possible aspects I could start focusing on and taking note of for when I m able to meet with my own mental health team again Thank you,Emotional Distress
maybe my diagnosis was wrong and I actually have narcissism as a teenager i always wondered if i did yesterday my bf implied i night after trying to explain how i feel most of the time i told him most times i feel nothing buy when i do feel things i feel everything and he told me Äúit seems like you feel intense all the time maybe you Äôre a narcissist Äù i think he Äôs right i don Äôt want to generalize all people with npd but i really don Äôt want to be the same way i don Äôt want to be an evil manipulative person i don Äôt want to continuously hurt my loved ones i don Äôt want to be like my father or any of my other abusers at the end of the day i Äôm the common denominator in all my toxic abusive relationships so maybe i am the narcissist,Emotional Distress

I know this is a place to vent and not for advice but I don t know where to go A friend of mine is diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder much like myself and she went through some things a while back that are not making sense to her anymore She s been really worked up about the situation and I asked her if I can post about this to reddit in hopes of finding more informed and unbiased judgements This is her description of what happened to her I will try to clarify some parts that may be erratic and not make sense to you I was admitted to the hospital in December and the psychiatrists were not very nice to me the female psych would scold me for forgetting to write a journal but I trusted them they diagnosed me with BPD and once they told me that they are performing a shock therapy on me and I was like alright they put things on my hand and asked me things which I don t remember cause I too much medicated after leaving the hospital I went for a follow up once and it was my last follow up because they told my father everything that I told them it was just related to my family it was nothing like revealing my plan to harm myself or others I was crying and shaking my head for them to stop but they did not I didn t understand things back then but yesterday I came to know after random discussion with my professor that it could be a lie detecting test I checked the pictures of lie detecting test on the internet and they seemed similar to the one they used on me So for one your therapist shouldn t be scolding you that kinda defeats the entire purpose The second issue I see here is to my understanding shock therapy works by passing a mild current through your brain so they attach the thingies to your scalp I have never been through it so I may be wrong But they did it through her hands Which she was told later could be a lie detector test AND they revealed what she said during therapy to her parents which wasn t related to suicide or self harm Can they perform these procedures without full disclosure and consent from the patient,Emotional Distress

Hey y Äôall can Äôt sleep originally it was because of something else but now it Äôs because of Ä well the title Long story short Said favorite person let Äôs call them XYZ didn Äôt confront me about a breakdown I had over a fear of losing them platonically mind you last april because they got a boyfriend and thought i Äôd be abandoned or forgotten Gonna be honest not my proudest moment I still cringe thinking about that pre diagnosed breakdown and it didn Äôt help that that was when things got worse and felt like I was on eggshells because of it and being afraid to lose them over it But at the time They acted like it was fine and so I assumed things were fine right That was until this march when they confronted me about my behavior how clingy and draining I am etc They waited eleven months to tell me this AND on the week that I got officially diagnosed which hurt even more I shouldn Äôt let it hurt because they were right I have them blocked and muted for my mental health didn Äôt want to do it but it got to the point where I had to hold myself back and use my techniques i Äôve learnt to not lash out At times I feel like I Äôm at peace but then other times I break down and start hating myself for not catching things on sooner to save the friendship and then to hating them for not doing this sooner I switch between missing them and hating them and it got to the point where last quarter on campus every time I saw them I just Ä got this urge to run away and hide Like seeing them immediately activated my fight or flight Not in a Äòah jeez here comes this guy Äô way in a Äòthey can Äôt see me if they do things will become WORSE and i Äôll lose control or break down or they Äôll laugh at me or Äô way Do y Äôall get any thoughts about losing loved ones from BPD diagnosed or undiagnosed at the time Is there any way to help move on It Äôs not like I think about them every day but it Äôs moreso like any thought of the event or if them comes in and I immediately want to block it out of my head It won Äôt help they Äôre sharing a course with me next quarter once i Äôm on campus I Äôm just gonna be mature and act like they Äôre only another student like I am but I know internally I Äôm gonna act up and have to hold back,Emotional Distress
Hello everyone Identity disturbance is a relatively understudied part of BPD in the academic literature but after reading up on it I think I Äôm realising how much it plays into my life rapidly changing obsessions career goals and self image I wanted to know how this part of BPD affects others and if anyone Äôs found helpful ways to cope with it or to build a more stable sense of self,Emotional Distress
Hey so I recently got dumped by someone with bpd but I really really loved this person because they reminded me so much of myself but I think it was because maybe the mirroring or something I can Äôt tell anymore but they seemed like my ÄúTwin Flame Äù but it hurts more because the way they left was they suddenly didn Äôt answer calls etc they just vanished blocked me and I Äôm not about to go to someone Äôs house to harass them Ä but does anyone with bpd know that they mirror or is it just NPD I feel confused about this because I tend to copy people unconsciously I mean like REALLYY copy people and when I realized I feel embarrassed etc I try so hard not to let it show that when this person did it I couldn Äôt understand if it was me who copied them or them who mirrored me I hope it not just blaming their disorder if so you guys can shit on me for it I Äôm so sorry it might just be this person just wondering Ä,Emotional Distress
Background we have been friends for over 10 years and began a romantic relationship 6 months ago We live 2 hrs apart and until recently have been making the long distance work with equal travel to see each other on weekends and holidays In the last couple months I have been the one to travel to see him he ignores my phone calls and texts and says that his emotional impermanence when I m not around he doesn t believe I love him I think and anxiety around making plans I want to find a way to make this work but I m struggling I have done loads of research into supporting someone with BPD But I suffered a significant bereavement recently and am in uni I normally have empathy and patience coming out of my ears but I m burning out I wrote him this letter to start a conversation about this How does it sound Is it fair Am I being reasonable Any feedback would be amazing Thank you Äî Äî As you shared with me last week I am finding that our relationship is taking a serious toll on my mental health I find it really hard to cope with the inconsistent communication the lack of commitment to plans and the fear that I cannot talk freely about my thoughts and feelings without causing you emotional distress that leads to a switch or a dissociative episode I love you very much but I am not receiving the type of love I need in return I need to feel as though my partner wants to speak with me isn t stressed out about making plans with me and that I am a priority in their life Further I need to feel as though I can support my partner through their own struggles rather than burden them and burn myself out in the process With things as they currently stand I am not in a place where I can do this for you I want you to trust me to help you through your hardships as I want to trust that you ll continue to help me through mine I love you and I will never ever abandon you I don t know what I can do to help you remember this when you re feeling down I understand and accept that BPD cannot be cured and that it makes all of this stuff incredibly difficult But managing the symptoms it is by no means impossible You are a strong capable amazing person and I know that you can do anything You have been such an incredible caring and supportive person in my life You always know make me laugh even on my darkest days If we could develop a way to move forward together baggage and all I would be delighted to continue our romantic involvement I can imagine such a bright and loving future for us together To get there I believe that we must both agree to develop strategies to do this individually and as a team But I need you to communicate with me and help me figure this out I do not have the resiliency to do this alone If this is not possible then we should end our romantic relationship and return to being friends,Emotional Distress
Is this wrong of me to do so cause gawd damn I tried and kept trying as she did I told her every day I love her but when it comes down from someone in the past it haunts and kills the both of us I want her to be happy even if it Äôs not with me I know I haven Äôt been able to please her sexual and emotional cause of my BPD I question my self and her feelings in which I think for one and feel for the other There is too much to unload here but I never imagine my girlfriend lied straight to my face and said there Äôs nothing or hasn Äôt been any kind of relations or relationship when they have been together and she still tells me it Äôs plutonic She did have and relationship with this guy I never met him or try to met him until yesterday and she was freaking out about that cause her uncle was there,Emotional Distress
Is it normal to lose the ability to feel emotions in your body Before i used to have really strong and intense physical responses to my emotions and i would Feel them deeply Now i dont Feel anything in my body Not even the warmth of contentment and relaxation Only stuck in nothing This has happened over the last few weeks I can cry but I dont feel any emotion in my body when I do My chest does not tighten and I cant feel the sadness and despair like that My chest just feels empty and hollow I try to feel but it still just empty in my body I also dont feel touch like before I am not numb but I dont get tingles or good feelings in my body with touch or hugs I dont get warm feelings in my chest and stomach Still just empty I feel like there is no connection at all between my brain and body so the body does not generate an emotional response Sometimes I can feel sad despair in my brain mind if that makes sense but then I cant feel any emotions in my body at all Like the emotion happens outside but not inside I can react in an angry manner with voice changes and body language but on the insade i still cannot Feel that surge of rage Anyone else dont feel any emotions in their body Can this get better https media npr org assets img 2013 12 30 13 21664 large b12e81ec59ec77bd24c6abc7cf6a221346ed3bdd s1100 c50 jpg I cant really Feel my body It feels like air and like i am not in it It is so strange If i dont touch it its like it is not there And i cant Feel anything in my body It is so strange Maybe i have emotions I cry but inside is empty I cant Feel my body I cant Feel the crying My body feels distant numb and detached When i lay down i dont Feel my body like i am not in it It does not respond and it Feels cold and dead Like i am only in my eyes Is this even possible To Feel nothing in the body I cry and Feel despair but inside it is completely empty Like no reaction I cant Feel it,Emotional Distress
Sorry for the book I just dont have anyone to share this with and im dying too Lol I ve never had one before On a whim when I was feeling really hopeless and sad about life I decided to treat myself and get a reading I know there are lots of fakes and scams and I had a bit if skepticism going in I know a lot of it can be generalized to the majority of people but i do think there are things we cant explain and the way she did the reading felt authentic She had lots of good reviews online and seemed to be legit I dont have an online presence aside from anonymously on Reddit and she didnt ask any questions She just dove in and new all these things about who I am as a person without asking anything Right of the bat she asked me if I had a dog I ve been thinking of getting a dog for a companion even before I moved and broke up with my ex i discussed this as a positive of moving with my therapist last year She said my angels are adamant that I should get a dog and told me that even if I didn t get one one would put one in my life unexpectedly anyways Overall she told me I ve been through a lot of shit and pain but it s all guided me to where I am today and had purpose Also that I ve never really had a choice in what happened in my life I ve always had a feeling deep down that I m just floating through life with no real choice in anything I ve told my ex this before I guess I have always had guides with me through my whole life helping keep me safe and that doesnt happen to just anyone I m vibrating on a higher frequency that attracts craziness and bad people How throughout my life i was always worried about everyone else and their needs but it was never returned to me She spoke with my grandpa who had passed not sure if it was really him and he wanted to tell me to work on my own garden Right now I m like a tomato plant with the small green tomatoes but if I keep tending to my own garden and not others the tomatoes will grow into big juicy ones I teared up a bit at this point because he did have a huge garden that I spent time in with him I also have a spirit guide named Randolph who is a tall butler like man And hes always been there as my spiritual butler Lol She said to ask him for guidance when I m feeling stuck She asked me if I paint which I do but haven t for a long ass time She said to get the biggest canvas I could find and work on it as I m healing She said she got goosebumps focusing on the finished peice that I would make She gave me hope for my future She said I am meant to help kids in some kind of psychological capacity and I m destined to do something bigger than me She said I d meet someone new in the future and that he will love me unlike anything I ve ever known before They will understand me as a person and see me as an equal She said she had the feeling I m scared of having kids which I deeply am She said this new guy will probably change my mind on that because I ll be seen as an equal I m not sure if any if it s real but like I said theres definitely things we cant explain in this world and she knew things no one would know about me since I m very private in general I just really needed this today I just feel less alone and like it was a good decision to break up with my ex cut out toxic family members and take care of me She told me to keep trusting my gut and don t doubt myself becuase I m safe Basically all the shit you should hear from those who love you but with BPD we dont get that luxury I just wanted to share this here with all you lovely people because we dont always get the validation we need and I knew you d understand why this felt good,Emotional Distress
I m 26f and n therapy for more than two years now I learned my diagnosis this January honestly I was buffled because it never crossed my mind but everything makes sense now My so of 7 years was the first I told and when I told him on April I wanted to share it with my friends he was a little hesitant but so was I amp x200B So on April I told them about the diagnosis and that I was uncomfortable at first with it because I became conscious of my behavior and especially mirroring people I wanted to be honest with them that a lot of times I did that with the group and I wanted to change that I just really wanted to be accepted like this trying to be myself without me being their hype man or the echo Fast forward to present I don t know if they don t actually like me or it s just me overthinking stuff But If I don t send a text or basically tell on my own how am I no one is asking or texting me anymore I haven t been invited to anything and even when we supposed to have a group vacation I was completely excluded from the decision talk The most hurtful thing is that I told to let s call her Ann to text me if they decide when they ll video call she naver did So they did the vacation and I was with them 2 days out of 7 because I couldn t change my schedule since it was last minute Right when I left they proceed calling me random times and asking me where I was when they knew I worked at this hour I felt like they tried to catch me on a lie The next day I video called Jim put the phone on a table and left me there just to listen to them as they did whatever That was it amp x200B They seem all cheery and excited when I log in on a discord call and I feel like I made all those up I haven t express any concern or feeling towards any of them But I have seen Ann and Jim on action shitting the other 2 people and then 5 minutes later talking to them like nothing happened On the other hand I noticed that everytime we talk or hang around 3 out of 5 in the group always talk about them self and seem bother when someone says anything else It feels more like a group trying to monologue what they did in their day and one up who has it worse They seems to grow bitter of the world everyday maybe they were like this and I didn t notice Plus I amp x200B I think surgerymaybe I pushed them away with my diagnosis but even before that when my mother needed blood for a amp x200B people what was your experience with your friends after diagnosis and what do you think of this I know in a logical level that they just ain t for Fellow people what was your experience with your friends after diagnosis and what do you think of this I know in a logical level that they just ain t for but I still feel fear to leave tho I don t know if they even notice,Emotional Distress
I am a 20 yr old male recently diagnosed with BPD who is looking for advice on how to cope with this diagnosis It feels like bpd in males is rare making the stigma feel heavy Relationships have always been unstable and spending habits terrible DBT is starting soon but it feels like there is no point when I m already this far behind,Emotional Distress
I don Äôt think this is really related to bpd but I just really need some perspective on this So 2 years ago when I was 17 I was admitted to the adult psych ward and a few days after meeting a couple of people there was this one 38 y o man that was getting close to me At first he kinda did some weird stuff like making me hug him and his friend and also hold his hand while walking around but that didn Äôt bother me that much It got weirder when my roommate told me he would stand outside my room at night and he would also talk about how he wants to fuck me but again I really didn Äôt care Then on my last day at the ward in front of everyone he groped me I don Äôt know if that Äôs considered sexual assault or not I started crying and the nurses took me to a room to try and comfort me The thing is I cried for like 10 mins but then that was it I called my mom to tell her and she told me to never talk about this again or tell anyone which kind of hurt my feeling because I felt like she was blaming me Anyways I brushed it off and I never thought about it again but then for the two years after that I kept having a reoccurring nightmare that crazy white men are chasing me and trying to kill me Now here Äôs my question is this actually a valid reason to be traumatized because I think me being sad over this is just me being dramatic people have gone through worse stuff this guy only groped me it wasn Äôt that bad Also if it is sexual assault why is my brain making me think it was a normal thing and that I probably deserved that,Emotional Distress
theres this person i know we re not friends but we re not lovers either somewhere in that grey zone ive been going back and forth on it for a long time but i cant really tell if i hate them or love them anymore i feel like i love them as much as i hate them im not sure if this is a situation where i should just leave them and move on for both our sakes or try to stay and fix our relationship on one hand i feel like wed both be better off if we just stopped talking i even instinctively blocked them because it just felt right to do but on the other i feel like this might happen in any relationship i have so i might as well try and make some progress to improving myself this is a large part a rant but id also like to know what you would have done in a situation like this or have done,Emotional Distress
I recently met a wonderful woman with BPD Hit it off great She is amazing in every way Very intelligent emotional and general very open and communicated effectively very beautiful self aware and our personalities compliment each other very well Things progressed very fast but never felt rushed She was very easy to talk to I sensed a little codependency but never problematic I offered reassurance when I noticed She seemed to greatly appreciate it We were both very infatuated with each other and she even confessed to taking for me Everything was very comfortable feeling so I reciprocated my feelings Not something I would typically do this early in a relationship but they were genuine I truly felt like I saw her Not symptoms of a disorder not the things she said Her at her core And I loved what I saw The next day I was discarded with a lengthy text She mentioned my love confession being part of the reason And that she was splitting which is a term I hadn t heard until then I ve been reading on the subject trying to make sense of the situation and have a very basic understanding now But the whole situation is very confusing I m not sure I ve ever been more confused Really I m just looking for some insight I assume I m now on the bad side of her splitting Is she likey to reach out Should I try to reach out If I am on the bad side of splitting should I move on Dating someone with BPD seems to have a completely different set of expectations than with people without I truly believe I can handle the hardships that follow dating someone with BPD But maybe I m naive I have no clue I ve never met someone who has ALL the characteristics I look for in a person And she does,Emotional Distress
I get so anxious and worried that he Äôs losing feelings just because I Äôm not with him in person I keep overthinking and it Äôs making me miserable I Äôve tried distracting myself but I keep checking my phone for notifications from him I cannot get this man out of my mind I keep thinking Äúwhat if he realizes I Äôm a piece of shit and decides to leave me ÄùHow do you guys cope with this kind of behavior because it Äôs so debilitating My life literally stops when he Äôs not here,Emotional Distress
i can Äôt even express how upset this has been making me the ENTIRE day context i Äôm 21 years old my bf is 24 we Äôre in a not new but not super long term healthy relationship the baby was not planned but it also wasn Äôt unwelcome i know for a fact that i Äôm fully capable of having this child and raising it well Äî i have the financial means the support around me my college degree is in child study development and i Äôve always wanted a child bf is on board i Äôm currently 6 weeks 2 days pregnant BUT he told his parents yesterday who immediately decided that it NEEDS to be aborted Today his mother found and went through my entire tik tok account which is centered around bpd bpd awareness and venting and told him that i need to not have the baby Äúfor my sake Äù based on all of my issues and that he Äúneeds to take a step back from the whole relationship Äù because of them so not only does she think my bpd makes me incapable of raising a child but also unworthy of dating her son ive done SO much work on myself to become a healthy stable person and his mother has NEVER had an issue with me before and is now weaponizing my bpd against me as making me incapable of parenthood suddenly im crazy and incapable i Äôm so upset advice commiseration questions whatever you want is welcome in comments,Emotional Distress

So I Äôm going to start by explaining to you guys about what my adoptive dad AD has done and go from there So needless to say without the gory details he was extremely abusive used gifts and vacations as his was of saying and showing he was a good dad woman he was in relationships with where more important than I was and he had SA Äôd me from age 4 15 as well as when I was 20 when I found out he wasn Äôt even my biological dad but my biological dad Äôs cousin and I was given to him as a replacement for his biological daughter who died at birth due to my adoptive mother Äôs substance abuse and My biological father didn Äôt want me to be raised in Russia around him as it wasn Äôt safe I hadn Äôt spoken to him for around 2 years stopped talking to him when I was 21 and I just now started talking to him again and Im 23 now and recently I had started to talk with him because I got engaged and it would be a major issue for my personal beliefs and traditions if I didn Äôt at least tell him about it and offer for him to be involved Needless to say since doing so a lot of memories are coming up and I am having a hard time trying to figure out if I made the right decision on trying to create a relationship with him I know the boundaries I have to put in place for him and I know I don Äôt have to do it but at the same time I am doing a lot better for myself now mentally and physically and I feel like I should at least try to have a relationship with him but I don Äôt know if It is going to end up being the best thing for my mental health,Emotional Distress

I texted my friend about like lip gloss and then about something else and she completely ignored it and texted me about something else I ve had other friends do this to me and it makes me feel horrible Like why are you ignoring what I just said It s so rude I might as well not have any friends Is this like a normal thing that people do when texting someone,Emotional Distress
It Äôs as straightforward as that After my favourite person broke up with me he dumped everything I did to him onto me According to him I was manipulative tested him constantly put words in his mouth and ignored him countless times I feel absolutely awful because I can Äôt even remember doing half of those things I came from a really mentally abusive household and got BPD fairly early into the relationship I have awful abandonment issues from past relationships and I Äôm very clingy It caused me extreme anger outbursts and anxiety to which I Äôd constantly ask if he liked someone else or that I Äôd question if he messaged someone before me or called someone before acknowledging me He says I have no right to use my BPD or trauma as an excuse for this I think I Äôm just abusive,Emotional Distress
I am here to get this off my chest I can Äôt remember what my parents did to me but I do know that they Äôre abusive that Äôs how it started and going into my teenage years I didn Äôt not realize my actions my pain and my fears I did not know my actions had consequences and I did not know that I needed help Fast forward into my college years that Äôs when my trauma unleashes and I developed new traumas as well I had been dragged to hell and back and hurt a lot of people some where not my fault but it still messed me up and going out of college I realized that no matter how much I try and I apologize yes I do apologize and i am aware of my own actions I just go back to my ways and just find new people and hurt them and I don Äôt even realize that I Äôm hurting them and that Äôs when I got my diagnoses I have been trying hard as f ck and it Äôs kinda still not working I refuse to make new friends and I refuse to date people not until I can afford therapy I just want everyone to know that I have wonderful friends that actually care for me but sometimes I doubt myself like what if I am manipulating them and what if I Äôm unintentionally hurting them All of my past romantic relationships have led to a mess I have a high body count and I never knew that this was due to something I stopped completely hooking up I only seek meaningful relationships now These past few days I have been thinking about how badly I hurt people and the guilt is eating me up it Äôs almost chronic yes I have apologized I can Äôt help but wonder what if I hurt people people I don Äôt know what to do anymore I go on google and see people just talking about how people with bpd severely need therapy and it breaks my heart because I cannot afford that I just want to live a happy and peaceful life without hurting anyone I feel like my whole life is a lie these past few days I feel like I do not know who I am and it breaks my heart so much especially because I have no idea where this all is leading to I want to love people and be loved I want to have healthy thoughts because I doubt myself,Emotional Distress
It Äôs a day late to post this but I thought why not since I can Äôt quite mention it to anyone else close lol My sadly toxic fp and I made up for the first time in a terribly rocky month After going back and forth and just it blowing out of proportion I had daydreamed that at least I Äôd like an apology from him and a means to remain friends Yesterday a friend said he fp wanted to know if he could keep my shirt since he uh Ä you know does his deeds to it apperntly I told him that he shouldn Äôt make u do that and to tell him to talk to me personally We unblocked one another and spoke like adults and managed to set up a time to meet up since he said he wanted to clear the air etc And strangely enough it kinda played out how I had daydreamed it It was of course both of us chugging Smirnoff Äôs definitely the step in the right direction I do regret allowing us to go the other direction we stupidly did some frisky stuff after we hugged and apologized he kept admitting he beats himself up for not allowing himself to have a good thing with me which I Äôm glad because he Äôs truly given me hell this past month like terrible splitting and seeking a way to fix this at all cost again Ä but I did enjoy one thing When he was hugging me he would pull away and kiss my forehead cheek and a normal kiss It made me feel special like I was safe again Ä I Äôve always considered him strangely as my safe space since I have bad memories with males in general touching me and just tell me he loves me and etc Äô it meant a lot last night Ä He continued to behave the same cold and dismissive sometimes saying or doing things to make me jealous again ugh it Äôs dumb today at work and didn Äôt bother to suggest us hanging out tonight to drink or cuddle again At least I have that peace now I Äôll definetly keep doing my DBT workbook and just praying and daydreaming manifesting for good things to come my way I can Äôt count on him to be there for me if I split and breakdown but I can be there for him when he drunk calls me and he Äôs broken cus ig at the end of the day I can Äôt numb myself enough still to hate him yet And maybe that Äôs better maybe numbing myself isn Äôt the solution most days,Emotional Distress
I Äôm gonna be moving in with my boyfriend in exactly a week and somehow I Äôm freaking out Ä We Äôve been talking for a long time and I feel like we know each other pretty well He Äôs been supportive with my episodes and mood swings and overall I feel like he Äôs something good in my life Regardless I can Äôt help but overthink and try to sabotage this relationship by thinking that he might be just like my last relationships abusive toxic etc Ä I just think this is Äútoo good to be true Äù because my relationships have been literal hell and it Äôs the first time that I Äôm feeling happy about a relationship A lot of parts about being in a relationship scare me a lot and at times I Äôm even wondering if I should be in a relationship I just feel like I Äôm so behind with basic skills like Äúshowing love through physical touch Äù or even Äúgiving compliments Äù and I hate it I really feel like I shouldn Äôt be getting into this but I also feel that it Äôs just the BPD talking The sexual part of the relationship also scares me since I Äôve been SA Äôd in the past and since I haven Äôt done it in a while it really scares me Also we haven Äôt been intimate in that way yet and since we Äôre going to be living together that Äôs bound to happen at some point Ä I really just don Äôt want to be a disappointment and be abandoned again because I honestly can Äôt do this anymore,Emotional Distress
Its so heartbreaking to feel this way all the time I hate it Every time my partner comforts me about loving me or not leaving all i can think is Äúeven if u truly believe this now some day it wont be the truth Äù I feel guilty because i wish i could just let them help me and make everything better Every time i start to get closer to a group of friends i think Äúthis is fun for now but eventually things won Äôt be the same and they probably would have more fun without me anyway Äù Its like even if i can convince myself that the current moment is ok which is already hard to do alone I have to remind myself that i KNOW it wont stay ok Im so so very sure nothing will stay ok And its almost impossible to use this in a comforting way bc as soon as something bad happens its like my brain turns to self destruct mode Like instead of thinking Äúit Äôll get better Äù i think Äúlook i knew nothing would stay ok it never does so before i get happy and hurt again lets just leave Äù Idk this is very ranty im just so tired of knowing that nothing will be ok,Emotional Distress
Why is it so hard for girls to maintain close relationships with other girls I Äôm a girl and I feel more complete when I have a close girl friend someone who wants to talk or hang out every day And every time I find someone who wants that close relationship they always end up disappointing me and triggering my abandonment issues even if I try to work things out I always have to cut them off to stay mentally healthy at some point Is the desire to have a really close friend like that one I should try to just work through and give up on,Emotional Distress

Wondered if anyone has any tips on responding assertively in the moment If someone is actively hurtful I find it far easier but there s so many subtle ways people can be invalidating condescending or trigger anxiety When it happens my mind tends to space out as they continue talking and if I confront them it s nearly always afterwards which can feel completely pointless if it s something small I m caught between struggling to read people during my interactions with them and distrusting my memory of said interaction because of my tendency to react to what was said later I know this is most likely a trauma response on my part and a way of people pleasing but it s incredibly frustrating,Emotional Distress

Hey everyone Recently Ä well specifically Ä about a week ago I was diagnosed by BPD with a trip to the clinic with my mum I Äôm still fairly young about 16 so pardon me if I have poor writing or accidentally bash something I Äôm looking for a better understanding of the disorder as I want to improve and fix myself something I Äôve always strived to do and I figured that speaking to what may be a majority of first hand resources would be the smartest way to do that Before anyone asks I do have other disorders though unless they Äôre important I Äôd prefer not speaking about them Questions 1 I see a lot of Ä negativity and bashing of BPD online which I won Äôt vent about obviously Though it Äôs really hard to understand the point of going forward in life if I feel like Ä I don Äôt know Ä kind of like we Äôre all destined to fail Like we can only provide toxicity Is it possible to be a good person with BPD or at least grow to become one 2 Do you have any resources This is kinda just it for the question Ä any possible resources for self improvement or even just advice would be nice 3 How do you handle your emotional issues like anger or depression or even impulsivity,Emotional Distress

In my country we still have mask rules for health care providers and places where social distancing isn t available wearing masks is reccomended Now a few of my therapists have said some things that are concerning with covid 1 My main therapist said that she hates wearing masks and she removed it when we were in my private session I was obviously uncomfortable with it 2 During my skills training one of my therapists said they don t believe covid spreads through touch they said this while cleaning the objects we used during mindfulness Like if it didn t spread through touch masks would have just stopped covid right Another thing thats stressful is that in group skills training one person keeps removing their mask and openly coughing while wearing a chin diaper They were sniffling and coughing and said they didn t do a covid test I have other health conditions that make me have to take meds that lower my immune response to sickness So the common cold could cause serve damages It makes me very stressed and nervous going into group and one on one because of this Do I contact my therapist directly about how she makes me uncomfortable and do I ask to be put in a different group Idk what to do,Emotional Distress

This is a serious question After having a 2 year relationship with a Cluster B person And despite all the trauma it has caused me I don t like the stigma online towards people with Cluster B And I don t like that it s classified as a mental illness To me I see it as a feature a genetic attribute Something like hair color or height Do we call people with red hair ill And give them medicine to fix it I just don t get this need to unify people into a common standard instead of accepting their diversity My exGF was a Cluster B and I know it was hard for both of us But remembering her it was always something I loved about her and I probably would have never fallen in love if she wasn t a pwBPD Please stop the stigma and accept people for who they are,Safe/Neutral

They seem to definitely like their Äòalone time Äô they Äôre really hard working and busy a lot That Äôs fine with me too I guess at this early stage it remains to be seen whether that theme sticks anyway We Äôre similar in that way We Äôre both 30 years old They described themselves as someone with Äòquiet BPD Äô vs Äòloud BPD Äô I Äôve looked at alot of the top post list but thought I Äôd ask here is there anything I could know As the relationship progresses and perhaps as I would expect they and I to spend more time together if it remained at a state of seeing them once a week I might begin to think they are maybe keeping me at arms length for more nuanced reasons Is this expected I guess I Äôm looking for a bit more anecdotal advice versus what googling ÄòBPD and romance Äô etc gives me which I have done Thanks,Safe/Neutral

I think of myself 18 M as a very supportive and understanding person I encouraged her to attend therapy and take meds We both just recently found out it was excactly BPD she has been having problems with What are some things i might need to know about talking to her or interacting in any way possible We are a couple for 3 month from now on Im also interested if her emotions towards me may be a result of BPD effect We never had problems with her suddenly losing interest in me or something because I know it happens in many cases,Safe/Neutral
Why is society so afraid of emotion The looks people give you if you let yourself cry on the street The looks you get if you allow yourself to express your honest emotions in public It s crazy to me how out of touch normal people are with their emotions It s like they are afraid of their own feelings They will do just about anything just to avoid having to feel their genuine emotions Western culture seems to completely stigmatise having emotions at all Why should anyone feel shame for feeling something that makes life beautiful Emotions are what drives everyone Some people are simply more sensitive some are less sensitive we all have different temperaments but I believe everyone is driven by emotion Some are driven by the desperate need to suppress their emotions to suppress the pain they feel some strive to experience their emotions to the fullest Sensitivity in our society is viewed as being weak or even ill but sensitivity and emotion is what allows us to experience the beauty of life and the beauty of the world it allows us to be creative it brings intuition authenticity and self expression Exploring some spiritual path can open so many creative outputs So many normal people who fit into the expected norms of society seem to be so emotionally shut down and disconnected from their feelings They just seem to build and build the frustration that comes with supressing the emotions that they are too afraid to face I think there is always some meaning to the emotions and experiences we have even pain carries value that can make us grow and move forward Our internal experiences should never be something to be ashamed of even mental illness is not just an illness even if people are so quick to judge It s important to let ourselves feel The power of just letting ourselves feel what we need to feel can be incredible Sometimes a crisis is what leads you on an important path if you can successfully navigate the situation Sometimes a breakdown is what brings the biggest breakthrough It can lead you to wisdom understanding acceptance and a new importance and meaning to your life,Safe/Neutral

I m not sure if this phenomenon is limited to Reddit and I m not certain that it expands to all of society That being said it is very clear that Reddit favors extreme views that have momentum That s how the upvote system works It s not based on fact or logic it s based on human response which is usually emotional If human response were logical we would not have so many factually wrong posts hitting the front page with their top comments being corrections that debunk the post in question Reddit is like other social media in that it triggers a kind of immune response A threat is all bad Any time a post is made about a celebrity doing a bad thing the comments will be riddled with the phrase piece of shit A person is either all good or all bad according to Reddit s hivemind The upvoted comments will reinforce this and the downvoted comments are the ones questioning it The voice of reason is shut down entirely by clicks,Safe/Neutral

Bpd doesn t make you a monster Knowingly hurting people and then purposely refusing the go to therapy and get help and work on yourself makes you a f cking monster The trolls on here are literally people who have been immensely hurt by someone who had bpd so hurt that they literally discriminate against every single other person with the disorder and are out to get revenge That s the same type of mindset as a racist sexist etc BE NICE TO THEM Prove them wrong Help them heal from the past It s something that we can combat and we can do it the right way together And look I know what they re doing is wrong so why should we bother to be nice to them right Well The person was probably put through hell there s literally no way to justify that Having compassion for them is another way to show just how wrong they are about us,Safe/Neutral

I was hospitalized a few weeks ago and I Äôve been a lot more conscious of my mental health I Äôve enrolled in DBT at the suggestion of my doctors in the hospital I Äôve always thought been told that I have major depression but a couple of days ago my therapist revealed that she suspects I have BPD We did some preliminary tests and it Äôs Äúprobable Äù that I have BPD We Äôre going to do more testing but the more I read about it the more it explains a lot of my behavior Anyway I Äôm not mad or upset about it I need to change my medicine if I do actually have BPD but that Äôs about it I think mental illness has this stigma that you can Äôt live a full life while having a diagnosis and I just want to hear some encouraging stories for once If anyone has any uplifting stories about living a good life while still dealing with BPD drop them below,Safe/Neutral

So I been talking to this guy for four months and I noticed him wanting a lot more alone time as time went on He does like me a lot be also values being alone He told me he likes being alone but not by himself if that makes sense He does come back to me at the end of the day and calls and tells me he appreciates me and cares about me Just lately he s been pushing me away because whenever people get close to him including his own family he feels extreme discomfort and serious expectations I told him this is similar to my brother with BPD s behavior He told me I am his favorite person and he is going to work towards discussing with his therapist on what would be best for him to manage this In the mean time we are kind of at a stand still and I am not sure what would be best for me to do He asked for space but still wants to text and call but not see me in person He does love and care about me it is just confusing at times I am not necessarily sure on what to do because I never dated someone who valued alone time wants comfort and feels discomfort at closeness I know one thing is I shouldn t rush him to get help so I have been very mindful and careful If this does seem like BPD behavior what else can I do to make it easier for him,Safe/Neutral

I m not asking for a diagnosis I know that isn t possible I d just like advice on how to deal with the numerous issues caused by a coworker who I think may have BPD or a related disorder This person tends to fixate on a particular person at a time becoming very friendly and extremely helpful but then some perceived slight will send them in the opposite direction almost hating that person which is often accompanied by late night drunken and angry texts and a terrible working environment This person has done this to a number of people in our office These slights that put them over the top are always huge distortions of very minor problems at work If this is BPD what would be the best way to deal with or deescalate when such situations arise,Safe/Neutral

There Äôs this girl at my job that I Äôm interested in I feel that we get along really well together We always tease each other her doing it more and I catch her glancing at me a lot Sometimes I Äôll look up and she Äôs literally right there and she just smiles at me I do like being around her Yesterday we were talking and she randomly told me that she takes antidepressants and had BPD Inside i was shocked but I managed to keep a calm face I asked her what BPD was and she said it Äôs borderline personality disorder and to summarize she said she didn Äôt have her own personality and just takes popular traits that people would like I said oh that sounds normal and she laughed and said no it Äôs not I Äôm not really sure why she told me all this maybe she just likes my calm presence Idk lol After she told me a little later she was way more in my face and trying to talk to me and making fun of me more and smiling and of course I acted the same way as I usually do As I Äôve been reading more into BPD I Äôm a little hesitant and the responses I get are to not date someone with BPD But I feel like every person is different so I want to keep trying even though she probably doesn Äôt like me like that I guess what I Äôm asking is dating someone with BPD really that difficult Even though I don Äôt have a shot with her I Äôd like to hear some thoughts from people who do have BPD,Safe/Neutral

After a year and 3 months with a 24M I 22F made the decision to finally officially break up It wasn t easy and it s going to be messy because we currently live together in an apartment but that isn t enough to keep me in a relationship where I m not happy I tried breaking up with him once before but relapsed because I thought maybe I had only split on him I realize now that it isn t what I want I wrote a list of reasons so if I ever forget why I can reference it I wish I did that for my past exes When things weren t well with current boyfriends I would regret breaking up with this one really special guy but it s only the good stuff I remember I wish I wrote why I made the decision then But it s okay because my counselor remembers and reminds me of it when I cycle back to those feelings Amidst all this I also discovered how much support I actually have around me My real family is being surprisingly supportive my second family is encouraging and empowering as always my favorite coworker is proud I m not letting myself stay somewhere I m not happy My biggest concern was existing and affording to live by myself That s not something I ever thought I was capable of but there s stuff I can apply for to help I only work in fast food for now and I m studying in college full time I m hoping for SNAP and I might apply for Medicaid if it will cover my mental health 100 My current counselor is out of network with my dad s insurance plan Through all of this I just want you guys to know that sometimes it will feel hopeless but everything works out in the end There are day where I feel like a boss ass bitch ready to conquer the world Days where I fully believe I have the support I need around me Then there are days where I feel unlovable unworthy and empty My plan is to journal on the days where I m feeling great so I can read it when I m feeling bad TL DR I finally broke up with my boyfriend and it s made me realize so many things Everything is going to work out in the end I just have to trust it and find ways to remember that on the bad days,Safe/Neutral
So i just recently started DBT individual sessions with group sessions planned for next month I went to therapy for most of my life but never really clicked with therapists and I was always questioning the effectiveness of the sessions This new therapist I m having seems quite good and I ve been enjoying the sessions with her but this last one I felt like she was doing some odd things and guided the discussion in unexpected and imo not necessarily productive directions But I m wondering if this is just how DBT is cause I ve never done it before so I might be expecting the wrong thing She was asking questions after questions and didn t elaborate or ask me to elaborate on things that felt relevant to me For example I was saying how my relationship is perfectly fine atm but I feel bored and would just want something exciting to happen even if it d be something negative And she was like yeah that s your BPD talking and then went on to ask me about how I ve adjusted to the new city Is this normal we did some mindfulness exercises as well so it wasn t just her interviewing me for 50 minutes straight but even with those i was expecting to discuss some things and then she was just like so I ll see you next week then Am i missing something here,Safe/Neutral

I recently read well listened to the free audiobook on YouTube of Mans Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl for a psychology class and I actually learned a lot about myself and indirectly BPD from it He talks about his experience in a concentration camp and what he learned from it about finding meaning in life even when facing unbearable suffering losing hope and what it does to us physically trauma suicide and many other topics that can relate to us with bpd He then explains his theories about how to live a meaningful and fulfilling life and specific ways to do it even for people who the thought of living seems to excessively painful and not realistic What stuck with me most was his explanation of having the right mindset about pain and suffering and how to actually find meaning and a will to live with it Obviously when I split all that knowledge seems to go out the window along with logic and reasoning but learning it thinking about it and practicing it during better times helps a little bit of that perspective maintain throughout the dark times It has shown me new and helpful perspectives and helped me me have a better outlook on life so I wanted to share it with my fellow bpd friends hopefully it can help you as well I Äôm not much of a reader so the audiobook was super helpful just look up mans search of meaning on YouTube and you Äôll find it Takes about 4hrs to listen to so if you have the time I Äôd definitely recommend it,Safe/Neutral

Everyday I see more and more posts asking How can I _ _ _ _ with BPD How to _ _ _ _ _ with BPD There was a time I fell into that same kind of thinking I want to note here I was diagnosed with BPD for a brief amount of time lt 6 mo until I saw a specialist who pointed me in a different direction He believed I was misdiagnosed However due to severe abuse I had enough of the BPD symptoms that a psychiatrist did believe I had it Symptoms were as follows Antisocial behavior and social isolation Anxiety general discontent guilt and loneliness Depression distorted self image and grandiosity Essentially I was pretty fucked up I am happy to say I do not relate to many of those anymore especially those of a more toxic nature but I wanted to come here and say there is no one how to It works differently for everyone Thats like asking how to be a good writer There is no one way Everyone has their own style of living If everyone learned how to be good through the advice of others the world would all be one or two shades of the same color Now I am not saying be you but instead I will push you to live a healthier fuller life and see what comes of it My suggestions on how to live a life worth living 1 Sleep no less than seven hours a night but no more than ten 2 When you wake up in the morning make your bed or sleeping space If you have a partner maybe they will get in on this with you It can be fun to do a little chore together before you start the day 3 Spend ten minutes in the morning just breathing Lay on your floor or somewhere you feel completely safe for me for a time this was a small closet It will feel uncomfortable When you have those urges to get up and walk away from it think of why you want to get better You may feel the need to cry for seemingly no reason Then cry Maybe laugh Then laugh Just be for ten minutes No expectations 4 Immediately following your meditation I know spooky word read a book It doesnt matter what book any book will do For at least ten minutes Bonus points if you play classical music in the background Classical is known to be good for your mental health and its a good ambient noise 5 Try to drink water I know it sucks Typically I will put a little lemon in my water to make it go down easier 6 Do something small for yourself that makes you feel beautiful This can be taking a shower with fancy soap or doing your hair Just one thing Everyday 7 Do at least 10 minutes of exercise Walking to your local coffee shop or school or work does count 8 Genuinely compliment one person every day Find something in someone else you genuinely like Compliment them It will make you feel better even if you think it won t 9 Cook at least 2 meals for yourself over the course of the week 10 Use I feel statements when you are frustrated with someone Teach them how to respond This one is going to sound the least organic but it is so helpful and has saved my relationship When you are frustrated use I feel statements It looks something like this When I don t receive any texts all day I feel unloved and scared I mean less to you somehow Your partner responds I hear that you feel unloved and scared when I do not text you all day When I hear that I feel sad because I love you so much and I got very busy at work today and honestly it slipped my mind You would respond I hear that you were so busy at work today and it slipped your mind That is extremely healthy Its open communication without blame Attempt to use the least amount of you s possible during the I feel statements I know these sound self help y but please I am begging you Do these things for three weeks and you will see a massive difference in yourself,Safe/Neutral

So I have been together with my BPD partner for 8 years Though it has it s challenges I know she is a loving person and a wonderful mother and during this time ive learned a lot about myself and her and a bit about BPD so today we had a conflict and the details arent important after the emotional flare up I realised that in her case the way she communicates it s as if I dont have feelings that can get hurt or that I respond to after being hurt sometimes with emotion as well I admit thoughh rarely briefly and not severely and I saw this quality of her not seeing my emotions because she was brought up basically by an only parent and when visiting the other parent he was quite tyrannical When as a teen arguing with parents OF COURSE you dont put their feelings into consideration and without siblings this one way emotionality would be thought of as the norm And OF COURSE as you argue you would develop all the aggressive unfair manipulative verbal and physical tools to win whatever situation would arise and OF COURSE that person girl in this case would fall to pieces if there was ever actually any emotional pushback from the father scary guy and feelings of being trapped in violence All this was happening in miniature today Perhaps Im just writing down my thoughts the event today was made so much better calmed much more quickly because I explained how some of the interaction before her explosion hurt MY feelings It made her more quickly see the whole situation as not just I did nothing wrong and this guy is a monster For the first time almost ever she acknowledged that she also had made a mistake I had already acknowledged and apologised for my mistakes in the altercation That s progress So my overly simple possibly stupid question to anyone reading this is are you a person who was raised by single parents I d like to see if it is even more slightly common amongst single parent raised kids while well aware this place or the replies wont be scientific at all 8n results and frankly any psychological profile is created in probably many complex social upbringings But maybe as a spectrum question I would be interested in hearing some replies Thanks for reading and hopefully contributing though I feel better just writing this here,Safe/Neutral

I m not by anyway comparing BPD to bipolar I just realize how similar the episodes be and they can occur in a matter of a day I swear when things are going surprisingly well for me or I am having the time of my life The happiness and confidence I experience is on a level similar to hypomania This is the whole reason I thought I had bipolar first before I knew what BPD was I get so happy chatty and even confident when I m in a scenario where I flourish But come a time where I am alone and can think I start hyperanalyzing every move I did when I was in that state I ve been able to control those thoughts better with a few lifestyle changes But I still get these random euphoric episodes and then in a couple hours I m neutral not talking as much or not as confident so I m sure this confuses people It very well could be my medication as well that s aggravating it but I used to have similar episodes off meds Maybe not as often but I did Anyone like this,Safe/Neutral
So I Äôve had a few small victories over the last 5 months or so I have been off medication since late January Went from therapy twice a week to once a week to now biweekly I have gone from having emotional rage filled outburst almost on a weekly basis to maybe once a month if that or less I Äôve gotten so much better at understanding expressing and feeling my emotions Äîthis has also helped with my depression I can Äôt recall the last time I had a prolonged depressive episode I just don Äôt feel like I Äôm in crisis mode anymore I feel like a completely different person than I was a year ago My mental health as well as my physical health are in the best state they Äôve been in awhile I Äôve also gone from not stepping into a gym for nearly 7 months to now going to the gym 5 6 days a week and feel so much more disciplined and proud of myself All this to say I just don Äôt feel like therapy and group DBT is serving me any longer I am slowly approaching my required 6 month participation mark for my DBT Skills group Every week I find it harder and harder to not only attend group but to complete the assignments as well I just don Äôt feel like I identify with it anymore for a lack of better words I Äôm starting to find therapy draining and triggering if I Äôm completely honest And it Äôs not because I just don Äôt want to do it or I Äôm not invested I just feel like I don Äôt particularly Äúneed Äù it anymore I Äôve been in such a good place these last few months and my question is how do I know when is the right time to walk away and take a break from therapy all together Ä I just finished my DBT group session We typically go over our homework one by one at the beginning of group I actually struggled completing this assignment but still pushed through and completed it When it was my turn to share I had to be honest and let my group know it was difficult for me to complete the assignment and that it was triggering for me I even found myself being overwhelmed a bit with emotions because it Äôs just become so draining I guess I Äôm just curious of others experience with treatment therapy and DBT How far did you get through DBT treatment and when did you know you were in a place to take a break,Safe/Neutral

TLDR Do strong feelings for loved ones make symptoms harder to control around those people Hi everyone Sorry for the possibly stupid question but my now ex hopefully not forever revealed he was diagnosed with BPD some time ago after our breakup The cause of our breakup was a full out rage episode directed at me We are on speaking terms now and hopefully we can at least make things work as friends considering how much we have in common Last night he told me that he had done quite a bit of DBT previously and was in remission prior to meeting me While he has had some other relationships max 6 months in duration he told me I was everything he Äôd wanted and immediately he felt so comfortable with me and knew I was special He tells me having such strong feelings for me in some ways makes his impulses outbursts harder to control as those feelings Äúamplify emotions 10x Äù Knowing the little bit about BPD I know now I Äôm pretty sure I was his FP and possibly still am I know there aren Äôt excuses for verbally abusing people He Äôs back in counseling and he Äôs trying to do better but he is really struggling with the difficult conversations about what caused the breakdown of our relationship When he feels hurt his reactions read like anger Do you all agree with his sentiment of things being harder to manage with people you care the most about,Safe/Neutral
It s interesting because I have seasonal friends Literally during the winter I m usually stuck with messaging a couple of people doing hobbies and working I sometimes see people here and there I live in Canada so there is no spring we literally go from a super long winter to a short super hot summer Anyways come summer time I have so many friends that I hung out with last summer pop out of nowhere like a wild pikachu We get along super well in the summer but come winter time They aren t really nowhere to be seen It s a legit pattern and the last time I really see them is usually at the university homecoming party that they go to I m pretty sure we are all graduated now so I don t think that s going to be happening in the future I also don t like getting plastered anymore which university culture seems to like Alcohol and BPD don t mix I m almost certain they aren t real friends but whatever to be honest I enjoy the cliff jumping we do into water the swimming and the hikes I made some great memories in the past unfortunately I have been plastered for many of them I am trying to make more memories sober Haven t had a drink in a month Considering stopping completely or just drink on the rare occasion but not get plastered Anyone here have seasonal friends,Safe/Neutral
Long story short I ve been talking to this guy for over a month and we both acknowledged that we liked each other but there s no way we could turn out to be something long term we re in diff countries and just happened to know each other So I d taken a break from insta for a week by deactivating my account the only way he could access to me is my spotify and another insta that I don t use very often He added songs to my playlist during that one week and clearly still showed that he thought about me Now I came back and suddenly he started acting distant I asked him about it and he said he thinks we should keep distance because it s gonna go nowhere for the both of us but then continue to like my story Yesterday he texted me first and I replied but then he never did so I unsent that message He clearly knew I did but didn t say anything A few hours later I saw him hearting a pic of this girl who s been commenting things on his posts tho he doesn t reply ever and I immediately unfollowed him on everything Now I kinda wonder if I made the right choice or I was being impulsive and he was just being confused about how he feels I think I should have talked to him first or something rather than unfollowing everything like that Any thoughts,Safe/Neutral
After extensive testing I was told by a psychiatrist that BPD could be one of my diagnoses I am aware of what parts of my personality match up with that However I tend to go through fixations on certain topics every 6 months to 2 years For example I was super into royal families then personality tests and now I m really interested in public transit and the housing market ADHD has definitely been ruled out and I am curious if the rumination common with BPD can extend to that I also am aware it could be tied to something else entirely but just curious about others experiences,Safe/Neutral
I was on Abilify for almost two weeks and it made me spiral into a manic episode that lasted like 5 7 days my psychiatrist assumes I also have bipolar disorder or bipolar depression I had a session with my psychiatrist yesterday and he prescribed me Zyprexa So now I ve been put on Zyprexa with my Klonopin I haven t seen anyone talking about what it s like for someone with BPD All I ve heard is that it makes you hungry and makes you gain tons of weight which I actually really need rn so I m fine with that Does anyone here know what it does to those of us with BPD Or at least what I should expect,Safe/Neutral

My Mom has always had what would be clinically described as emotional lability Her emotions are intense and her behaviors and mannerisms can get erratic Most recently she has started using different voices almost as if she s acting when she is upset She has phrases that don t necessarily make sense however are used in these really strange voices when she is angry about something Most recently it has been take back the steal she s a liberal and when my brother started dating someone who s family supported trump she d go on rants that were almost theatrical I can t describe it These personalities come out seemingly out of nowhere She also assumes the personality of whoever she s around down to their mannerisms She s expressed feeling like she has low mood and emptiness She will copy those around her down to mannerisms language tone of voice and volume Initially I thought it was the byproduct of having a really poor sense of self but now I m wondering if it s something more Her personalities range from exhuberantly yelling and calling people girlllll to talking in a low tone and using words that aren t commonly used in conversational settings She had a lot of trouble creating and maintaining friendships when I was growing up She has solid relationships now but she morphs into each of her friends whenever she is around them It s still really hard for her to make genuine connections She also seems to seek out a lot of drama intentionally provoking people and then acting like a victim when they inevitably tell her to stop The inverse of this is a mother and grandmother who loves her children and grandchildren fiercely I really appreciate a lot of things she has done for me and love her Her mental health and anger erratic nature qhas been such a challenge though I am wondering if it s BPD I d love to hear everyone s insight,Safe/Neutral

I just saw a post here about the idea of renaming bpd I think we mostly seem to agree that emotionally unstable personality disorder is just as if not more stigmatizing and that emotional regulation disorder doesn Äôt get to the full range of it I won Äôt fully launch into why I think changing name could help as im creating this post more to say if you could or even had to change the name to increase understanding and reduce stigma what would you change it to but if you really want you can see some of my thinking on name change in my comments on the post im referencing Regardless i think it Äôs important to be aware that bpd is being viewed as more affect based not personality based since we are able to see symptom remission in a way other personality disorders cannot in a way the basis of the term personality disorder suggests we cannot I support this so will not use pd in my renaming suggestions So that being said what would you rename the condition What is your primary experience of the condition If you really feel attached to the idea it Äôs a pd leave it on but I personally think that Äôs actually not the case for the above reasons so again will be doing away with it Some brainstorming from me 1 Abandonment fear is huge component Name based on this Abandonment avoidance disorder Abandonment phobia condition 2 Replace unstable with unbalanced Unstable feels way more stigmatized I think putting it in terms of balance feels much less stigmatized but still quite accurate to everything from Unbalanced affect disorder affective balance disorder I like this one so far it gets at the affective behavioral aspect to things that our treatment responsiveness supports without reducing it to just emotional dysregulation or using the term unstable 3 Sorta similar to two use labile we are quite labile malleable re easy frequent mood switching splitting unstable sense of self this could incorporate dissociation too Con here is that labile is not a very well known term Affective lability disorder 4 The condition is responsive to external things Sensitive External sensitivity disorder This feels too broad some may dislike sensitivity but i do think that sensitivity ia huge part and isn Äôt inherently negative M response sensitization disorder I like this as it gets at how we are sensitized to things our origins being biopsychosocial in that environmental circumstances sensitized us to this condition Instead of response then we could also go with Abandonment sensitization disorder Attachment sensitization disorder Would love to hear other blank sensitization disorder suggestions 5 Maybe pay homage to linehan and dbt with the name This isn Äôt perfect but would help direct you to a solid treatment option from the getgo Dialectical understanding disorder dialectical reasoning disorder since dialects is holding two opposing beliefs together at once and we struggle w this ie black and white thinking and splitting linehan Äôs disorder doesn Äôt explain what it is at all though What do you think Any liked suggestions What would u suggest,Safe/Neutral

Hi everyone Although we Äôve been together for nearly two years and have pretty much known this day was coming for much of that time I must confess I don Äôt feel that I understand bpd as well as I think I should in order to provide the support she needs From what I can tell from other peoples stories I don Äôt think it affects her as severely as other people and I don Äôt feel particularly worried about the future of our relationship However I still don Äôt really understand the topic of splitting and I hope it Äôs okay to ask for some more information about it as I can Äôt find really a lot of reliable information online that seems relevant to our relationship For example is there any way I can differentiate between splitting and a time when she might genuinely be angry at me I hope this isn Äôt a stupid question Also I would be interested in any opinions about being involved in the recovery process I Äôm aware that she only got diagnosed because I asked her to which feels like I pushed her into it and that I crossed a line but the result of her diagnosis is that she Äôs now receiving updated medication that the psychiatrist thinks will help and is now able to receive a higher level of support from our university I Äôm not sure what to think about the situation so I Äôd just love to hear some thoughts on this if possible I want the best for her and for our relationship so just looking to improve my understanding of her situation so I can be more supportive Thank you for any answers I appreciate anything at all,Safe/Neutral
Disclaimer I am diagnosed bpd and ptsd im not trying to make anyone feel ashamed of this disorder in this post but I am curious to see what you all think about my argument A lot of people think that borderline personality disorder should be changed in the DSM to emotional regulation disorder This is called soft language George Carlin talks about it one of his specials He talks about how Post Traumatic Stress Disorder used to be called Shell Shock It was called Shell Shock back in WW1 after doctors started to see the same kind of symptoms in the soldiers during returning from war His point was that this illness wasn Äôt treated as well as it should have been or was seen as serious as it was and is because it was made to sound nicer and less grotesque over time So less funding and care could go toward veterans financial physical and mental well being Bpd is a serious mental illness and should be seen by the public as such When we act the way we do when our worst instincts and behaviors come out some stigma needs to be there for people to understand the severity of what we and the people we Äôre involved with are dealing with No one is going to care about a disorder called emotional regulation disorder It just makes us sound like a bunch of babies and diminishes our pain and the pain we cause others Also bpd is way more than emotion regulation It Äôs also involves paranoia eating disorders drug abuse etc And personality disorder needs to be on the name because IT IS a personality disorder If effects the way behave with others we change how we behave and our beliefs for the people we want to be with Sometimes without even knowing it This goes far beyond emotion regulation,Safe/Neutral

Sorry if I put my question in an insensitive way in the title just not sure how to ask it I have a friend with BPD she told me not trying to diagnose her and she s great in many ways but also very hot and cold and I m trying to understand it more Usually for a few days or weeks she wants to talk and hang out all the time and is generally a loving friend then something changes seemingly prompted by nothing at least I can t see any pattern it might even happen overnight after we say goodbye normally and she straight up ignores me for days or if she responds to texts it s obvious from two word responses that she s not interested in talking I know this is normal for people I too have times when I d rather be alone but I never straight up ignore people and virtually no one else I know tends to do this Once this passes she goes back to normal immediately expecting me to do the same with no explanation of any kind for why she ignored me for days and if I straight up ask her I get a bad excuse I m trying to be patient with her but it s honestly driving me nuts and playing with my own trust issues I m asking here because my first thought was that this is likely be tied to BPD but after looking up a bit about how people experience it I get the feeling that for most people clingyness and fear of abandonment is the more usual manifestation Is this a classic BPD symptom and I m just missing something or does her behavior have nothing to do with it Is it helpful that I let her do this or am I enabling something I shouldn t Any general advice for this is welcome,Safe/Neutral

I really wanted to hear peoples opinions on this topic As I Äôve seen so many people who are for and against it Personally myself I am against self diagnosis Purely for the fact that even therapists can Äôt diagnose you with it and they have years of training I think bpd is very complex and a lot of the time the people with this disorder aren Äôt self aware of their actions I am diagnosed after a long time fighting to know what is wrong with me I know bpd through and through I grew up closely with two family members with it It Äôs a very difficult disease I didn Äôt think I had it 100 until my diagnosis however now I have found peace in it I know I would never self diagnose and I understand the fact that some people don Äôt have access to services and psychiatry however there is a difference between thinking and suspecting you have something rather than saying you have it indefinitely For example you could find a lump on your leg and do lots of research and you think it Äôs cancer However you could go to the doctors and they could say it is something else Understand the point I Äôm getting at For me the internet isn Äôt a trustworthy source and doesn Äôt really cover the true in and outs of the disorder I just don Äôt agree with it Sorry I Äôm open to hearing other peoples opinions so feel free to comment below This isn Äôt a argument more like a discussion And this can be eye opening for a lot of people,Safe/Neutral
Hi everyone I didn Äôt know in which sub to post this so let me know if it Äôs not allowed here I Äôm writing on the behalf of the man I Äôm dating He Äôs 46 years old and some of his behaviors make me think he may have BPD I Äôm not looking for an official diagnosis or anything just for your thoughts on the situation and wether or not it could be a form of mental illness Note I myself have been diagnosed with BPD years ago He Äôs extremely impulsive Can chose to travel halfway across the world on just an impulse He Äôs lived in 4 continents countless of countries acts impulsively on everything wether it is big life decisions or small everyday events Exemple i live across the country from him he will impulsively leave his job and tell me he Äôs coming over the next day He Äôs provoking dangerous situations Purposely goes walking in the middle of the road when he Äôs drunk because he knows he might get run over and he thinks that Äôs adventurous fun Or he will purposely go wander into the dangerous parts of town because that Äôs fun and adventurous Note he absolutely isn Äôt suicidal loves life and is an overall very happy person He Äúdisconnects Äù from people very easily which makes me think of how we BPD people split He will love you intensely and more than anything and then something happens and he will just feel Äúdisconnected Äù his words from you and the love he feels for you He will still KNOW inside that his love exists but he will just not feel it show it not even say ÄúI love you Äù back when an hour before he will be madly in love and scream their love at the top of their lungs This has been a major problem in our relationship as he can Äúdisconnect Äù very easily and I have to deal with him Äúnot loving me Äù while this passes No social boundaries He will absolutely not care about what Äôs socially acceptable or not NSFW engage in kissing when in the middle of the road with a police car waiting just because Äúit Äôs fun Äù climb public buildings etc Idk if it Äôs BPD related but he has almost no empathy for others He doesn Äôt care about anyone except maybe his kids and me He will absolutely don Äôt give a sh t about the situation in Ukraine for exemple or people having bad things happening to them He legit has no compassion whatsoever for others but maybe that Äôs just a facade that he portrays But other than that he doesn Äôt seem to have any other major BPD symptoms He Äôs a very happy person He loves life is never sad never wanted to die and doesn Äôt get anxiety EVER What could that be I know there is some kind of mental issue there but I don Äôt know what it could be Thank you so much for reading and helping,Safe/Neutral

Greetings I have been interested in BPD for some time which I myself suffer from Have you ever wondered that the assumptions that arise in our brains in certain situations can be really real I will give an example You feel from the other person that he wants to deceive you or hurt you Because you have experienced these similar situations several times in your life you will feel her bad intentions You will feel the pattern that people who have hurt you in the past have shown Based on that you will then behave the way you will Impulsive rage because you feel right You use it before her bad intentions come true because you know it can really happen So isn t this more of a talent The ability we have developed over the course of our lives So isn t it more important to deal with impulse and anger than to focus on ignoring your assumptions I will be very happy for your opinions and I wish each of you peace of mind,Safe/Neutral
Sometimes I can only describe that I perceive another part of me is me in that present moment and that me is different to me who I generally perceive myself to be I know that sounded complex and confusing I wonder do many people with BPD experience dissociated parts that at times result in dramatic shifts in personality that fairly frequently you reflect back and can only think to yourself Äòwow that was me but not like me and now I feel different to to the me that I felt I was then Äô Can anyone relate,Safe/Neutral

Hi First time posting to this community Reddit in a good long while So I met my GF five months ago we started as friends but have been dating now for two months She made me aware of her diagnosis and asked me to research BPD before entering into a friendship so that I was aware of what to expect and what would be expected of me as a friend I did so and things are were have been great For the most part Issues arise between us when something I perceive to be minor is bought up As an example I recently bought up the subject of her cigarette consumption which I have noted lately has been quite high I was merely commenting upon it and was curious as to how many she went through a day lately She rapidly became incredibly upset and pointed out my own tendency to drink several cans of coke per workday The conversation became about this with me eventually promising to drink less coke with the question about smoking forgotten My question for yourselves is how might I address that I was not attacking her She has told me that it felt like I was and she disliked being shamed and therefore felt like she needed to point out something unhealthy I did to win She chose to word it as winning which confused me as clearly she identified it as an argument that required winning whereas I did not see this as the case at all I have tried to address this with her however it is proving quite difficult I will state that I need her to dial it back a little and not take these things so heavily Her only reply to this was that I knew what I was getting into as she informed me of her diagnosis and it is therefore my responsibility to figure out ways to navigate this She feels that asking her to change her behaviour is me not being accepting of her Any advice would be much appreciated Apologies for the lengthy post,Safe/Neutral

I finally was able to get a referral from a GP to see a psychiatrist I ve done a lot of research and thinking over the past year and I m almost positive I have BPD but I feel like I need a professional s definitive opinion on whether or not it seems likely that I do in order to start seeking treatment I get you don t need a formal diagnosis to do DBT therapy or whatever but it would make me comfortable and I ve also reached a point where I think medication would be helpful I m about to schedule an appointment but I m not sure if it would be better to explicitly state to the psychiatrist that I think I have BPD or if I should just list my symptoms and hope they make the connection themselves I have comorbid autism so I m worried if I just list my symptoms which match basically all of the BPD criteria to a T they ll either think its depression bipolar something else acting with my autism or worse that I ve just memorised the list of BPD symptoms in hopes of engineering the diagnosis I want Alternatively if I outright state at the beginning of the session that I specifically think I have BPD and want to focus on that I m worried the psychiatrist will not take me seriously from my experience being diagnosed with autism doctors don t always react great if they think you ve self diagnosed already Is there some middle ground I can take to inform the psychiatrist that it s specifically BPD I m concerned about while not making it seem necessarily like I m actively trying to get that diagnosis I m 19 in college and this is the first time I m trying to be proactive about my health without any aid from my parents so any advice about this situation process would be super appreciated thanks yall,Safe/Neutral

I m expecting to get a lot of push back for this but I m ok with that This is probably the easiest part of BPD to deal with I do not understand why it appears that so many don t stop the repeating cycles of explosive verbal abuse I fully understand that it s not easy in fact it s damn right difficult and knowing it can always come back to roar its ugly head can be demoralizing It takes sitting down with yourself and being honest about what your triggers are Who cares how weird they might sound to others What is something that when said to you just flips that switch What are things that people do that cause you to blow up Figure it out and tell the people in your life what they are Be open that you suffer from cognitive distortions you need to tell people if I start acting this way it s because my BPD has made me think this instead and I need you to help me stop the train before it goes off the tracks Tell them the best ways to calm you down What you need to hear to slow the spiral down If you stop the verbal onslaught before it happens or at least lessen it it makes every relationship so much easier to deal with Life becomes easier I think though it s because I never see anyone talk about how cognitive distortions are a major factor of BPD Of course you ll fly off the handle at ridiculous things if you re perceiving a situation incorrectly I mean hell DBT is basically CBT with mindfulness added in The verbal abuse though is the easiest to stop because you can have others stop you and say hey I think you re perception of what I said isn t correct so you get a way to check yourself It s even better when you stop and ask people is this what you meant because this is the way I took it I m sure a lot of people will disagree with me about this and that s fine I hope that somebody sees this and just is able to have it click and help them work through it Because once I got used to stopping and asking if I m taking things wrong and having people stop me before I derail life got so much easier to cope with,Safe/Neutral

Why is it that wherever I go around finding resources and support on how to cope with FPs it s always either romanticising the FP relationship as omg extreme crushy dopamine obsession expecting the FP to fulfil all your BPD needs being genuinely toxic as hell towards them because surprise what we have is a DISORDER and then calling them ableist for daring to speak up about it like it s a normal thing with BPD which ventures into anti recovery territory I find it genuinely disturbing honestly FPs are at their core a trauma reenactment response They form because subconsciously that person reminds you of a past caretaker or abuser whose treatment of you as a child caused you to develop BPD to begin with I theorise it s almost the brain s way of gaining control over past trauma or recreating past scenarios as it s what it subconsciously knows and grew to cope with Maybe they are nice to you in a way you wish your past caretakers could have been or maybe they re dismissive because they re busy and then give you a lot of attention when they do have the time They re most likely not abusive like your former caretakers but unfortunately your brain gets hooked That s why we split on them If they were normal healthy things we wouldn t freaking split on them I hate how there s so many how to create a healthy FP relationship posts too I feel like that term is a contradiction in itself because an FP relationship is never going to be inherently healthy if the root cause is a trauma reenactment bond If it s healthy then well it s not an FP anymore Long textpost not sure about flair either but I m just disturbed by the lack of research on what causes FPs and the blatant disregard for their roots aka trauma that should be healed,Safe/Neutral

28m Does anyone else not give a shit about people unless they see them in person regularly When I was younger I had a huge group of friends that I would hangout with all the time Literally everyday I spent with a group or a person barely any alone time and I LOVED it However as I Äôve gotten older and moved around I have lost a lot of those relationships and I am really struggling to find new ones I basically do everything alone now I am still pretty active but I am so tired all the time I feel like used to get a social Äúhigh Äù from interacting with people but now it Äôs like I Äôm constantly just exhausted and I could easily just go straight to sleep after work I built a lot of those relationships in high school and a job I had previously which was very lax and had a ton of people in the same age range The job I have now pays a lot better and I actually have health benefits but the social aspect is much worse and the job itself is much stricter so I don Äôt even really WANT to befriend my coworkers for fear of stuff coming back to me at my job This just fucking sucks I feel so alone all the time,Emotional Distress
My fp hasn Äôt spoke to me for 2 3 weeks It Äôs a rlly hard one to explain but I rlly need some help or advice so please stick with it For context Had a big split on my fp 3 weeks ago bc they told me they prob wouldn Äôt be able to come and visit me for the week We had planned this months ago as a way to know for definite when we Äôd see eachother next when we moved away from eachother end of may The reasons for not being able to come were outside of both of our controls but I still snapped as I Äôd basically been using that visit as the only thing to hold on to and keep me going They told me they Äôd let me know for definite on a certain date A week later and a few days past that date they hadn Äôt told me anything and eventually have me a short answer of ÄòI can Äôt come been too busy to look at all the messages Äô And I Äôve heard nothing since That was two weeks ago I Äôve been busy before but I Äôve never not had enough time to send a very short text Anyway I kinda split again but very quickly snapped out of it and sent a lot of messages apologising n explaining my actions I know that I am still responsible for my actions and I wasn Äôt trying to excuse them but to give context to them I Äôve heard nothing since and I Äôve sent a few messages in between but I Äôm very conscious of it seeming like I Äôm harassing them so I Äôve kept it minimal I also know that my fp has a tendency to isolate from everyone apart from their best mate when they Äôre rlly depressed and so I could just not be hearing from them bc of that but I can Äôt stop spiralling that this is all my fault All I want is an answer on wether they Äôre done with me and if that Äôs the case I Äôll deal with that I Äôve text them tonight to ask that and as of yet no response It sucks a lot bc they Äôre one of my best mates they know abt my mental health and have been one of the most supportive friends I Äôve had and we were like ridiculously close mates up until this I Äôm hoping they just need space and that we can talk about it soon I know I Äôve done things wrong and mill accept the consequences of my actions I just wanna know if I Äôm being unreasonable to want an answer on if their done with me or not I Äôve felt like I Äôve been going insane the last few weeks with guilt and shame and anger and sadness and even if they are done with me at least knowing would make this pain justified,Emotional Distress
I 24f really miss my ex 25m who has bpd At the time we were together I didn Äôt know he had it but because of how we broke up and in the months since I explored my suspicions and did a lot of reading up and have come to understand it a lot more I really miss him but because he was the one to break up with me and subsequently block me on everything I no longer have any ways of contacting him that won Äôt be classed as stalking and I don Äôt want to smother him I wished him a happy birthday on fb but he just left me on read and blocked me I understand he must be feeling like rubbish either cuz he Äôs still splitting on me and doesn Äôt want anything to do with me or because he feels I deserve better but I don Äôt want anyone else but him I have nowhere else to turn because everyone tells me he Äôs no good for me even though he never abused me and I have never felt this way about anyone else before His former friends have cut him off and I know he Äôs found a new few people but I think he thinks I turned his former friend against him I actually wanted them to stay friends so we could still all hang out I really appreciate the insight this sub gives and I would really appreciate any advice on this because I don Äôt want to lose him,Emotional Distress

Specifically because of a very crappy but long term relationship I can t deny that part of it is because we trauma bonded and I can t imagine trying to ever bond with anyone else I feel like nobody else ever could or will get me But honestly i probably would be able to if I wasn t so ugly due to my own doing overweight bad skin bad hygiene all fixable just difficult due to good ol crippling depression I don t want to leave but I can t deny that if I was less depressed working meeting new people developing my hobbies lost weight again so looked better better wardrobe all things I have identified and am slowly but surely working on I would be far more inclined to Or maybe even then I would still be attached I just hate everything because of this relationship but I can t imagine ever being with anyone else even most friendships just didn t matter to me anymore for a long time I also am doing this alone because I could never trust a therapist enough and I have issues with authority TLDR sorry for incoherent rambling but man codependency sucks,Emotional Distress
recently i have started to develop the most debilitating paranoia i have ever experienced mainly centered around being paranoid that people are dead almost completely at random my boyfriend is my FP and recently he has been going out much more often than he used to with his friends i Äôm already paranoid about his friends in the first place because he does not usually reply quickly when he Äôs with them but recently that has turned into panic attack level breakdowns about doubting his safety for example if he goes out to the mall and doesn Äôt reply for more than an hour i immediately start uncontrollably sobbing and have at that point full on convinced myself he is dead or that something terrible has happened by the hour and a half mark i will have sent probably 200 imessages and tried to call at least 15 times i have desperately googled any accidents or tragedies in his area i can not calm down until he comes back i Äôve been putting forth absolutely all of my energy into refraining from doing this but it never works i feel so bad it Äôs worse when his phone dies or even when he sleeps in a little late i have sat there staring waiting for the delivered thing on imessage to move down for hours i can Äôt focus on anything else i don Äôt want to pin this on our relationship being unhealthy either because it Äôs honestly the strongest relationship i Äôve ever had and he agrees in terms of himself though the paranoia is mainly focused on him because he Äôs my FP it Äôs with my family too lack of response sends me into panic attacks for almost everyone about their safety i have to walk into my moms room at least twice every night to make sure she Äôs just sleeping and not dead i have traits of OCD so that part may be part of a compulsion but either way it Äôs still incredibly distressing i have not gone a day without having at least two panic attacks for the last week nothing helps until my body can Äôt handle it anymore and passes out for the night due to stress the only advice i have managed to receive is the basic Äúremind yourself that these thoughts aren Äôt rational build communication Äù advice but it just doesn Äôt work the severity of this is far too much for anything like that to even begin to graze the mindset i Äôm in when this happens i don Äôt know what to do does anyone else experience this,Emotional Distress
So when I was younger I always went through these moments of being hypersexual more often I was hypersexual than I wasn t But I always had a situation that made me be like this fight with parents no money I got kicked out at 18 and didn t know how to live by myself so made a whole ton of risky decisions until I was about 20 and I felt like I had calmed down After that came 2 years of inner calmth but also depression but my depression to the outside world and even to myself looked way more peaceful then I was used to so I didn t recognize it until now couple if months later Content warning mentioning of sexually explicit photos and sex So a month ago I felt really good suddenly and I wanted to have fun and go out again so I downloaded tinder and matched a man twice my age we saw each other a couple of times and he was kind etc but then he became a bit obsessed so I ended it After I ended it I felt really bored since I rediscovered sex with him and here it comes I sent my nudes with consent and without face to literally at least 100 stranger men online I don t know what triggered this behaviour and why it went on for a month I m feeling not too great at this moment and would really love advice on how to prevent this and what to do if or when also hypersexuzlity and depression is what I struggle with the most so if anyone here who has the same have some tips for me it s very welcome Also english isn t my native language sorry for mistakes,Emotional Distress

Is there an online test tool you could use in testing your reflective functioning mentalizing capacities It Äôs been written that people with BPD hyper mentalize on ways that are harmful due to deficits in their abilities to understand their own mental states and those of others Basically hypermentalizing is Äúprocess that involves making assump tions about other people s mental states that go so far beyond observable data that others may struggle to see how they are justified Äù https uh edu class psychology clinical psych research dpl publications _files Sharp_Vanwoerden_2015 pdf I Äôve looked for the reflective functioning questionnaire RFQ but I Äôm not sure how the scores can be put into context or averaged I Äôm trying to do away with the hypervigilance the constant needs for validation and reassurance and I get that the mentalizing and poor primitive constructs of my experiences and those of others are definitely at play here in the issues I Äôve had in my life,Emotional Distress

My first post and second language so sorry in advance I 22f was diagnosed with bpd after a prison sentecing in 2018 I used my time since then to gratuate the equivient of highschool and raising my dog I tried cutting out the people who were toxic and working on my self while going through different psyco thearaputic like appointments classes and stuff My family and I are no longer on speaking terms I have zero close friends or long time relations and no boyfriend or favorite person for the first time ever and I feel the loneliness and emptiness everyday since finishing school and not really doing anything besides smoking weed and drinking to numb the lonelines I put myself out there despite my ptsd and fear of rejectment but always tend to seem standoffish or overshare and the continue to overthink and feel ashamed for said oversharing Those new people I have met always give of good vibes but I am trying to find friends and I am usually the only one to intigate contact and I have trouble differentiating wether I am overthinking and maybe trying too hard or that these people are just not the right friends for me and that they are just politely tolerating me I hope I make sense and that some of you wonderful internet people will give your experience and wisdom thanks,Emotional Distress
For the people who have been in long term relationships have you had any success after your partner grows tired For more information we ve been married for a little over 5 years For most of it I wasn t diagnosed Now that I am I m starting to notice every way I ve affected our relationship but mostly how it has affected my partner For example he doesn t go anywhere to avoid a reaction He doesn t talk to many people to avoid a reaction I ve actually made a lot of progress so far no where near perfect and I mess up sometimes I want him to enjoy things I want him to have friends and be happy I absolutely do not want him to feel like he has to walk on eggshells I love him and I don t want to hurt him any longer But I can tell he s tired absolutely drained He lives the same day every day because anything out of routine may set me off I hate it I know he loves me but he isn t happy And he won t leave me And maybe I m being selfish by not doing it for him Because I want this I want him and our forever So if I keep doing the work can this work How can I show him that things can be different I urge him to make plans But he still won t because it ll be more trouble than it s worth It feels like he s not giving me the chance to be better I know I can though,Emotional Distress

Unfortunately due to poor past relationships I now see all interactions in the form of a power play And I want to win because when I am winning I feel loved and safe and like the rug isn t about to get pulled out from under me However I feel like my BPD is a handicap in that regard I forever feel like I am too much like I have to filter out these strong intense feelings or they will overwhelm other people and make them lose interest in me My go to for years has to been to try not to show emotions to other people at all because I think I look weak when I do My new person is LESS overly anxious obviously needy than my last one He is a little harder to win with I am obviously so excited about him new person and want to gush all over the place but I know that other people do not find that attractive My new person is online It is what it is When we are together on voice I think I am clearly the stronger personality I am more direct than he is more opinionated more to the point He seems charmed by that the confidence I mean Over voice I am the boss lady and he seems quite enamored with me and says very vulnerable things But with time and distance text messaging I soften my insecurities come out and my more gushy emotional side just pours out and it makes me deeply uncomfortable In those times I think he holds more power I ve been trying SO hard to look chill and unaffected and secure and not to act on insecurities but now I realize that in being so unaffected and considerate I might be having the opposite effect Like maybe I look too complacent Like sure do whatever you want I m cool with it I ll just be right here waiting Take your time And that to me is HORRIBLE I don t know how to find balance I just oscillate wildly between being too soft sweet and gushy to being too chilly too bossy and icy How do other people accomplish balance between these feelings,Emotional Distress
I always ask people for insight on how I treat them and how they perceive me I always make myself very aware of my behavior and surroundings because I Äôm always worried I Äôm doing something wrong Anyways I was talking to a friend ex lover last night and asked her why she thinks people only see me as a temporary thing She said that I seem aloof and Äúfree spirited Äù and that people are probably just afraid that they will tie me down I want to be tied down though All I want is a solid relationship and I Äôve worked so hard to better myself and be a more reliable person I Äôve come so far and the people who Äôve stuck around love them tell me that I Äôm doing much better I know I can love and be loved properly now more than ever before but I Äôm not really ever given the chance I just don Äôt understand how people can tell me that I Äôm special or that I Äúfeel like a breath of fresh air Äù and then leave Do people just see me as a stepping off point I don Äôt know I just know that I don Äôt want to come off as Äúfree spirited Äù anymore I Äôm tired of scaring people away Is this a shared feeling How do I change,Emotional Distress
I told my partner I Äôm struggling with feelings of jealousy which I know are irrational but they are distressing for me and I Äôm trying to get to the bottom of them I think it links into the fear of abandonment and disrespect in the past he has acted like I Äôm barely there or disrespected me in front of his friends but we are meant to be leaving all that behind and trying to start afresh After we broke up he did really well making new friends and he spends most of his free time with them now I ran off travelling for 3 months Im feeling like I would rather see him than other people and perhaps I Äôm in too deep too quick as we were meant to be taking it slow but he also wants to see me when he has the time it Äôs just not enough for me He gets defensive and says it Äôs my shit to deal with which it is and I said that myself I will be speaking more with my therapist about it too Just wondering if anybody else has maybe navigated this better than me or has had a more constructive conversation because I Äôm left feeling over emotional and manipulative as usual,Emotional Distress
So for as long as I could remember I Äôve always hated going out Even as a child Growing up it was mostly because of my intense fear of getting lost in crowded places but not that I Äôm 21 it Äôs more to do with other factors I honestly hate how our society works I hate how going to the mall means that men are going to stare at females and give them looks I hate it It makes me so uncomfortable feeling like I Äôm objectified whenever I leave the house Being part of the LGBT community also makes this more difficult as I Äôll have to hide my sense of style to fit into the societal norms where I live Also my family are totally against my sexuality so it makes it even harder Overall I HATE going out I Äôd much rather be alone chilling otp w my gf Is it normal,Emotional Distress
I had heard a while back that the manifestation of symptoms of people diagnosed with borderline personality disorder can sometimes change with age especially within their 30s and 40s I Äôm in my late 30s and have noticed that my anger and irritability has really increased since my late 20s early 30s I can literally feel myself about to punch a wall if something minor happens even non person related such as my vacuum cleaner won Äôt pick something up or something not working for me and so making me invest more energy or time into something when I want to get on with the day I Äôm constantly on the verge of losing it over the stupidest things that I recognize are minor set backs Also I find myself pretty much annoyed with everyone Like all the time Whereas I was never much of a people person I didn Äôt get annoyed simply being in a crowd of people at a food store for example But within the past couple years it Äôs like just hearing other people talk sometimes can be enough to set me off even if it Äôs nothing negative towards me or even towards me at all Has anyone else experienced this Could it be from an accumulation of disappointments and letdowns by people my entire life mother was BPD covert NPD nightmare and I really fly off the handle with her easier than ever too to the point where just seeing another human puts me on edge It Äôs like a default misttust and dislike of all people until unless I talk one n one with them and find them to be Äònice Äô manifestation of splitting but of course if they then let me down it Äôs back to ÄòOh I should Äôve known better just another piece of crap person Äô Funny side note i jokingly say say that when i geT angry about even something minor I feel like those Warner Brothers cartoons when a hammer hits the cartoons foot and the temperature gauge goes from 0 to 100 and bursts at the top lol Anyone relate Would love to hear others Äô thoughts and experiences,Emotional Distress

I am a 22 year old female Since I was old enough to date I have had a serious boyfriend Long term relationships As soon as I break up it doesn Äôt even last a month before I Äôm seeing and basically moved in with someone else This isn Äôt exactly the issue Äî The problem is when I imagine my ideal self it Äôs someone who is completely different than who I am I imagine a version of myself who lives alone in her own place does what she wants and answers to whomever on her own time decorated the way she wants hangs around who she wants when she wants etc I mourn the girl who could Äôve moved out of state and done what she wanted instead of sticking around my hometown There are obviously several other Äúwhat if Ä Äù versions of myself whom I think I could Äôve been Unfortunately i never gave these versions of myself a chance to exist and I am in a relationship that is pretty complacent and satisfying at this point so I am mourning the versions of myself that never occurred I have molded myself so much to the characteristics of everyone around me and I never gave myself the chance to grow into limitless possibilities because I chose to avoid the unknown and stick to what was comfortable Sorry for the rant I just needed to admit that I am grieving for the person s I never will because of my inability to be alone,Emotional Distress
I recently decided to drop one of my majors in college dance This thing had really been boosting my ego and I love it I also dedicated my ig to my performances and stuff I wanted to be an dancer for these reasons I was being really obnoxious about it around my friends saying my teachers were annoying and didn Äôt know what they were talking about Then I had a break down and went to the mental hospital When I got out I told my friends I didn Äôt want to be a dancer anymore bc it was too much pressure to always be watched and judged and I was sad about dropping the major I always felt like my friends thought I was annoying for thinking I could make it as an dancer Complaining to them about dropping out of school just felt like my attempt to get them to see how much it meant to me and get their sympathy even though I know they don Äôt really care It felt kind of manipulative What do you guys think Vulnerable narcissism I just got diagnosed with bpd and feel like I Äôm constantly bringing my hurt feelings into social situations not like you hurt me more like this other person hurt me or I Äôm so annoyed with this person or at this or trying to relate to others when they feel down I feel like I Äôm always changing myself for others constantly Now I feel like I was lying saying I didn Äôt want to dance anymore bc I Äôm looking at going into dance therapy I Äôm feeling a lot of shame right now for trying to get sympathy for my situation and being so arrogant and narcissistic in the first place,Emotional Distress
My FP is my therapist and it seems every time I go into a session my mood dips greatly It used to happen with other FPs I had too As a child it was my teacher and I always got really low around him and we d end up speaking about my struggles and I d be feeling so low It s happened with every FP I ve ever had I ve always ended up dropping hints to show I m struggling I don t know if it s something I do to seek comfort or approval or for attention or what Is it me trying to get them to react to me Is it a need to seem sicker around them I don t fully understand why I m doing this but I can t stop it and I can t notice when I m doing it until after Does anyone else get this and understand why it is,Emotional Distress
DAE ever feel like this Is this typical BPD behavior I always thought it was my abandonment issues that I was always jealous if my husband gave attention to another woman esp if attractive but now I Äôm noticing it goes beyond that I find myself getting jealous and irritable if he gives a lot of attention to his parents even like I get very aggravated if I feel they ask more from him than they should even though they Äôre elderly and then he will go and do it for them I end up feeling like he is Äúchoosing Äúthem over me even though technically I don Äôt need anything from him at the time A lot of resentment has built bc ive asked him to tell th em Äòno Äô sometimes and he never does bc he says they Äòneed Äô him For some reason this is extremely triggering to me Also even more ridiculous getting super aggravated if I Äôm trying to talk to him about something and he is fiddling on his phone or watching a tv commercial I will yell at him what Äôs so interesting sbout this damn commercial I get so annoyed So I Äôm starting to realize it has nothing to do with attention he gives romantically but actually any kind of attention that has taken off of me I get resentful about Tv parents or even sometimes work calling that he stops listening to me for etc Furthermore I really think this is a pattern from childhood bc when this occurs I do the same to family members I get extremely aggravated and jealous of my mother for example tells me she can Äôt talk about something right now because she have to go tend to her grandkids who is a three month old I immediately get upset like I Äôm your daughter I come first I recognize a baby has more pressing needs but her telling me she doesn Äôt have time for me is extremely triggering Even as a child I would get extremely resentful toward my 8 12 year younger siblings if my mom left me to tend to them or even allowed them to ask her for something while I was talking to her In short any distraction but especially another person who takes attention away from me esoecislly when I really need to tslk to them about something raises my irritability through the roof and I CANNOT handle it DAE experience this,Emotional Distress
This isn t the usual thing in relationships I experience This is different My ex and I broke up a while ago but all through the relationship and even now I think about his twin sister I don t like his sister I never have I tried to like her by going places with her and talking to her And she s okay but she rubs me the wrong way I just don t like her I feel like I m always trying to prove myself to her I ve recently started talking to my ex again as friends and it s making me think about her more Is this something different or could this be related to bpd I really don t want to think about her all the time I haven t even talked to her in a year and I never see her except for the rare run in at the gym I ve blocked her on social media to help with it so I can t look her up either It feels like something out of my control I can t help but want to know what she s doing What is going on,Emotional Distress
I liked him because he was different Right before my rediagnosis for bpd and a few months ago and finding this subreddit I actually told this person he was my favorite person I genuinely meant it To my fucking horror when I came here and realized what this actually meant He is a narcissist and took advantage of me mentally and emotionally He admitted this to me I feel like he s watching all the time Even here I know its silly My ocd ptsd won t let it go I have multiple people that know and have witnessed his behavior towards me I made very fucking AWFUL mistakes and judgements For years I could not FOR THE LIFE OF ME figure out WHY I was doing this Damn it all clicked It just hit me and I had to sit and think about it for a long ass time I finally was able to let it go He is still not over it He is blocked on everything I ve had to sever friendships leave communities and hide from this guy because he can t respect boundaries when I say its over this time Im changing my IP making a new account keeping the friends closest to me and just moving the fuck on It feels great My mind is free just because I understand and want to change and correct my behavior I ll probably delete this post I guess I m writing this as a form of therapy to release some anxiety Mini Victory for me üèÖ,Emotional Distress
I would like some insight into how others take the meaning of words like friend I m a literalist if a word is used I will generally stick the traditional definition of the work because I believe that is the common belief around it I understand words sometimes have double meanings and slang usage but I stick to traditional definitions as slang usage has gotten me into trouble before I recently found out that words don t quite mean the same thing to everyone like the word friend When someone says I m their friend that makes me legit happy I feel like we can share our feelings and secrets with each other and be like the stories you read in grade school of characters being best of friends Staying in constant contact and being there for each other In reality it seems friend to some people just means you re good in my book and nothing more If that s the case why not just say X I like you you re good in my book I m feeling torn because if someone calls me a friend and I like them I m learning that maybe they don t mean friend the way I would use it If that is true then what is the point of words in terms of relations to people Why even bother I feel like you really don t ever truly know someone which makes me distrustful of people but this thing I m noticing about words not meaning the same thing is really troubling,Emotional Distress
This is my first time posting in this subreddit so I apologize if this isn t organized or anything I recently learned 2021 that I struggle with BPD I struggled admitting to myself any of the pain or the true debilitating nature of my BPD and especially the ways it affects me about romance I am not ready for romantic love which is not to say I don t deserve it hard to think I do after this but I am not ready and I m willing to admit that now which I wasn t before I don t think there was a way for me to ever be ready for a relationship I am 22 years old and I recognize I have full responsibilities for my actions even if my intentions are different from my actions but I do not have any of the emotional skills a 22 year old should have I feel like a child emotionally developmentally speaking I don t know if that is common but it s the way I feel However this conclusion only came to me after a time of crisis I cheated on this person we were not officially dating however we were committed to each other and it was completely my idea to do so and I spent a lot of effort to break down their walls because I genuinely thought and had the intention that I could be the best person possible for them but I could not be that without helping myself My childhood wasn t great my dad used to be addicted to drugs before I was born and was is an active alcoholic I recognize the ways me and my dad are similar but he refused to get help for himself at any point He s now 60 yo my mother has put up with my dad s abuse the entire time they ve been married it took me until this week to realize the way my dad treats my mom isn t how any person deserves to be treated However my view of love is poisoned because I never got love or felt it from people it was supposed to come from My dad abused me when I was younger and still continues to emotionally abuse me and did not have any skills to pass onto me to cope with any traumas or illnesses or anything Besides that though I was SA d multiple times when I was a child from a really early age between 8 11 I literally cannot remember when it occurred to me at all which I think was a survival response from my brain I wish my brain could ve just completely blanked out that that happened but I can t Every time that I should ve gotten love from my family I wasn t met with love and I don t think it s out of genuine want to hurt me or anything just I recognize I don t think my parents should have had me because the conditions I was raised in weren t conductive to me having a healthy mental state unless I was getting support from a young age which I didn t I also was groomed on the internet many many times from childhood all the way throughout all of highschool I fed off the attention of disgusting people because I felt like that is what I deserved and talking to those people was some of the only forms of attention I was getting as a child My intention in telling the above information is not to ask for pity regardless of how I was treated I shouldn t have treated this person this way if I truly loved them because you do not cheat on a person you love But I couldn t even love them they were the first person to provide me true genuine love and I couldn t do anything but reject it Almost every romantic situation beyond this one went bad for me I have terrible taste in people and I ve continually met people who met me with more trauma I was always the second option in every situation and I ve been cheated on in every situation which would make me think since it happened to me I would never do it to someone else but I did it to them They have expressed that they want to be with me like it is a genuine want in their brain however they cannot be with me and I understand that now during a 3 hour phone conversation last night I didn t understand this at all and was just begging for them to stay over and over They want to be with me that s what their brain wants however the conclusion they ve come to every time is that they cannot be with me because their paranoia won t allow them to I am willing to put in all of the work that is required to help them heal from that because I am not capable of hurting them in that way anymore I know some may not believe me but I can only admit that now knowing I was capable of hurting them before because I had terrible coping mechanisms to deal with that They told me to move on they told me I needed space from them so I could move on but my brain feels a genuine need to fix this relationship if it s possible and I am just wondering if it s able to be fixed I want to love them and think I can be a genuine loving and healthy partner for them I just needed therapy in order to process all of my traumas I don t think I am saying something wrong in saying that but regardless of how I feel now and my desire to be a better person the overwhelming thought in their brain is me hurting them and I just don t know if I can ever fix that So I am asking for perspective I apologize for this being really really long but for anyone who reads all of this even if you don t offer advice thank you,Emotional Distress
Hey y Äôall strong people I Äôm really at my wits Äô end and I would like to hear about your perspectives and experiences what seems to be working for you and what didn Äôt work Do you do CBT DBT or another kind of therapy Also do you take any meds on the side to help regulate your mood or manage some of the symptoms If yes I Äôd like to hear about them too I Äôm really interested to hear about your therapy approaches,Emotional Distress
A few weeks ago yes I m still thinking of it my friend had jokingly told me I had no friends when I mentioned something about one of my irl friends It hurt me but you know I registered it was a joke to him so I didn t comment on it I have never been an open person nor have I ever really had a deep ish connection except with another friend I had who in my opinion has BPD and she did use to agree but she s gone really radical and doesn t even believe it exists but that s unrelated Like I said before I am not emotionally open not to my family and especially not to my friends I don t know why and I can t think of any underlying cause I cannot make deep connections I hate texting and calling my real life friends the only people I enjoy texting are my online friends and maybe it comes from the fact I never really texted real life people when I was younger so it s super awkward I have been on the internet since I was like 7 and I m almost 15 right now so I don t like having my irl friends in my online life and only enjoying seeing them irl and nowhere else Online all my friends are simply my friends if I m close to you then I talk to you but that s all we do We talk I have never had a meaningful romantic relationship and am probably aromantic so even more reasons why I m an antisocial freak but I wish I could connect to people I want deep relationships I want to be emotional openly I want to feel normal,Emotional Distress
I haven t seen my very close friend for about a month now and i couldn t see her a couple of days ago because i was simply unable to function Now she s invited me to this party but there is no way i can attend since these kind of gatherings with a bunch of strangers tend to trigger panic attacks in me and just generally ramp up my anxiety to an extreme level She is undestandaly upset but she is accusing me of lying to her and manipulating her i went to a social gathering last saturday but there were only very close friends present and it was a very different safe kind of atmosphere I offered her to meet any other time and place and tried to explain why i can t attend the party but she is still convinced im lying about my emotional volatility and that im just being an asshole I don t know what to tell her and it s making me hate myself please offer advice if you can,Emotional Distress
I could come up with a dozen theories as to why I think I do I had an abusive mother and a near non existent relationship with my father My childhood was filled with verbal and physical abusive and chaos I Äôve witnessed intense and terrifying anger outbursts from my mom growing up and I became genuinely afraid of her I didn Äôt feel safe at home nor did I feel loved I was sexually assaulted by my cousin When I reached my adolescence I started looking for interaction outside of the family but I couldn Äôt form or maintain friendships I didn Äôt have friends until highschool I made friends who I didn Äôt have anything in common with and then I made other friends who I did The first time I ever told anyone ÄúI love you Äù was with them at the age of 17 I suffocated them I pulled back before I could really push them away I even tried leaving but they stuck around and even stayed by my side despite me dissipating constantly 9 years later and they Äôre my best friends Now I Äôm healthier I have a good healthy relationship with my family and my friends But during that time I where I felt abandoned by friends and family I looked for love in girls And ever since it Äôs been addicting I Äôm not the most handsome guy but I guess I Äôve had my share of flings But it Äôs never enough I Äôm not handsome enough to always have a girl available to validated me in any way So the search for any girl to pay attention to me is just terrible And I know it Äôs bad to think and behave the way I do But I can Äôt help it I want to be loved I want to be desired I want to feel like I Äôm worth it I want to never feel rejected or unworthy but that Äôs all dating is for me And I Äôve tried going to therapy and working out and doing everything I can to be grateful for what I have instead of what I don Äôt have But for some reason I just want women Äôs approval attention validation and comfort There is no other point to my life I want to feel loved,Emotional Distress

For the last year I Äôve really felt like myself again Like I was before I think my BPD developed I haven Äôt officially been diagnosed but I read about it a lot and a lot of it resonates with me I had an incident of minor bullying at work a few months back and as a result I feel like everything came spiraling down and I was back to square one where all the symptoms came back Can bad experiences trigger BPD to return,Emotional Distress
so it s been a while since i started thinking people tend to treat me differently because im an undiagnosed borderline been in therapy for two years ive done every kind of DSM 5 test n shit but psychologists and psychiatrists here are reluctant to give a diagnosis less than one year ago my dad died of cancer and since i have a way older sister e too many problems with my bipolar mom i decided to live with my sister who has two daughters that are basically my age anyways me and my nieces are very different im a very calm person and i always try to keep it cool even when we re having a big fight on the contrary they don t see any problem in shouting and screaming all the way around lately i started noticing that my sister is always kind of sweet with me and when we talk about my mental health she always makes sure to make me know that since im a borderline im a disabled person which honestly kinda pisses me off like i know i have a ton of problems due to my disorder but why do people treat you like you re dumb sometimes i really feel like my friends and family see me as a poor kid kinda disappointing just wanna know if this ever happened to you p s sorry for my bad english but it s been a rough year and i kinda lost my decent vocabulary,Emotional Distress
Does anyone else gets delayed emotional responses i know that most people get upset at the moment but I won Äôt know how upset I am I may feel that I Äôm a little upset but the real emotional response will come later and sometimes I won Äôt know I Äôm even upset till the time passes than I will get floated by all the emotions out of nowhere yesterday I was opening up to my mom and she answered really dry answers with tiredness and no desire I asked why she answers like that and she said it Äôs tiring because I always talk and Äò Äôwhine Äô Äô about the same i was a little surprised and weirded out by her answer than she told me she feels like she is too tired herself to deal with other peoples emotions I asked her what bothers her and we talked about it I felt really bad for her being so overwhelmed and I saw her struggles I realized that maybe she doesn Äôt see me because I never tried to see her as well and when she tried to tell or hint me I didn Äôt care that much we both ended this conversation on a really positive note and I went to sleep satisfied Today when I came back home after finishing my daily plans it was suddenly hitting me I felt a lump in my throat and started to cry I felt mad and angry and I asked myself Äò Äôwhy Why she never tried to see me I Äôm her child why she didn Äôt give me this place Why she didn Äôt give my feelings a room why I always have to feel so pathetic when trying to talk about what bothers me Äô Äô Now Im extremely annoyed by her presence I don Äôt want to speak to her or her or to see her she asked me what happened when she saw me crying I didn Äôt want to open it up so I said Äò ÄôI Äôm just tired Äô Äô and with zero empathy she told me Äò Äôand you think Im not tired Äô Äô After I was listening her for hours yesterday,Emotional Distress

Quote from the 2019 Joker kinda cringe ik But I feel that shit in my soul Encapsulates BPD in particular especially well imo I just wish people at least tried understand how it feels to have this It can hurt so much sometimes when the people you care about most don t recognize how hard it is to live like this and how much a little bit of patience would be appreciated,Emotional Distress
Words cannot describe how terrified I am right now After breaking up with me two days ago my favourite person is thinking of not contacting me anymore I say a lot of stupid shit when I Äôm angry and lashed at him which made him second guess keeping me in his life I need help I know I do If he leaves what do I do How do I detach myself from him If he leaves I lose all of my friends because they Äôre also his I have no friends at school no one to game with and I Äôm not good at making new friends I once again really need help,Emotional Distress
im 19 I have 2 friends but they Äôre more like acquaintances They talk to me very periodically And I kind of avoid reaching out bc I don Äôt feel I have a lot to offer and i get so much paranoia I have a very chaotic life including a year or two of psychosis so that definitely does not help Im just super paranoid bc the last person close to me my ex destroyed me and brought me to rock bottom I just don Äôt do much now I spend pretty much every day at home alone watching tv tic tok or researching bpd which is helpful but also causes me so much stress I never really was the type to make friends so I don Äôt even know where to begin I know I have a side of me that is super determined and interested in a lot of stuff But I just realized that about myself I guess I always thought I was just lazy and worthless So now Im trying to figure out how to live instead of just survive if that makes sense,Emotional Distress

Hi everyone I wanted to come here to see if people feel the same as me with relationships Does anybody else get this overwhelming feeling with people like feeling completely attached to them and angry when they don Äôt react to you in the way you wanted them to I am really struggling with this at the moment and I wanted to see if anybody feels the same as me I hope I don Äôt come across as an attention seeker or anything it Äôs just something I find really hard with having BPD Any answers to this will help and I hope you are all ok üòä,Emotional Distress
I hope it s not a problem if I share this page https medium com ThriceTraumatised which contains my story in 3 chapters The third is the borderline chapter I have experienced this total emotional instability and perception of myself by developing an intense transference for a doctor in a non therapeutic setting I would like to hear comments from more people I need it because he ghosted me absurdly and I m still in the throes of conflicting feelings I would like to read opinions on the behavior of the other despite the few details Then I add a question who says that feelings must be analyzed understood processed and put aside as a joke of the mind stay in front of a therapist for years until you fall in love with him and eventually return home aware and without having remedied any human relationship Can t you find other better ways let s say even original ones to exploit such intense feelings for therapeutic purposes it was what I was hoping for and even though it seems to have gone badly I think it didn t have to go that way I am very frustrated and discouraged as it is likely that I will not develop those strong feelings for any other man they don t reach those levels in normal relationships,Emotional Distress

Yesterday I tried initiating sex with my gf and she said she would be willing to fool around later in the day I said sure no problem and sort of went about my day I did a full clean of my house took her for lunch and then we watched Netflix and played ps5 When we got into bed she just layed on her phone and watched tik tok I started to try pulling her towards me to kiss her or caress her or something She caught on and said do you need me to help you out which I do appreciate but I was a little hurt because intimate time is something I d like to share together instead of her just pleasing me Unfortunately this is a common occurrence but last night hit me really hard for some reason I think it s because she got my hopes up by saying she would be willing to fool around later and then I was looking forward to it all day and then I was brushed off again The frequency of this makes me feel like my girlfriend isn t sexually attracted to me and that she only gets me off to keep me happy I do appreciate that but I really crave the feeling of her desiring me I want her to not be able to hold herself back the same way I feel when I see her I m in a bad way right now I Cried for 4 hours this morning Sobbed I just feel so undesired and that the intimacy is so 1 sided Idk why I m posting this I m just so hurt and feel myself splitting and I don t want to,Emotional Distress
Needing help Finding it really difficult to hold tension pain Prompting Event There was a very painful interpersonal situation that occurred months ago that caused lots of falling out in a friend group that I distanced myself from One past friend reached out to apologize which is great but it brought up other unresolved pain from this group falling out committed by another person that s gone ignored unresolved I reached out with a similar olive branch but there s no response and the ignoring behavior while responding to the other person has triggered a lot of rejection dismissal and pain My current state I was in DBT for awhile and have been recovered for quite awhile I m aware of many tips and I know that part of coping is just moving through the tension and pain and remind myself it s not the end of the world But I m in it and it s been a LONG time since I ve been triggered like this and I have no one to talk to I am at work and it literally feels like I can t focus or concentrate and could use some in the moment support Any in the moment techniques to help TIA,Emotional Distress

So long story short My boyfriend got 5 grams of free crack and locked it up in his safe I am was a recovered addict for quite some time now I begged him to do it with me and he said no so then I begged him to get it out of the house and my begging went ignored Well he left his safe key on the dresser for the last two weeks The first week I was strong but eventually it got the best of me and I dipped into the bag Well 5 days later and that bag is now practically gone How do I tell him I did it all I don Äôt really regret what I did I had a good time doing it and I know I wont go out and get more I didn Äôt get it in the first place but I Äôm nervous to how he will react I don Äôt blame him for what I did but in a way I do Is that wrong of me In a way I feel he left the key there for me maybe he was testing me My thoughts are going insane right now and I Äôve been off my medication for over a month I can tell I Äôm getting manic and that could have played a small part in things but I only did it because it was there I feel as if I stole from him though I feel guilty I wasn Äôt supposed To do it all but I couldn Äôt tell him during those days because he may have taken it away He is still asleep right now When I went into the safe this morning the bag wasn Äôt tied and i know I tied it Atleast I think I did so maybe he does already know I posted something about it on another sub and they said there is no way he doesn Äôt know I Äôm just scared to tell him I Äôm not exactly sure why but I am Any tips on how I should tell him,Emotional Distress
She Äôs not in work today and all I can think about is whether or not she Äôs left the job or swapped shifts to get away from me for being too obsessive I really miss her but I don Äôt even know her she barely replies to my messages but when she does it is the best feeling ever until she ignores me again and the dread and depressive thoughts creep in I really hope I Äôll see her again and she Äôs not quit or changed shifts just seeing her brightens up my day Maybe it would be for the best if she left so I can cut her out of my life completely so I can get over her I want to tell her she Äôs my favourite person but I don Äôt want to weird her out or anything I Äôd never hurt her and I just want to give her all the love I have to give I Äôm bursting but have nobody to give it to,Emotional Distress
last night my partner was over my apartment we dont live together yet and we were kinda just coexisting for a bit it was an alright day and i like it when we can just do our own thing but still have each others company yk so i noticed that they were calling someone on the phone and it seemed like they were enjoying the call my partner has always told me that they hate calls and would much prefer texting or irl contact every time we have called very few lol i had to ask and convince them with this knowledge i ask them who theyre calling not angrily or anything i just wanted to know they say that theyre calling their ex and that theyre reading over the old messages they sent to eachother when they were dating i go oh ok and leave the room trying to hold it together lol and now i cant stop thinking about it they left this morning and i still am thinking about it after the call they seemed fine and they gave me attention and nothing seems suspicious but my brain keeps asking what if questions or skewing something they said or wondering if they have different meanings to what they say why would they willingly call with their ex but dont enjoy calling me do they text call their ex regularly do they text call other people in general more than me do they even like me i havent done anything about these thoughts but it feels like im freaking out do i say something is my reaction justified how do i stop freaking out lol,Emotional Distress
So I THINK almost 90 sure that I have bpd now I m not self diagnosing or any of that but I ve been searching up the symptoms and noticed I ve been experiencing the symptoms for as long as around may 2021 There s always the possibility that I m wrong and its something else that I ve mistaken it for but that s the main reason I want to talk to someone because I don t know wtf is going on I am scared to talk to one of the social workers at school I have anxiety about it In my head its like What am i just supposed to go in her office and say I think i have bpd or just not even mention that and tell her the symptoms that I m experiencing What if she thinks that I m faking it What if she just blows it off as oh your growing up so your body is going through a lot of changes this is normal If it is true that I have bpd then this will pretty much be my only shot at getting the help that i need until next year when i go to a new school so I don t know what to do because i have a bad relationship with my mom i don t feel comfortable telling her about what I ve been experiencing because of the thoughts mentioned earlier and there is no one else that i trust or can talk to At the end of the day im 16 and theres really not much that i can do besides this and im just too scared to do it so i dont know maybe its all in my head,Emotional Distress
Does anyone else feel like they re lying to everyone by concealing your BPD traits thoughts I have quiet BPD and I feel like everyone thinks I m a nice passive person who couldn t hurt a fly I do think that for the most part I am a good person However in my head I get very angry jealous upset want to lash out at others or show how much pain I m in through terrible cries for help and attention I know actions are what matter most but I feel like I m just pretending to be this nice person but I secretly have these malicious intentions I know it s actually good I don t act on these traits and ruin all my relationships or hurt people I know that it s not really me it s just my illness but I feel like I m just masking who I am really am and this person who I really am is a jealous abuser,Emotional Distress
often i ll get really close to people only to start showing symptoms which usually ruins the friendship i also can t even imagine the hell that my boyfriend must live through because of me i ll start feeling as if he doesn t love me and act like a total bitch because in my mind it s justified i have been trying really hard to be a better person but it s so hard and i can t really change my brain chemistry,Emotional Distress
All the news about these shootings makes my day to day so much harder It increases my guilt because I am aware my experience is nowhere even in the same realm as what those families and survivors are going through and I feel so helpless to do anything about it My therapist tells me to just stop caring but doing that makes me feel like even more of a waste of space on this planet I donate to activist groups donate to charities donate to gofundme Äôs but I never feel like I can do enough to make a difference which deepens my cycles of hopelessness Anyone else experience this and what do you do to cope My day to day rescue meds don Äôt help when it comes to major events like this,Emotional Distress
Hello everyone My biggest struggle I Äôve had in my life is dependency and abandonment issues with romantic relationships that I have If someone doesn Äôt reply to me for hours or reply a certain way that makes me think they Äôre bothered I get very upset and feel like they Äôre going to leave me or they Äôre tired of me even if I have done nothing to cause it This is due to the fact that most people I get close to use me for personal gain amp then dump be to the side of the road like I Äôm garbage So it Äôs hard to believe that the next person won Äôt just do the same I of course don Äôt say anything to these people that I Äôm bothered because I Äôm afraid that will make them leave me also I don Äôt want to seem needy I just feel like my attachment to people is unhealthy and I don Äôt know how to fix it It can change my entire mood even if I Äôm having a really good day I get scared and concerned that they Äôre losing interest even if I am on my best behavior to try to make them stay Any advice,Emotional Distress
I am so fed up with the way mental health is treated where I live I mean I don Äôt know that there Äôs anywhere where it Äôs treated properly It Äôs such a mess Ä I Äôve been trying to figure out if I have bpd or not and finally got to see a psychiatrist for a one time hour long appointment and by the end of it I was like Äúokay so do you think I have bpd Äù and she was like ÄúI mean you have a lot of the symptoms of bpd but I don Äôt want to say that you have it it has a lot of negative connotations I forget exactly what she said but essentially she said something along the lines of I have a bit of control and self awareness over the symptoms to an extent like it felt like since I Äôm not outwardly acting shitty she doesn Äôt want to say I have it because it feels like she feels like diagnosing me is saying I Äôm not nice or something Anyways so from that I Äôm still confused whether I have it or not because shes basically telling me I have it but she doesn Äôt want to put that label on me This appointment was several months ago maybe even a year ago now I just had a therapy appointment yesterday with a new therapist over the phone and she tells me that apparently this psychiatrist wrote on my file that I was diagnosed with bpd All I could do when she told me was laugh because I Äôm just at that point Ä like what the fuck She wasn Äôt clear about the diagnosis to me and even told me she didnt want to diagnose me with it because of the negative connotations unprofessional in my eyes Ä like I understand that people with bpd are often wrongfully portrayed as manipulative and shitty but thats so horrible in itself to categorize all people with an illness as shitty people and essentially saying Äúyou have almost all of the symptoms if not all of the disorder but i dont feel like diagnosing you with the disorder because I think it is a disorder for shitty people and I dont think you are shitty like that even though you have the symtpoms Ä Äù especially as a psychiatrist like anyways sorry this probably isnt super legible but I just needed to vent because what the fuck,Emotional Distress
Hi everyone i have a question and just wanted to know if anyone can relate at all it would probably make me 10x feel better So basically i still struggle sometimes with getting over an ex We dated for 3 years it was a toxic relationship He broke up with me after 2 years we tried to pursue a relationship again because we both still had feelings for eachother broke it off again and then after another 2 years we just casually hooked up for about 6 months before i met someone else who is now my current boyfriend and honestly the most beautiful soul i Äôve ever met But i just cant get my ex out of my head it Äôs not necessarily that i miss him alot or still have deep feelings for him well sometimes those deep feelings do come up when i see him somewhere or had a dream about him but thinking of him became more like a routine Basically what i want to know is if anyone else can relate not fully getting over someone i still think about him and sometimes i still cry about it even though its been like 5 years since we had the relationship and i dont think i will ever get over him for 100 but it annoys me and i feel quilty as well because this was the reason i never wanted to date someone else,Emotional Distress
I was watching a video that said bpd sufferers will often get caught in a mental trap of believing that if they feel strong emotions towards something then it is defiantly true When actually it is just delusion and paranoia But how often have you been paranoid about something and it has not actually happened I find this rarely happens to me and most of the time the paranoia was very valid For example you believe strongly that someone will abandon you and then it actually happens Or you feel like a friend is lying with no proof then you find out they actually did I find that most of the time the things I think are going to happen actually do happen What Äôs your experience of this,Emotional Distress
We have been dating for two years We both have friends of the opposite sex and it s fine with us I only hug my male friends when i greet them other than that we just talk I have extreme jealousy issues because of my BPD and my bf is my FP I am extremely attached to him and get sad whenever he talks to somebody else but i keeo that to myself because i know its ridiculous He has one childhood female friend He has known her for 10 years The thing is he s touchy with her the most out of all his friends She is touchy too she does that tk me too But the thing is i have had full on mental breakdowns and i have thrown up due to tje fact she sometimes took his hand in hers and he didn t refuse it They also play fight literally whenever they see eachother and that has just crushed me I ve told both of them my concern but they just reassured me that they re strictly platonic they re both in relationships and tje reason theyre touchy is becauxw they know both of them are comfortable w it Tbey didn t stop doing it though they just told me to work out my jealousy issues in therapy I understand that with BPD you get extreme irrational jealousy but i think this isnt the case I think this is pretty rational What do you guys think,Emotional Distress
The problem with mental illness is that it robs you of the solution to it which makes your mental illness worse which further robs you of it So I ve always had friends My symptoms are mostly turned inwards which lead to many people combatting my diagnosis when I first got it There was a small flare up last year which lead to me losing a lot of friends which a lot of people in the group had done worse stuff and knowing that only made the flare up worse I moved abroad and now I ve came back to pretty much nobody I sometimes go weeks without speaking to anyone This has took my internalised BPD and very much pushed it external Sadly the few people who I do still have in my life I m becoming increasingly more critical and fixated on their actions as They re now all I have Small things like them not messaging back or I didn t get invited somewhere just feels like they re pushing me away like everyone does And while I never raise these issues or anything they can definitely tell and it is pushing them away which is making everything worse And my people pleasing is through the roof because I just want someone around me It s also turned into social anxiety so Making friends has become harder than ever which makes me feel worse which makes my symptoms worse I ve stopped having casual flings despite being a social area I m still good with I stopped because I was getting jealous of these people I had a one night stand with This was never a thing in the past and it s a side of myself I really don t like This jealousy is in spite of me not wanting to take anything further with them because I know I m not in the right frame of mind to hold anyone on the mantle of partner But is cutting this out good or is it just another social area I m getting rid of and only going to make my symptoms worse I need to know how to make this better Honestly other areas of my life my hobbies side projects and soon to be employment are firing on all cylinders beso I think working on myself is all I really do but it hasn t made me any more comfortable being alone My attitude towards people is still decaying People say stop caring about what other people think and the friends will follow But if my reasoning to stop caring what people think is for other people to like me did I ever stop caring what people think I asked my therapist whilst I still had had one and she didn t ever give me an answer She just kind of repeated it back to me And yes I m medicating,Emotional Distress
i ve quite recently got into a new relationship and everything is so good they are incredibly supportive of all my issues even when they revolve in paranoia about them never seem to get mad or fed up with me experiencing mood swings etc however im really starting to get scared of the intensity that im feeling the love for them im 100 sure they love me too but sometimes u panic that my feelings are so much stronger and may scare them away or just be a bit overwhelming ive only just found out about the favourite person stuff and this has me even more in a panic i dont think i fully understand it but its got me thinking that the way i am is too much im like completely obsessed every time i see them i just melt inside and want to tell them how i feel about them or how beautiful they are and although i know these are nice things to hear im concerned that this is a negative thing somehow idek im probably just rambling but i feel like rn im spending every second tryna figure out ways to make sure this doesnt crash and burn even though the only evidence i have is that everythings perfect idk help üò üòÖ,Emotional Distress
I know there are a few therapies out there for BPD like Dialectical Behavior Therapy DBT I was wondering if anyone learned anything in therapy that has helped them which they would be willing to share In addition I was wondering what didn t work Has anyone tried therapy other than DBT I know its the most common one but sometimes I have heard CBT can work too It would be really nice to know if there is a light at the end of the tunnel and if therapy does work for some people,Emotional Distress

first off i don Äòt like calling my fp my favourite person for me it stands for focused person i have a heavy problem with switching between fps after the smallest triggers my boyfriend that i Äòve been dating and living with for 1 1 2 years was my fp but i splitted on him the first time after a year and lost my focus on him instead it switched over to a colleague of mine for a few months i was literally obsessed and felt like i was cheating i did NOT act on anything because of it I lost my focus on him when he was away for 3 weeks my real problem here is that i went from said colleague being my fp to it being my ex he cheated on me 2 years ago and i wasn Äòt happy in the relationship at all so he kinda did me a favour and gave me a reason to dump him i know all that but recently i caught myself making up an old imaginary version of him that has no flaws and i connect all my positive memories to it That was triggered by a heavy long lasting episode that i had because of my parents splitting up and me finding out that my ex has a new girlfriend I enjoyed that he was still obsessed with me all these years and it damaged my ego seeing that he has someone new Honestly i only wish him the best i don Äòt long after what we had but somehow i do I want him to be happy but i keep thinking of what we could Äòve done better He gave me the perfect amount of toxicity that my current bf doesn Äòt luckily but my self sabotaging ass somehow needs it to feel something I Äòm so used to the chaos that i can Äòt settle for a peaceful relationship I Äòm fighting so hard against my own head every single minute so please don Äòt give me shit for this I cannot control my emotions obviously I love my boyfriend so much but i can Äòt share these feelings with him so i just feel incredibly lonely with this I can still think rationally which makes this shit 10 times worse I wouldn Äòt share anything this personal on here if i wasn Äòt so desperate for someone who can at least tell me i Äòm not alone with all of this,Emotional Distress
Hey This will be a longish post but I need to get it out I m 26 and f and I ve only recently been diagnosed with BPD and it s been a whirlwind few months trying to wrap my head around that diagnosis I was admitted to an inpatient facility for 2 and a half weeks and was diagnosed with sensitivity ASD ADHD binge eating disorder BPD and Bipolar Just over 12 months ago my wife and I started trying to have a family and we fell pregnant the first try but unfortunately lost our angel at 8 weeks we then went on to have another miscarriage 2 months later and that was when my entire world started to fall apart I had a complete breakdown Feeling so lost out of touch with who I was battling the grief I was drowning in I now what I understand as split I split completely from the only person i ve loved in 7 years I stopped caring about her about myself I started to drink excessively and started to experiment with drugs i ve been anti drug my whole life this was completely out of character I broke up with my wife and started to give my affections to other people people that didn t matter We ve been back together for 6 months but my mind and affection still wonders regardless of the deep feelings I have for her She s my FP I ve been trying to find who I am because all i ve been for 7 years is my apart of this relationship where i ve lost all sense of who I am what I want and what I need I ve realised that I might be polyamorous my wife however is not I know that if I want to pursue that she will no longer be in my life Does anybody have the greatest fear that their FP will leave them but also have the need to be able to give more than one person love and affection in a different manner It seems so contradicting to me and I can t work it out in my head I m unsure if this will make a lot of sense to anyone It doesn t even make sense to me but any kind of input would be greatly appreciated,Emotional Distress
I have a gf She had many sexual partners in past My bpd makes me think that she is cheating on me I am paranoid that she has someone I always fight with her because I am so jealous I think its happening when I split and I cant stop doing it Idk should I break up with her because I cant control myself Every relationship ended because of me I can live normally with my bpd only when I am single,Emotional Distress
It Äôs sometimes hard to tell whether my feelings are valid or I Äôm having another mental episode I have to wait a couple of hours or a few days to clear my head to finally understand what it actually is At times I don Äôt end up understanding what it is and choose to just ignore the feeling It Äôs hard coping doing this Today I brought up something that my boyfriend did that upset me a few weeks ago I decided to bring it up as it was nagging my brain from time to time We didn Äôt fight I just communicated what was done that upset me He apologised and didn Äôt say anything else we didn Äôt discuss it further We just ended it at the apology It makes me think that he probably thinks this is one of my other episodes although I haven Äôt done anything impulsive I only brought up the subject It Äôs hard to tell whether being upset over this is impulsive or not,Emotional Distress
I must look fucking miserable Another shitty person parading as a friend cut off and now I m alone again I know I kinda said it s better to be alone than being friends with someone who s shitty to you behind your back but I didn t exactly realise how I ll start feeling like an open wound again This happens every time I shouldn t be surprised But at 23 I find myself feeling like a loser again The worst part is I don t even like these people They literally only ever talk to me when they need something I m barely acknowledged here And yet being alone with not anyone to talk to here feels like the end of the world I m aware enough to know it s not I don t wanna look lost even if I am So how do I fake being effortlessly unbothered,Emotional Distress
I feel like I Äôm just temporary and I Äôm only there for like character development or to introduce people to their real friends this has happened very often people will meet their eventual best friends through me and then we won Äôt talk as much and I feel like people only give me the time of day romantically because I Äôm easy and not that attractive so they don Äôt feel pressure I hate when attractive nice and successful people even come close to entering my life because it makes me feel so threatened and I feel like they Äôll steal anyone I Äôm close to because why would the people I Äôm close to stay with me if there are people that are better than me in every aspect and also don Äôt have this debilitating illness that drives people away from them It makes me really hateful towards people that have done nothing to me just because I am so jealous of them and am afraid they Äôll take away what I have Also side note idk how all of you are getting SOs left and right Sucks to have bpd and be butt ugly then I guess idk it makes me sad too,Emotional Distress
my cousin with BPD passed away she didn Äôt take her own life or overdose but her ED and inability to take care of herself essentially caused her body to shut down she was 26 she was sober and was working so hard to be a great aunt and person we come from a very Äúdon Äôt talk about mental health Äù family and although her parents were great support systems i know i also have bpd the pressures of your other family judging you and the paranoia of them leaving you or disowning you because of your actions her parents were the ones who introduced mine to each other without them i would not be here they were the only relatives we had in the area and she and her family were always people we looked up to as i got older she became a mentor to me and the only family member i could talk to about bpd and substance abuse or really any unhealthy coping mechanism about she was one of the main reason i stopped using and got my life together i have suspicions that one of her siblings was sexually abusing her but obviously i can Äôt ask her now and would not bring it up to her family all of my family says they find solitude in knowing she finally is at rest and that she never had to struggle anymore I understand where they Äôre coming from but it doesn Äôt sit right w me i know she was suffering but she also was trying to stay sober and had made it to the point where she had reasons to stay alive and fight i saw how she was healing herself and how much she cared about her family especially her nephews she was staying clean to be a role model to them i hate that they Äôre ignoring her progress and just immediately going to Äúshe Äôs done suffering Äù when she was clearly making progress and wanting to live,Emotional Distress
I m so tired of my partner invalidating me which he has literally admitted to me he does do sometimes Mostly it happens if I express and emotion opinion a thought he doesn t like or agree with or somehow maybe feels I m not entitled to feel or think anyway he often will say things like I m not listening to you because you re splitting etc in response to me having a feeling It s really upsetting feeling like I can t express myself and my human emotions without it being dismissed and blamed on just me being a crazy bitch with BPD whose splitting and has ONLY erratic and OTT emotions And it just isn t accurate at all I don t know what to do its hard when you love someone and you re addicted to them to feel so invalidated I can t find any videos online about this anytime I search bpd and invalidation it s always about how pwBPD invalidate their partners cos ofc we re the bad guys right Anyway just wanted to vent and see if anyone relates,Emotional Distress
Does anyone else notice that they can t get their favorite person off their mind All day everyday He is just a FWB and not even that right now I have never felt so focused on anyone else and I don t like feeling like this Even if we were in a committed relationship I shouldn t think about someone this much I try to distract myself to focus on other things but they are always on my mind Any suggestions to help,Emotional Distress
i Äôm sorry in advance if this is disorganized my mind is feeling really scrambled and i Äôm hurting a lot more than usual inside right now but Ä my fp just blocked my number and now i Äôm never going to speak to him again i Äôve spent every single day for the past 2 weeks crying and trying to figure out what went wrong because we used to talk every single day and we had been talking for 10 months now but until today he hadn Äôt responded to a text i sent him for 2 weeks exactly last night i couldn Äôt sleep and i ended up sending him a really long text basically just detailing how him ghosting me really hurt my feelings and how it was immature and disrespectful of him to do that and that even if we Äôre just friends you don Äôt treat friends like that because friends are supposed to be people you care for and he wasn Äôt treating me like someone he cared about i also told him in this text that something i struggle a lot with is feeling used and disposable to the people i care about because a lot of times it seems like they don Äôt care about me as much as i care about them these feelings were exacerbated by the fact that right before he ghosted me we had hooked up and he promised me before anything happened that he wasn Äôt using me and he genuinely cared about me but wasn Äôt ready for a relationship because at the time we weren Äôt living in the same place but he is moving to where i live after summer so basically we Äôve been talking for 10 months hooked up once in the past back in october of last year but i ghosted him after a few weeks because he started talking to me less and i was getting scared that he was going to leave me so i left him first and then about a week later i unblocked him and apologized profusely we started talking again like normal and ended up hooking up again in april and then he ghosted me right after i found out tonight that he now has a girlfriend i don Äôt know how long they Äôve been together for but somehow in the last month since i Äôve seen him and he told me he cared about me but didn Äôt want to date until he moved down to where i live he Äôs gotten a girlfriend and it fucking HURTS as soon as i saw them together on instagram i couldn Äôt control myself and immediately sent him a Äúfuck you Äù text and told him i wished he had the decency to be honest about what he wanted from me and all i got out of him was 2 meaningless sentences and a blocked number to add insult to injury i don Äôt even think he read my long text i Äôve calmed down a lot since it Äôs been about 2 hours since this all unfolded but i really dont fucking know what to do even in the time when we weren Äôt talking i wanted nothing more than to talk to him and thought about him all the time and constantly was thinking of the times we were able to spend together in person and how much i still cared for and love him even though he wasn Äôt talking to me for whatever reason now that i know why he stopped talking to me and seeing the fact that he didn Äôt give a shit about my feelings i Äôm going to be stuck in the loop of thinking about why i wasn Äôt good enough for him and trying to figure out why and where and when and how everything went wrong and i just don Äôt know what to do with myself without him Ä my friends just say i need to grieve and find the good in life which i understand and don Äôt blame them for saying but i don Äôt know how to feel any good when my life feels like it Äôs only temporary highs and permanent lows if anyone has ever been in a situation like this or has any advice at all please please help me i Äôm feeling so incredibly lost and alone right now,Emotional Distress
I Äôve been blowing my fp Äôs phone up all night because I got upset earlier and now I look crazy Part of me feels like I Äôm being overbearing and manipulative but the other part of me feels like I Äôm hurt and I deserve better I don Äôt know which one is the truth maybe both but I keep going through the messages I Äôve sent tonight and I just wish I didn Äôt respond to things the way that I do It Äôs frustrating because I want to do better but when I Äôm dealing with someone who seemingly doesn Äôt even try to understand my feelings it makes me react 10x worse I Äôm just tired of going through this,Emotional Distress
Being split on is new to me first time falling for women with bpd but i can confirm it sucks and couldn Äôt have come at a worse time Will I eventually hear from her again How do you respond to being ghosted Should I give chase or would that make things worse I want to be respectful of her feelings but at the same time leaving things like this doesn Äôt sit right with me I Äôve put in a tremendous amount of time energy and work adjusting and learning because I care for her deeply And I Äôm sure she would say the same The highs and lows are intense but I think I Äôve become pretty good at managing that parts of it all But her going no contact suddenly has me feeling all these mixed emotions Ä any input from a neutral party would be greatly appreciated The last thing I want to do in this situation is to make what ever she Äôs dealing with more difficult,Emotional Distress

F22 here and I just can Äôt get past this wall of shame I Äôve been experiencing lately for my previous actions and idk how to move past it and feel better even though I Äôm trying v hard to act different in my current relationships I Äôve always been extremely obsessive over people in my past and it Äôs just flat out embarrassing Most recently hardcore professing how into this guy I was after he clearly was not showing interest I sent him paragraphs on paragraphs just so embarrassing Before that I was obsessed with this guy I was kind of hooking up with and like quadruple texted him made him playlists and everything when he would barely respond and clearly wasn Äôt into me like that Things like this have happened on numerous occasions and looking back at how desperate and diluted i was and I feel trapped in a lot of shame about it Not only the obsessiveness over people but an obsession for attention from them more so as a teenager just doing extremely attention seeking behaviors to get them to love me and pay attention to me This has just been going on for so long what kinda triggered this shame spiral was reading old diaries and texts that just make me wanna cry of how much I devalued my self worth obsessing over people who don Äôt care about me I Äôm just so embarrassed and ashamed Any insight helps,Emotional Distress
I can Äôt fucking deal with these emotions anymore The swings are so intense I would rather be stabbed in the stomach It feels so utterly torturous I wouldn Äôt want even the worst person on the planet to feel this feeling for more than an hour Please how do I make it stop I just want it to fucking stop It hurts If anyone has any coping mechanisms to lower the intensity of my feelings or if anyone is willing to just be a friend that would be really helpful,Emotional Distress
I was with someone for five months and broke up with him that was my first real relationship btw After that about 7 months after that first break up i got with this other dude and that only lasted a week because he ghosted me over the weekend and then just never said anything to me in person After him about two weeks later i texted my first ex dumb on my part and we got back together after only like three days of catching up after 8 months of not talking He broke up with me this morning LMAO I think i should just stay single for some time Being single sucks because i need that feeling that someone really cares about me and loves me but at the same time i get really bad during relationships Plus both of my relationships ended horribly Idk is anyone else kinda in a situation like this or is this mainly just a me thing and not part of my bpd,Emotional Distress

Hey I wanted to post here to see if anyone has had similar experiences amp x200B For some history I have a diagnosed Panic disorder that I ve had since I was a kid and I m a fairly anxious person but highly social I have never been diagnosed with a mood or panic disorder However I have a partner now for about 7 months who is rapid cycling bipolar They re medicated and have done a lot of therapy Since being with someone who is well educated on mood personality disorders and has been teaching me about their own I m starting to notice patterns in myself and my past that aren t normal I ve been struggling with coming to terms with it but I think there s a decent chance that I have BPD and I m not sure where to begin amp x200B I m fairly good at regulating my emotions and words as I have in the past had extremely angry lash outs that have ruined friendships relationships and have forced me to grow as a person I don t handle rejection well usually sends me spiraling emotionally I ve never had a relationship last longer than 6 months as usually around this time conflict begins to arise and I m completely incapable of dealing with it I start to believe I m being emotionally abused I look for evidence of narcissism in the partner Instead of addressing the core of conflict I find other reasons for it that have nothing to do with me Sometimes I m even well aware that that s what I m doing I know my thoughts are irrational but I have a very hard time getting them under control I ve fully convinced myself that my partner is secretly cheating on me or lying about things I ve done this with friends too have fully accused them of lying to me about things that ended up being made up in my mind I will say that these fears and thoughts aren t completely senseless as I ve had a number of situations where I was treated quite poorly including an alcoholic step father and a much older than me partner with a drug problem in my early 20 s but at the same time I should be able to compartmentalize and not believe everyone in my life is out to get me and ruin things for me amp x200B I guess I just want to know if anyone has dealt with these thoughts So many people with BPD talk about having big lash outs which I don t really have anymore but the thoughts I used to have before having them still exist I just don t externalize it like I used to But being completely incapable of staying calm during conflict with friends family coworkers and now my partner is going to ruin my life eventually I emotionally can t function until it is fully resolved If this isn t a trait of BPD can anyone point me in the right direction And if it is where do I begin and how do I get help I seriously can t handle the way my brain deals with conflict anymore Every small bad thing that happens makes me feel like it s the end of the world It s running me down emotionally and mentally and every connection is my life is unstable in a big way Not sure where to begin,Emotional Distress
I swear every time I am away from my FP it feels like withdrawal We Äôre friends and not partners so as much as I wish I could I cannot just spend every waking moment with him but I say yes to every opportunity I can to be around him Even something as small as going grocery shopping together after work feels like the world to me I like his company so much that my fianc e says it Äôs like he Äôs my boyfriend I confess there is a ring to it if grossly inaccurate The moment we part ways it Äôs like a surge of emptiness fills me How much I miss my FP and love him becomes all that Äôs on my mind I do my best not to open his insta to get a look at his pretty face in order to pretend I Äôm near him But I do find myself moaning to myself how much I miss him and love him I want to curl up in a ball and cry until the next time I talk with him The last thing I want to do is excise my FP from my life He is incredibly fond of me even if not in a romantic way He Äôs the one who really jump started our friendship He Äôs been a net positive in my own life encouraging me to finally pursue a career Heck I Äôm even considering law school knowing how much he thinks I Äôm capable of More than anything I just care for him and want to be there for him as much as it is appropriate to I just don Äôt want to feel so much pain whoever I don Äôt have access to his attention How am I supposed to dial back these feelings It feels impossible,Emotional Distress
hello everyone i was just wondering if you all have the same problem as i do that i can t feel the love people give to me like i can t process that people actually care about me and love me no matter how kind someone is to me i have loving people in my life who understand this disorder and who keep reassuring me but no matter how much i get i can t feel it in my heart and it makes me feel so sad and constantly want more if someone important to me shows me a lot of kindness i feel very warm in the moment and sometimes i can even process that i m actually loved which gives me a lot of hope but after usually just an hour or two it disappears and i go back to feeling that constant dread in my heart another big problem with it is that while i can t feel the love people give to me i can still feel the love they give to others so i get very jealous sometimes for stupid reasons i m really scared that if i keep going like this then it ll get draining for the people in my life does anyone know what to do about this why i feel this way or have any tips or ways to cope with it or feel the same way i also recently started going to therapy so i m hoping that will help i really hope all of you are doing alright and let s do our best to fight this disorder,Emotional Distress

I posted this on a throwaway and it got deleted __ so ill try to remember what i wrote as much as possible I love my boyfriend but he Äôs not the greatest at comforting me He usually kind of dismisses what I say or barely responds and it makes me feel like im not worth listening to it hurts a lot too because he wasnt this way at first he used to voice his concern for me and apologize whenever he made me feel bad but now its the exact opposite I have my own support system my longtime group of friends but idk I just would prefer comfort from my partner sometimes It makes me depressed for days when I bring something up and he either diminishes it or ignores it We have an age gap of 6 years so I wonder if that Äôs a factor in our different mindsets when it comes to mental health I Äôm really tired of loving him one day and being mad at him the next just cause he didn Äôt respond to me the way I wanted him to It just hurts so much I feel lonely when I try to talk to him about my problems so I end up not doing so at all most of the time,Emotional Distress

almost everytime someone slightly disappoints me i split on them its small things too like stopping a action that was consistent for a period of time not doing what they said they would do suddenly changing plans me finding out theyre hanging out with other friends only happens with my fp etc i notice most of these things really mess me up when my fp does them it drives me insane tbh bc then i start panicking and wondering if i did something wrong or i get really angry and want to cut contact it feels like something serious happened between us so when they act normally after the thing happens i get even more mad bc im thinking you did this terrible thing to me and now you re acting like nothing happened its weird bc sometimes i realize its a insignificant thing and they dont know it upset me but other times i dont realize what im doing and it messes me up so much i just want to lash out and pull the how could you do this to me i want to understand this more but it seems inevitable to stop since i cant just ask people to stop doing these things,Emotional Distress
So my ex broke up with me 3 months ago now Ä still reeling but I Äôm confused At first she broke up with me because of her BPD however this changed to me taking her for granted words not matching my actions etc Following this however it changed to me being perfect and not doing anything wrong Then back to me not being perfect and neither is she However I don Äôt believe I did any of these things but that Äôs besides the point I validated her feelings She told me also that Äòshe felt smothered by herself and me Äô Ä What does that mean I know she Äôs a fearful avoidant type of AS I Äôm just so lost I Äôm in NC for almost two months now and I Äôm still stuck on that phrase Any help explaining would be great,Emotional Distress
So a month ago I broke up with my very toxic ex It was a very hard break up and even though I ve taken big steps to getting over him of course things are not completely cleared up in my head yet I met my new FP a few months ago playing online video games and we ve technically become video game buddies by now We even exchanged social media and we ve been talking regularly if not everyday It s clear he likes me as a person and enjoys my company And I know it sounds silly but I started noticing that I ve become attached Sometimes he ll leave me on read and it hurts If we don t text for a day I miss him I m trying to stop myself from getting any more attached but I feel like the only way is to stop playing talking with him and I feel so bad and don t want to do that I catch myself romanticizing him and he actually is one of the most attractive people I ve met both physically and mentally But it could never work like that between us cause he lives in an other country and is focusing on his studies he even told me he is taking a break from dating etc and I respect that So yeah anyone has any tips to not get further attached to this new person It s really hard considering how attracted I am to him and my neediness for having someone care for me I catch myself making scenarios in my head that obviously will never happen and it hurts a lot Idk if the feelings are amplified because of my break up or what But I was attracted to him even before I broke up with my ex But I obviously didn t act on them,Emotional Distress
So I 21 M know this girl 21 F I ve known her for a very long time went to school together we ve been good friends for fairly long Now she has been in a 3 year relationship with this guy they cheated on each other more than once yet somehow always stayed together She always wanted to leave him but couldn t Eventually I told her that I was attracted to her and knew that she was too but I wouldn t want to start anything with her til she was still with this guy After some weeks she tells me that they re breaking up and after a bit more we start seeing each other regularly and having sex The relationship went good for about five months and I could tell she was into me and was having a good time too Then one day she tells me that she s going to visit her cousins for the weekend and when she returns she starts acting suspicious so I ask her what s going on but she wouldn t tell me After a long on and off she finally tells me that she didn t go see her cousins but her ex Now it s been three weeks since we haven t heard from each other anymore I m still surprised that she did what she did and why Now I know that this might seem like me trying to give myself an answer to that and me just being delusional but lately I started to inform myself on BPD and although I ve just scratched the surface I recognized a lot of patterns and behaviors that match up to hers Especially regarding relationships As soon as I started mentioning the idea of us being a couple she started to freak out yet she was the one who had always been more attached and seeming to want commitment The fact that she can t get out of the relationship with her ex the fact of her pushing away me one of her few friends that she has left A lot of thing add up And I guarantee that there is a bunch of other stuff that matches up too Now what she did is unforgivable but I feel like if she actually has BPD things would be different and I d still want her to be part of my life cause I wouldn t want to be another person that she pushes away from herself I know that she went in the past to a psychologist but for a short time It could even be that she was diagnosed but didn t tell anyone I don t know if I should tell her about it or just let it be Again I am not 100 certain The thing is I don t even know if it would be good for her to know that she has it But I kinda want to intervene because I know that she s suffering now and she doesn t want to lose me either What would you do Assuming she has BPD do you think she needs to know or is it better to just let things be I hope I didn t offend anyone I m new to all this,Emotional Distress

Recently I ve been seeing someone with BPD and I do not have BPD but I do research it due to having a previous friend with much more severe BPD Things go okay she s afraid to blowup and act abusive towards me I m afraid to do something that will cause her to split on me I was going to bring her on vacation down south with me as we have been casually seeing each other for a little over a month now But we did get in 2 pretty intense fights and I made the call to slow things down and enjoy the vacation with my friends instead I just got out of a long term relationship and I didn t expect to get into another relationship so quickly but it sort of happened and I do care about her a lot and am learning to deal with her explosive emotions but she seems to have gained much more of an attachment much more quickly towards me compared to how I build connection attachment to my partner We both have SUD so it s a bit rocky in that way and she is aware that I will end the relationship if I notice it making it more difficult for me to be sober from opioids She drinks daily and is working on reducing that safely and slowly as well Just looking to hear some experiences from either end of the relationship and how things are going People with BPD love so deeply that it is hard to reject the relationship especially with things going so well like they have been recently but I m not in a position to fully give myself to someone else either And maybe not for several months Sexually things are a bit unusual for me with her having a rape abuse sort of fantasy fetish from her previous relationships and abuse she s been through and my sex drive is very low compared to hers average due to opioid addiction although we still have a good time in bed I can t always cum when I m using which can make her self conscious Sexually in general my last partner was much more similar to me in what we wanted to experiment with non monagomy and so on The girl I m dating now is monagomous all the way and cannot imagine or understand wanting anything else Which is not a big thing for me as I do feel my ex was a lot more into that And we used to sleep with another BPD girl and cam have threesomes so I was surprised to see how different everything can be even among pwBPD Im aware that sounds ignorant but the hypersexuality of the other pwBPD was really intense and a huge part of who she was,Safe/Neutral
Hello I am not looking for a diagnosis online neither am I trying to self diagnose I am asking for insight Over the years I went through many different diagnosis been on almost all the medications they could put me on as a child in my country My current pyschiatrist and pyschologist told me he wants to diagnose me with BPD when I become a legal adult which is pretty soon I don t want this to happen for several reasons but I won t get into that right now My questions are that are hopefully not offensive Can you have BPD if you have relatively stable relationship without being in therapy Is it possible to have BPD and not have frequent breakdowns Is it possible to have BPD and never splitting aka having a stable opinion about people that usually aren t changing unless something happens I don t think there s anything wrong with the above things or BPD I have loved ones with BPD I am just wondering if I am on my way to get misdiagnosed again,Safe/Neutral

everything I Äôve read about BPD so far insinuates that it is a result of childhood trauma related to caretakers My parents are very sweet and understanding and supportive and gave me constant and consistent attention and honestly spoiled me and still to this day remind me that I Äôm Äúthe best Äù I feel super lucky to have them in my life when I was living with them as a child and for a few months after I graduated college things were rough because I was pretty entitled and critical and I Äôd have little patience with them I have been horridly mean towards them in the past and still sometimes take them and their support for granted I Äôm just curious where my bpd symptoms may have otherwise come from also as an aside they LOVE my FP because she is well off has a career is stable and takes extremely good care of me They have been hoping we get married for a couple years but my FP has repeatedly made it clear she only sees me as a friend and once recently mentioned that kissing me would feel ridiculous like kissing her brother Äîwhich kind of hurt tbh but is a good sobering reminder that she Äôs likely not my Äúlife partner Äù,Safe/Neutral
I have a pretty decent sense of self Mentally I have a pretty good grasp on who I am My issue come when I try to figure whom I am I look in the mirror on occasion and wonder who that is as I don t recognize them Other times I will feel wrong or react to things in a way not conducive to who I appear to be Confused yet I will do something and think back and think wow that is not something someone my age would think or what someone my gender might think Its like I m a balance of everything and its confusing to say the least because what comes out of my mouth is often not in the least bit close to what people believe should come out This isn t a bad thing in any sense its just unusual,Safe/Neutral

Good morning everyone I just wanted to share a coping mechanism that has helped me incredibly much throughout the years It s the thought stopping mechanism which can effectively combat the obsessive thought cycle What you do is begin thinking about a positive memory that makes you very happy and try to remember as many details as possible down to the specifics until you have completely distracted yourself from the obsessive thought Example As a kid I loved going on vacation to Cape May beach It made me so happy and I truly felt at peace there I remember arriving at the beach house early in the morning and being greeted by my cousins ___ and ___ whom I hadn t seen in a while They were so happy to see me I was so excited to go to my room and unpack my suitcase After we unpacked we all headed to the beach I remember how happy I felt walking across the warm sand and feeling the cool ocean breeze on my skin I brought a lot of beach toys to play with and a wiffle ball bat football and my favorite teddy bear Cuddles I sat Cuddles on my beach towel next to me so he could enjoy the beautiful view Then after that we went And it continues on and on It s so simple and very effective I swear this has helped me so many times and I hope it can help you as well üíó,Safe/Neutral
a couple days ago i talked about how i felt like an imposter because my bpd symptoms have lessened and have been less severe than they were last year i did research and it turns out you don t quite fully recover from bpd but you can definitely have symptoms get better or just straight up go into remission where you no longer fit the criteria sometimes i get triggered to where those symptoms of bpd would come out but not to a severe extent to where it was last year i still experience the symptoms so i know i still fit the criteria but i think i have recovered the main predictors for recovery are not being hospitalized having at least one stable relationship having a stable educational function and absence of self harm and i have achieved all of that this year woo hoo üëç üèΩ but my question is why did i go into a yearlong bpd spiral where did these symptoms come from and why so abruptly i spent new years in the hospital and stopped going as soon as december hit i know this is a good thing i am not complaining just confused this could mean that the ungodly amount of medications that i ve been put on last year worked even though everytime a pill entered my body i tripped out and got even worse i am the same way with meds still i just react badly to them and i m sensitive to them so if we cancel out the meds and therapy because that was always useless did i just outgrow the symptoms even though i was just diagnosed last year along with bipolar did my brain chemistry alter i am really confused üò bpd is such a weird disease,Safe/Neutral
One of the signature markers of BPD as you know is emotional regulation While you cannot help the intensity of your emotions you can absolutely control your reaction We react because the pain is intolerable and we want to do whatever it takes to stop the pain So we lash out we do something we regret But do not try to get rid of it Sit with it confront it When you are triggered and in distress your heart races you start to feel the rage and stress consume your body But if you can calm the physical symptoms you will in return calm your mind Your body and mind has a symbiotic relationship Calm your nervous system by taking deep breaths one nostril at a time Plug one nostril inhale then alternate to the other nostril and exhale Then inhale Then alternate Repeat This is called nada shodana in yoga or alternate nostril breathing The intensity of pain WILL pass It will come back again but it will pass again Every time it passes or the intensity dwindles give yourself a pat on the back You should be proud You got through it Keep doing this Eventually it will become easier as you develop this habit New neural pathways will be built Trust in neuroplasticity The feelings of distress will become more fleeting It requires putting up a fight but you can do it You are not hopeless You are loved and you are here with all of us,Safe/Neutral

This is a creative question because BPD is a unique disorder we essentially grew up with really deep and sensitive emotions and I was asked by my therapist about two years ago Äú what does your heart look at after all these years Äù That Äôs a big question since I Äôm a writer I could give her hundreds of descriptions but I couldn Äôt give her just one beginning with ÄúKintsugi third degree burns mutated stitched up dual toned shattered and repurposed like a disco ball Ä ect Äù yet I went into describing how deep empathy felt inside your body It was an odd conversation but I liked it a lot The question hit something internally that I Äôm trying to justify with art I Äôm drawing as many types as I can but I Äôm looking for more perspective not just my own QUESTION ÄúWhat does your soul heart look like with BPD after all these years Äù PLEASE do not be rude to me or others responding everyone has their own experiences to this disorder and they Äôre all valid it can be a singular feeling currently or it can be conflicted between two parts of you thank you so much üíï,Safe/Neutral
I Äôve been in several relationships but I don Äôt think I Äôve ever fallen in love Sure I loved the people I dated and I Äôd do anything for them but no more or less than for others I feel like emotionally you should have this love for everyone until they give you reason not to I loved specific things about the people I dated beyond surface level but I don Äôt feel like I was IN love with their being rather with what they we could be Their Our potential Usually I can read a person Äôs character fast Solely based on their use of words expressions body language and psychology I Äôm no psychologist but I Äôve been researching the subject and human nature since I was a kid This is why my interest automatically goes to people I can Äôt read easily Once they open up to me it Äôs like my emotional interest dies off a bit I still want to help them improve theirselves when they are open to it and I still love them like anyone but they fascinate me less than before I also don Äôt feed particularly bad after someone leaves me or when I break up with someone because I feel like I gave it my all and it just wasn Äôt meant to be I try to stay open minded and would much rather level with someone than argue because arguing WILL make me upset if not out of control Which barely happens Is this a BPD thing,Safe/Neutral

This is not a reccomendation but I have found that using dissociatives can actually heal DPDR It is counter intuitive like why would I take something that will make me feel like I have even more of DPDR First the high doesn t really feel like DPDR it s just similar in some ways Second drugs that cause DPDR are not necessarily dissociative drugs e g it can be a perfectly fine weed high ending with DPDR out of blue My laymans explanation is that my brain was stuck in a dissociative state and then I added some drugs to make myself even worse but when the drug wore off my brain also took away it s former DPDR as if it were a part of the effect It was quite remarkable just a single dose of 2F DCK Ketamine analog has done this I still have some way to go but whatever happened was definitely real Just my two cents Manual cross post from r DPDR gt Original post https www reddit com r dpdr comments rqfy0i dissociatives_a_counter_intutive_treatment_for,Safe/Neutral

Okay sinceI was diagnosed with BPD back in 2018 and this past year really worked on therapies and so on But today something positive happened For the first time since I can remember I reconnected with my inner child like a bit of a jumpstart spark I took my daughter who is my exact clone look wise on the fairground rides One in particular was the swings they have As they lifted and went higher and faster my little girl sat next to me Her eyes shining so bright from the lights her awe her laughter her putting her arms out and saying look mummy we Äôre flying we Äôre free like birds her smiles jump started memories of me doing the exact same that age it was like watching a younger version of myself And I Äôm not going to lie I think for the first time in a very long time I felt true happiness and inner peace I was laughing with her Sticking my arms out with her Smiling and laughing just as much as she was and it was so bittersweet My daughter will never know the significance of this night to me But she has got me to start reconnecting with things that I thought were long long lost I thought I would share it somewhere because it means the world to me whilst sat crying happy tears,Safe/Neutral

With BPD lots of small interactions can hurt us deeply And even when we address it and they apologize it may not still feel fully healed And they or we may slip up and do the same thing again One thing I like to do is a Do Over where you or your partner call out a hurtful behavior and then ask to re do the moment as if you went back in time and act nicer kinder as needed It helps practice better communication form healthy habits and help heal emotional wounds For example Scenario You want to watch your favorite show with your partner but your partner does not because they are very tired after working Their response causes an emotional trigger Example with The Do Over You walks in room Do you want watch this show tonight Partner groans Ugh no You That hurt my feelings The tone made me feel rejected and I feel really hurt by this Partner I m sorry I hurt you that was very rude of me can we do over You Yes we can walks out of room and walks back in Can we watch this show tonight Partner with a nice warmer tone I feel very tired tonight so if it s okay I just want to cuddle Would it be ok if we could watch it tomorrow You Of course VS An unhealthy relationship interaction You Do you want to watch this show tonight Partner Ugh no You now emotionally distressed Why Do you not like me anymore Partner Why do you jump to conclusions when I just don t want to do something with you Give me a break You now even more emotionally distressed Why are you getting angry with me I just wanted to watch a show chaos and negativity ensues amp x200B Hope this helps There is a lot of partners W O BPD asking for help Also is a good general communication for relationships Sometimes just apologies may feel incomplete the Do Over is an extra step to ensure the healing conflict resolution process,Safe/Neutral

Hi everyone I have a friend who lives with BPD I have known her for 5 years online I have been close to her I would say for 1 2 years We talk at least once every 2 days The past week 7 days she has not responded or seen any of my messages 4 different platforms or calls I am still added on all of these platforms She has discarded split in the past where she deleted me on 2 platforms but only if we are having a big argument about things She has never done this long ghosting thing before though for no reason About 3 5 months ago I told her that I would visit her after I had finished all my medical appointments I have brought that up a few times during this time especially the last month or 2 About 2 months ago her nan passed away I don t think this is the reason as she kept me updated on how she was feeling that entire time even when she went to the funeral I want to theorise that she s doing the thing where she doesn t want a friend to get too close as it could be at the back of her mind She doesn t get phased if I don t respond straight away The last video she sent me was just a regular funny video that I reacted with a loveheart that we normally do After that I haven t heard from her at all She is still on fortnite though with 1 friend and playing duos which is not very characteristic for her as she always plays squads LIKE ALWAYS I just don t know if she is alright What does everyone think Sorry for such a long post Thank you for reading,Safe/Neutral
For around 6 years now I Äôve lived in central Florida Upon first moving here I made a lifelong connection with the first friend I made here in high school I Äôve always felt romantically inclined to this person and for around the past 5 months I Äôve been talking and spending time with her in a much more romantic way and she Äôs developed feelings for me as well While talking to her more frequently I learned that she struggles with BPD and I began doing as much research as possible to keep things healthy between us We Äôve had deep conversations in regards to our future and she has even brought up the fact that she Äôs never imagined marrying anyone until I came into the picture While she has feelings for me she doesn Äôt currently want a relationship due to her mental instability and doesn Äôt want to ruin our chances at having a more intimate future together I Äôm currently her FP and we talk daily I Äôve never in my life felt so attached or so willing to do anything possible to make things work out with this person I fantasize about our futures together daily and I can Äôt imagine myself ever having feelings for anyone else I Äôm interested in some general advice on how to handle a situation like this and show this person my emotional attachment and undying support and love for them without being overwhelming I Äôve never felt so happy having someone feel this way for me and I want to do anything in my power to have a future with this person,Safe/Neutral
First of all I Äôm very grateful for this forum and I have to say it has helped me understand my BPD Friend and I honestly just wish I Äôd seen this sooner Context is that I Äôm a 27M and have known my friend for now 4 years She is a BPD diagnosed 27F we were just acquaintances at first and I only learned about her mental disorder when we caught up in end 2020 and started becoming closer She had a boyfriend at the time and we started texting more she coincidentally came to work in my same company Long story short we started being more close she started sexting even tho in relationship which I was shocked about at first until I learned about BPD features One day she broke up with her bf and that same week I had hooked up with a girl She learned about it and told me how jealous she was about that in a playful way came to my house and we ended up having sex We have been having a friends with benefits situation which has been s per intense feelings wise and I have to say I didn Äôt really think much of it We were not awkward at work overall managed to keep it a secret and it was ok Now chaos SPLITTING she organized a weekend away for my birthday and literally delivered me a dream on a platter She Made food made love and she gifted me keychains with our pictures on then and everything She kept saying how much I was important to her and how even when she had crises episodes I was good to her I knew we were close and all but that made me feel happy and maybe we were going in a good direction relationship wise Must admit I might have not been too good at keeping her condition in mind and I was not thinking enough about our friendship Anyway fast forward to this week she basically stopped talking to me completely and stopped texting and being super shady Keep in mind we would text non stop and usually kept each other posted about our plans or what we were doing I had seen her getting closer to her direct colleague at work we work in the same department as I Äôve taken a new job total coincidence too they were taking coffee breaks together etc they are same age but I always thought ok she Äôs being social I Äôve now made the connection and learned that they are sleeping together they showed up at the same time and were obviously super shady and I Äôm not stupid They also made a comment which gave it away I know that getting into a FWB relationship knowing her condition was the dumbest stupid thing I could have ever done Also because I Äôve caught feelings she has been doing many things that would provoke that Ä and now well I Äôm fuming knowing that for no reason she just hates me and moved on to fuck the next best thing I Äôm obviously super jealous and that is my own issue But what about her what should I do Sorry for the long story but what sort of advice can you give me here,Safe/Neutral
wondering if this is a BPD thing to be kind of codependant on a pet benefitting from an emotional support animal idk my cat does help in being a constant in my life and keeps me on a routine with responsibilities that i take super seriously because i know his sweet little life is in my hands Its also just comforting that even when im isolating myself from people as a coping method i have his companionship i used to think emotional support animal was such a stupid term but for me at least that is really what my cat is lmao I also adopted him knowing he has behavioural issues and aggression me too lmao can relate that his owners surrendered him to the humane society for that ive found building trust and learning how to communicate with him SO rewarding and knowing ill never ever give up on him and i can give him the life i wish i had that people wouldnt give up on me and its just me and him against the world Even after adopting my own pet ive been getting more involved in wanting to help animals with volunteering and fostering because of of how rewarding it is to see their change in behaviour health and ability to gain trust and understanding with them I think it could be something to think about for other people with BPD Also especially for young women with BPD so many of the people involved in animal volunteering these days is young women lmao which i didnt realize until someone pointed it out to me but it really kind of is an underlying maternal instinct i think as a woman in my early 20s that i do really love using my ability to care for these little guys that need my help and that theyre just so cute and lovey in return,Safe/Neutral

BPD doesn t suck completely There s more to our lives than being miserable and mentally ill We are people with personalities and there are some positive aspects of the disorder that make life more fun With emotions being so intense a moment of happiness can be sheer euphoria Impulses can turn out to be great ideas like spontaneous road trips or exploring nature We can lend the deepest and most understanding sympathy and wisdom you will ever know because we have been to the darkest ends of the Earth several times We can be life of the party the person that lights up a room and the well loved one that makes everyone laugh We ll just internalize our pain and fail to believe people care about us but we are more loved than we know There s a certain point where all the crazy psycho shit you do becomes funny and you start to admire yourself for being ballsy There s more keep it going in the comments if you got anything,Safe/Neutral

Hello everyone I Äôm here just to look for some advice and guidance and share my thoughts currently I Äôve been in a relationship with my current boyfriend for 1 year and he Äôs amazing he Äôs very kind and loving towards me and is a genuine person I Äôve witnessed him do very kind things that he doesn Äôt even know i Äôm aware of and Im really happy with him and also in love He did tell me that he struggled with depression in college and he sometimes gets waves of it when he Äôs under a lot of stress and I can usually tell when something is up with him but he Äôs never been mean to me or hurt my feelings Anyways just yesterday he revealed to me that he got diagnosed with BPD over 5 years ago and takes medication for it I didn Äôt know how to respond so I just said Äúthank you for sharing this me i know it probably wasn Äôt easy to bring this up Äù He told me about how no one in his family knows I never really noticed anything abnormal with his behavior and never seen him taking medication we are both religious so we don Äôt have an intimate relationship but we do hang out in person Of course my curiosity got the best of me and I did research about this and of course with reading on Reddit I haven Äôt seen many positive stories of people in relationships with someone with BPD So far this first year has been amazing but after reading all these things i Äôm becoming paranoid I am a little bit hurt that he kept that from me for so long but in our culture mental health is very very stigmatized so I can understand why he was apprehensive but I love him so I wouldn Äôt have broken things off just because of that I do have some questions because I am still very ignorant on this condition Regarding BPD do people have any awareness or control over their behaviors Are they able to mask it in anyway I keep getting this intrusive thought that maybe he was masking somehow and that Äôs why I never noticed any abnormal behavior from him or maybe that Äôs from the medication Also is it something that can be Äúcured Äù I am still just hung up on the fact that I really didn Äôt notice anything at all from him I never noticed anything particular about his behavior other than he Äôs a really good man Is there a spectrum within the BPD community Like some severe and more mild Or across the bored there Äôs some typical behaviors I Äôm really sorry if any of my questions came off as offensive as I am not very educated on this but I am trying to learn more,Safe/Neutral

I Äôve found that BPD can be helpful if you practice mindfulness and self love it Äôs easy to get in a good mood just as it Äôs easy to be in a bad one and it Äôs all based on internal thoughts and external stimulation Of course something random may happen to make us angry but we can listen to affirmations and meditate to have much quicker access to nirvana In a way we Äôre blessed to know exactly what nurtures the soul and what smothers it Like watching the news gives me an instant headache and makes me mad so I don Äôt watch it while other people may not be able to see what causes their anger because the reaction is delayed Just a thought there Äôs always a silver lining and it Äôs a choice to view a cup as half empty or half full God doesn Äôt make mistakes we don Äôt have a disorder we simply operate differently The whole world is in disorder despite being built by Äúnormal people Äù so who Äôs to say those with Äúdisorders Äù couldn Äôt create a more orderly and harmonious civilization I see every aspect of myself as a gift because it allows me to be different and unique and to be more in touch with god and nature than my piers,Safe/Neutral

A highly sensitive person HSP is someone who is thought to have an increased or deeper central nervous system sensitivity to physical emotional or social stimuli Some refer to this as having sensory processing sensitivity or SPS for short I feel like this description of HSP may resonate with people with BPD What especially strikes me is that sensory processing sensitivity is often mistaken for anxiety pickiness or a personality flaw or um like a whole personality disorder BUT HSP might ve served an evolutionary purpose of increasing cautious behaviour in our species which allowed a higher survival rate Also 1 in 5 adults are HSP IMO people with BPD are likely HSP who grew up in environments that invalidated our sensitive natures and didn t teach us how to self soothe or navigate the world while accounting for our sensitivity I found all this info from various sources online and I hope y all find this useful Some tips for HSP 1 Identify your triggers 2 Plan ahead in anticipation of triggers and work around or avoid them could be loud environments tight deadlines abrasive people hot and cold partners 3 Incorporate routines into your day to day 4 Avoid high stress fast paced jobs your mileage may vary 5 Treat yourself often to comforting activities 6 Notice when you are triggered and set up self soothing techniques Practice those techniques,Safe/Neutral
Im so proud of all of you BPD is more than just hell on the mind it s without a doubt one of the hardest mental illnesses that doesn t get the awareness that it should have but im proud of all of you because of the determination you carry of pushing through on the days where you just feel like not even getting out of bed for celebrating the smaller victories you find and accomplish to all of you I sincerely thank you for never giving up for fighting on and even when you feel out of control you still came back you still are here and you ll be here tomorrow and the next day and the next week and the next month and the next year im so proud of you please never lose hope and always know that support can be found and will be given youre never alone and heres hoping to brighter day for everyone who reads this or needs to hear this,Safe/Neutral

In addition people with BPD quite often have a weak self concept They don t always know who they really are deep down inside They may always feel like there s something missing or something wrong with them intrinsically This can cause periods of dissociation and difficulty in maintaining a healthy sense of self esteem They may have a weak value system or one that is missing entirely or find that they have a difficult time adhering to whatever value system they do have Since there s a real issue with trusting and black white thinking they don t always trust in their own decisions and may do things to get people to like them or not leave them that would be against their value system normally and think that they themselves are terrible bad evil people for doing it later They often take their mistakes in life much more seriously than other people A normal person may make the same mistake and feel bad about it but it s unlikely that they will see themselves as terrible bad evil for having made the mistake Oftentimes a person with BPD would make that mistake and internalize it as a personal failure that it happened because they themselves are awful bad wrong This means that their self concept is much more fluid than normal people Now please keep in mind that not all BPD sufferers have every single one of these symptoms There are definitely other symptoms that can be included in the diagnosis but this is a pretty good start and the most common symptoms sufferers may face People with BPD need intense therapy because they must change how they see themselves and the world around them having a more mature realistic viewpoint of the world that isn t all black or all white rebuild value systems and self concepts that may be missing aberrant build the ability to trust others self and learn coping mechanisms DBT Dialectic Behavioral Therapy was developed for BPD sufferers initially and has shown some positive results for sufferers who adhere to the techniques in their lives Here s the thing too It s fairly common for Bipolar and BPD to be comorbid in a person meaning they have both at the same time We don t necessarily know if there s a genetic link between them but we are beginning to think that s possible A person suffering from both at the same time untreated would tend to be extremely emotional moody hypersensitive to criticism untrusting self damaging with highs and lows in behavior that make their lives and the lives of those who love them quite difficult They are chaotic because their brain isn t working correctly due to chemical imbalances and at the same time their perception of themselves other people and the world is one based on distrust and fear of being abandoned or rejected They tend to have problems with love relationships friendships family relationships and relationships with coworkers Quite often they end up being in the hospital for suicidal ideations or for mania more often for depression than mania It s not uncommon for them to end up in the system for some time before they get a proper and correct diagnosis and a good treatment plan They may get kicked out of the system early with a misdiagnosis which leads to poor management of symptoms and relapsing,Suicidal Reference

Distraction When I get like this I am my own worst enemy What I find best is to take myself out of my head until the phase passes Last Christmas I was the same way I was done Sounds stupid but I coloured every time the thoughts overwhelmed me The distraction allowed me time out of my own head until the adjustment in meds kicked in Please know that the world is NOT better off without you xxx,Suicidal Reference

Unfortunately there are some idiot therapists Took me years to find the right fit You mustn t give up If you are feeling severe anxiety please go to the emergency ward at the closest hospital Tell that you have had suicidal thoughts and feel overwhelmed and unsafe They will admit you even if it s overnight Usually a psychiatric nurse or doctor will assess you and give you out patient information Stay safe Hugs,Suicidal Reference
Ethan do you have a close friend a relative or a counselor that you can turn to in times of trouble You should likely have a personal safety plan prepared meaning you have someone to go be with when you feel especially depressed vulnerable or suicidal You definitely need to be seeing a doctor for your bipolar disorder if you aren t already It s an illness that needs to be medically treated You definitely can t change that by yourself It s like thinking that if you had cancer or diabetes you could just change it by wanting to or thinking hard enough about it That s not how it works You probably know that bipolar disorder is usually caused by chemical imbalances in the brain You need medications to help with getting your brain chemistry back on a healthy midline for you Your depression is probably causing you to have pervasive thoughts and thought loops just in case you don t know what that is as many people wouldn t that s when you get the same awful negative thoughts and memories playing over and over in your mind You try to get away from them but they often are intrusive and disturbing Depression is BAD about causing those You sound like you might also have a bit of PTSD from being bullied All of those things can be treated well and effectively You need to see a doctor If you are really thinking of running away or doing anything damaging to yourself please seek out help at a hospital There are people who can help you and who will care for you And Ethan I know this may be hard for you to believe right now but you NEVER deserved to be bullied You didn t ask for it The bullies were the ones who were 100 in the wrong and NOT you Please do not take to heart anything they may ve said about you Bullies deliberately try to find something to hurt their victims with Quite often they seem to know exactly where our vulnerabilities and insecurities lie and attack us there Here s the thing they re in the wrong and I m sure the things they said about you were cruel awful and negative I don t know you personally but I do know that no one and I mean this NO ONE deserves to be treated like that Please don t let them keep bullying you even now in your mind Whenever those thoughts and memories come back into your mind try to confront them Try to explain to yourself why those things were incorrect or why those people were wrong about you Rebuild your inner strength by focusing on all the GOOD that I m sure exists in you and all the good you ve done in your life Those bullies didn t know the real you the one deep inside Only you and those closest to you really know you So don t let these bullies and their stupid hatefulness steal another moment of your life from you Please get yourself some help for your bipolar and depression Those can be treated and you might find all those negative thoughts and memories eventually fade with treatment You have only my very best wishes for a better future,Suicidal Reference
I am a recovering self harmer I see it as being like an alcoholic You are never really over it First of all I strongly encourage you to seek out a crisis hotline in your area Please therapy can really help For more immediate relief I used this method and it will sound weird squeeze ice cubes They give a burning sensation which gives you that pain feeling but doesn t have a lasting injury And the actual physical force of squeezing them released tension and stress for me I hope this helps I would also draw what I wanted to cut instead of actually cutting,Suicidal Reference
Hugs I also struggle with self harm and suicidal thoughts I wish I knew how old you are so I could try to help,Suicidal Reference
First off you need to report your boss Nobody and I mean NOBODY in the authoritive position should be using words of profanity much less belittle any employee Go as high up the chain of command until you find someone who will listen and investigate it Record it and send it via email if you have to As for you re seeing a therapist GO I can t stress that enough It s not anyone around you whose life is at jeopardy It s YOURS You need professional help There should be some kind of hotline for crisis you can call on yourself If not go to the emergency room Please do this for yourself Your life matters and you matter Get some help now I am not a cutter but I do understand as I know people who have cut on themselves The feeling of trying to escape from the pain inside only to project that pain on the outside as a means of escape You can message me any time you need to Just get that help you are desperately crying out for before it s too late,Suicidal Reference
Hes saying bullshit Not everyone has depression He doesnt understand anything I have depression and anxiety since basically I could talk and I know how hard it is to fake a happy act I get rages from my Intermittent Explosive Disorder and cutting is the only thing that calms me down Also I cut from guilt costing money and feeling such a burden Ive been trying to stop but it s not working it s just who I am If your friends won t accept that I m here for you Drown yourself in fav music You arent worthless to me Stay alive for me I don t want you to die I ve been suicidal since 8 yrs old that was my first attempt and last year I basically died My body wasn t functioning and I was walking around out of my body I was terrified pls stay here for me 3,Suicidal Reference
I ve dealt with self harming too in more ways than one I purposely bruise myself to relief anger and hate yet at the same time how much hurt I feel for even existing I also deal with more suicidal thoughts more frequently and hell I m only 17 My mum wasn t supportive at first she constantly yelled at me for even the smallest things and my doctor and psychiatrists say that it s just a way of attention seeking and is greedy because it s causing more pain for others than myself I personally feel that no one understand the amount of emotional pain the smallest things effect me My mum only noticed how bad my mental state had gotten when I attempted suicide and kept telling her how much I wanted to die At first she just told me it was teen thing as did the doctors But then I was diagnosed with clinical depression however I feel as if it s more than depression because I have traits of bipolar too I didn t self diagnose myself I know others that are bipolar and they say some of my symptoms are like theirs too Now dear I know it s hard and I m sure many of us have been in your situation before but just know you re not alone in any of this yes people will judge but that shouldn t determine who you really are No one knows you better than yourself Don t let others drag you down and I think your mother should come to some sort of understanding that you re suffering with some mental issues sorry if that comes along rude or anything like that but instead of yelling at you she should comfort you reassure you and so on and not yell In my personal experience after cutting my wrists and thighs I felt terrible guilt and I wanted to stop so badly but didn t want to feel nothing because cutting myself made me feel something I still wanted to stop so what I did was I d get an elastic band or hair band and keep it around my wrist and just ping the hair band elastic band onto my wrist or arm as hard as I could and it may leave a red mark but it won t scar or anything Take deep breathes too 5 seconds inhaling 7 seconds exhaling and continue until you feel okay Crying is also okay to do you re human so it s okay to cry If you feel alone remember you re not alone There are people out there who are just like you whether you know them or not It ll all get better eventually I assure you sweetheart I hope my words have some sort of help for you And I m sorry also if I made it seem all about me I just wanted to show you that you re not alone,Suicidal Reference
Mental illness is so misunderstood by the average person who does not have it or knows anyone close to them who is dealing with it I hope you are talking with a psychatrist or therapist They can put u in touch with the right kind of therapy Sometimes you are the kind of person that can not hold down a job where other ppl are involved with your daily activities If your mental health is taking over all your work time and home time I would suggest you should seek out ssdi or ssi benefits You need more counseling and therapy for yourself You need to work on yourself right now The stress of work is maybe to much right now The psycharist will help explain why u cut and how to get another outlet instead of harming yourself If your work is making you turn to doing this you need to stop going there I know it s easier said then done Try to work on what i said earlier in this post The less stress for you would help alot You cannot change how other ppl perceive you or what they think And thats ok You have to take care of yourself right now You can though remove yourself from these situations where you won t be mocked or where they just don t understand it If u are living with your mom Go to a psycharist at the states financial help Every state has a program for low income If u leave your job I know it will be hard but seems like you need to start with a psycharist Doing what you are doing everyday is not getting u anywhere Try something different by the suggestions i would take Sorry your mother is not more supportive Some ppl are incapable of understanding it sorry to say Even family Hope this helps God Bless,Suicidal Reference

I currently struggle with this and have for over 20 years I also think DBT is a great way to go as far as learning new coping skills when you can get the help Personally I have found that drawing on myself with red markers or squeezing ice helps a bit Sometimes if I have old clothes I don t wear anymore I slash or rip them I used to pick up henna kits because it s kind of like making scabs I hope you can get the therapy that will help you There are people who understand though I know it doesn t feel that way right now Depression lies to us that way Oh and a lot of people are posting the hotline which is great but if you re like me and uncomfortable talking in the phone there is a text line 741741 Big hugs and thank you for speaking up and advocating for yourself,Suicidal Reference

NOT everyone has depression Your boss is a twit Depression is an illness That s like saying that everyone has heart disease or diabetes He s an idiot About self harm Quite often self harm is caused by a need to have control in one s own life a feeling of helplessness that combines with depression for a very nasty mix It s time you got some control back 1 This is of the utmost importance Get a new job There s absolutely NO reason to put up with verbal abuse from an employer He should show more professionalism You shouldn t have to put up with it I know it s scary but you ll feel more in control of your life if you start looking for a new job I ve worked a lot in my life and I ve only ever had ONE boss who thought it was okay to cuss her employees First time she did it to me I quit that moment Please don t put up with that crap It s apparent the job doesn t give you insurance so there s no reason for you to be there when you can find something better Maybe your next job shouldn t be as a customer service rep It doesn t seem to be a good fit for you personally especially at this point in your life Look into doing things you d love instead 2 FRIENDS don t just run away when things get rough TRUE friends will do what they can to help you Maybe it s time you assessed the people you have been hanging around You need to find new friends real ones but you can t do that until you get your depression under control 3 Go back to church There has to be like the little volunteer lady or the Pastor or his wife or someone who is known for being compassionate Talk to them If nothing else ask to talk to your pastor for spiritual counseling It s free and it might help you somewhat if nothing else you d have someone to talk to for a bit about what you re feeling 4 Check into local mental health resources that might be available for cheap or free in your area There may be a support group you can join You don t have to be alone Depression is an ILLNESS It is systemic It starts in the mind but it s not long before it takes control of the entire body You need to have it treated like you would if you had pneumonia or diabetes or any other serious illness You d go to the doctor for it If you must go to an ER If there s a charity hospital in your town go to their ER You desperately need to be treated for your depression You might need medications Depression is often caused by chemical imbalances in a person s brain You can t sleep it off It doesn t work that way That d be like telling the person with diabetes a chemical imbalance dealing with the pancreas that they can just sleep it away That s not how any of this works If you take nothing else from my post please remember this Depression is a LIAR It lies to you about your worth your own abilities your life and the people who love you It tells you that no one cares It says that everyone hates you or that they d be better off without you It whispers that you will never be good enough or that you ll never amount to anything or your dreams for your life will never be fulfilled These are LIES It says the same type of things to every sufferer Those lies play like a broken record in your mind You need to get away from them Medication and therapy would do a lot for you If you re cutting a LOT you may need some hospital time It would definitely make people in your life take you more seriously when you say that you re sick Don t kill yourself or anything like that please Keep reaching out There are people who will respond who are willing to be there for you The world is a big place with a lot of wonderful people in it who would help you care for you and be there for you Just keep trying,Suicidal Reference

First of all if your boss is using offensive words you need to go higher Is there a human resources department or a union rep or someone you can confide in That should not ever be something an employee goes through whether you re dealing with your own personal issues or not Do not believe what he said about venting That was entirely uncalled for If you have close friends or a family member or sibling you trust please PLEASE reach out People will surprise you That s one issue I struggle with my partner surprised me when I told him I had an episode this weekend he was genuinely worried and told me to call him next time he s away for work Do you draw or have any extra curriculars artistic talents or other hobbies What about something like ripping paper when you get the urge to cut Have you seen a doctor or psychiatrist counsellor I encourage you to add that to your list it won t solve your problems but having that unbiased person you can talk to may help you make the changes you need Please find the emergency numbers for your area there s several online resources you can even do online counselling if you re worried or not up for face to face I hope you know you are not insignificant You re someone s child friend and so much more The negative thoughts are one voice right now they re just much louder than the positive voice Take care and hugs,Suicidal Reference

I can t seem to make Wikipedia email work so I ll respond here You asked how did I come to create Mike Hawash and why come back to it a year later not sure how to answer that I must have either followed a red link or created it in response to some news item I saw I came back to it later and added what appeared to be mostly uncontroversial information until I was attacked I think the edit logs will show this You also ask how I can edit from IP addresses all over the world Again I do travel for my work now but I have no knowledge of how the dial up system I use iPass chooses where it logs into I don t see how any of this is relevant Other than using a dynamic IP address I don t see what I have done to deserve this treatment P s I noticed on Wikipedia Signpost that a case involving someone with dozens of sockpuppets just received probation how do you justify pre emptory banning in this case,Emotional Distress

There is no reason to delete this Why am I being persecuted by a group of people here on everything I add I am working on more info to post and this is just the start,Emotional Distress
SC Info Im almost positive that this is not the place I m supposed to be responding but there is no reply link at your message Part of the reason for my offense is that I think your being unfair in referring to it as spam If I was just posting Hey Come visit my site without any contribution that would be one thing But when I posted anything from my own site I had news attached to it You didn t have a problem when I posted the news of the departure of the producers and writers of the movie and linked to RopesOfSilicon com and you also didn t have a problem when I posted the purchase of Dreamworks by Paramount and linked to Yahoo News but when the news happened to come from my site even if it is legitimate news it s spam I happen to be in a position that I have connections and can make alot more news than other sites But that shouldn t make the news any less relivant in getting it to people When I take the time and care enough to try to make sure the info is correct only to have it removed and replaced by the same wrong information it s very frustrating and it does come back to us at Ubisoft For example someone came to the official forums and said they saw on Wikipedia that Tom Cruise had accept the role of Sam Fisher in the movie Well that is not true So I had to correct him and that has happened a few times with a few wrong pieces of information Which is why I went to the extent to find the correct info But if you are not in control of the other pages and judging by the fact that the incorrect info that I removed has been replaced it seems those who are in charge seem to perfer having incorrect information posted so my hands are tied Frankly I m getting tired of trying to help and getting railed back for what I see as petty reasons everytime Also the back and forth with you removing my fan page from the list and the two other sites to the bottom only to have me move them back was something I did because I have problems with an owner of another fansite following me around and well not being nice I was thinking it was him that was removing the info,Emotional Distress
Thanks Ira User 64 you haven t said anything logical to which I can reply but if you do I ll be more than happy to give it a while You ve already been asked by another user to stop with the ad hominem If you can t take it please don t dish it out I am exhausted dealing with TAPS fans TAPS advertising TAPS lobbying ad infinitum,Emotional Distress

How is that With edits like this All I want is to be left alone in peace to get on with making wikipedia a better place and these users Hagiographer and Zapatancas seem determined to not allow me to do so If Hagiographer actually leaves me alone there will be no problem but calling me an outright liar isnt the way to go about it nor is to say he will ignore my opinions If this user isnt Zapatancas how come he hates me so much Nobody else does All I want is to be left in peacee I know you have the interest of wikipedia at heart so please can you support me in justy being a normal editor witrhout being harrassed,Emotional Distress

25 March 2006 UTC The opinions Tisthammer is insisting on adding are NOT about Josephson OR about Natasha Demkina They re about Profs Hyman Wiseman and me Josephson has nothing really to say about Natasha Instead he argues that we re a bunch of unethical crooks That appears to be why Tisthammer wants the link added And he doesn t care that it violates Wiki guidelines He says he s willing to compromise by allowing me to add a statement or two denying that we re a bunch of unethical crooks He calls that a compromise This is Tisthammer s idea of mediation Immediately take a side and argue for it by misrepresenting Wikipedia guidelines and the meaning of words like primary source Josephson is no primary source He s never met Natasha never tested her never spoke with her and his only personal knowledge of the Discovery Channel program comes from watching it like millions of other TV viewers He s no more a primary source than is Tisthammer himself If Tishammer wants to create a new Wiki article on Josephson s fights with skeptics he should do so and stop pretending he s a mediator There s much too much bilge in this discussion page already 13 39,Attacking Behavior
