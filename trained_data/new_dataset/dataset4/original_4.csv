"i feel like i'm spiraling again vent post bc i am so tired of my fucking brain! my depression and bpd have been kicking my ass lately and especially now. i feel like there's a hole in my chest and everything hurts so bad and nothing even triggered it this time. i wonder how other people wake up and actually want to be alive. i want to crawl out of my skin,rip out my hair and claw my face off. i feel suicidal every day and i am slowly drowning. that's all.",Suicidal Reference
"bpd and recklessness hi. i'm looking for someone to talk about sexual engagements with bpd. i used to struggle with sex for the longest time and mostly used it as a way to self harm myself. i would get really drunk and not feel much during it and feel empty and suicidal the next day. since this year i started to get more sexual active and it actually became quite the opposite now, i love to have sex but because i have intimacy issues i always go for one night stands. the problem is i still get really drunk before because i don't like opening up to someone when i'm sober and then almost always go for unprotected sex. if the guy doesn't think about it it would never come to my mind to ask to put a condom on. i don't want to. bu it's not that i'm unaware or careless, and i'm really scared of stds. it's just that when i'm having sex i want it to not be good for me. is there a way to control this impulse so that i can practice safe sex ? i don't want to be so reckless anymore. i'm always so ashamed of my own behavior but then fail to stop myself from making the same mistakes. i feel like such an idiot. my friends tell me to just stop but it's like when i'm in a situation like that i have a whole different mindset and thrive for dangerous behavior.. in every aspect",Suicidal Reference

"is my partner being protective or controlling? i'm the one with bpd. to make the story short, i'm on a cocktail of drugs that could be fatal if taken in large amounts. i tried an overdose attempt in 2014 that didn't succeed (obviously) but haven't done anything relating to pills or suicide since, although i have had a few psych holds. my partner keeps my pills locked up and refills my pills every week. i've told her i don't like them being locked up, it makes me feel like a child, i'm not going to do anything, and i've been pushing more to have them kept out. she says it hasn't been an issue before and there isn't a reason to keep them out since they're safe locked up. every time one of us grabs the refills they go straight into the box. i wish they would just be left out and i could dispense my own meds. i'm not going to overdose...these are important meds that would cripple my ability to live life normally if i lost them; my disease would come back and that's not something i'm going to play with. but i just hate feeling like a goddamn child. i just turned 30 and i feel like my permission has been taken away because i didn't play nicely. after i broke glass to cut myself in 2017, she hid all the ceramic dishes in the home and required i move all foods purchased in glass containers into plastic containers, and i needed to ask her for permission to use a ceramic dish so i could microwave something. like...i get it. she's worried about her mentally ill partner and is trying to keep her safe. but this also feels extraordinarily controlling.",Suicidal Reference

"bpd, anger, crying, disassociation? executive functioning? anger issues? disassociation? help! hey everyone! so i' amm diagnosed with adhd as well as anxiety. i'have also been told i have anger issues but not officially diagnosed. one of my psychologists think it's an emotional regulation thing but idk? i'm just wondering if anyone else experiences this. normally i'm someone who's anxious and avoids conflict, but every once in a while i get extremely triggered by something and i can't control myself. i'will start crying hysterically and screaming, having really negative thoughts, and i basically turn into a different person and i feel completely out of control and it's actually very scary for me. also this is usually about something that happened that's annoying and not something really bad. the thing is that this will go on for hours. it took me 10 hours and basically 3 hours of running to calm myself down. when it's happening i can say to myself ''i know this is illogical and it's not a big deal' . but no matter what i do, nothing helps and i start freaking out at anyone around me (to a really scary level). now that i'm old enough i basically have to make myself stay in my room or go outside during this because it's insanely embarrassing. i basically switch to a different person and say things that i would never say normally and could even get physical because of how angry i get. the next day i'm always so ashamed. also i'have had this ever since i was little. since being on adhd meds it's become less frequent. i also try taking xanax when it happening and it doesn't help unless i take enough to knock myself out. im not asking for diagnosis or anything but i'm just wondering if anyone with bpd also has these symptoms? thank you so much!",Emotional Distress

i don't think i can go on anymore long post. i went through a break-up. we'd been together since early 2020 except for some time off towards the end of last year. she cheated during the relationship this year but i stuck on. it was very very rocky but we stuck on. she would go without texting me for days in the middle and one day she brings the topic of us breaking up up. i finally caved and said okay and we ended things. i tried initiating contact a week later and asked her to get back with me but she wouldn't. she told me that she wants to move on and that she just 'fell out of love'. i have a bad habit of triggering myself and today seems like the last day i can take this anymore. the thought of her with someone else is killing me and this is a pattern with me and my past relationships too.

"warning: autistic women are often misdiagnosed with bpd i was diagnosed with bpd at a university clinic 8 years ago. i met all the criteria except unstable relationships - i have mostly stable relationships, there are some people i've stopped being friends with over the years but not more than usual. i also don't date after a 10 year emotionally abusive relationship. recently, at age 45, i was diagnosed with asd 1. this came about because i had my whole genome sequenced and had many genes associated with autism - plus my dad and brother are both engineers which is a risk factor in and of itself. so i was referred for an evaluation, and it was immediately obvious to the evaluator that i was autistic because of how i played as a child and that i was an early reader/talker (this is a common marker in autistic females). reading more about women with autism, i discovered that self-injury, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation (as well as death by suicide) are all consequences of being autistic and having to try and hide it (masking) as well as living without any accommodations. i posted here before about [achieving remission from bpd]( thanks to good therapy. while it definitely helped me with attachment issues/cptsd that i also have, it looks like what has actually helped the most was going into lockdown, which instantly took away all the sensory and social stressors that had been burning me out all these years. so, if you are a woman diagnosed with bpd, with an atypical or 'quiet' presentation, it could be worth it to research autism in women online and see if there is anything you relate to. i feel like i could have been saved almost a decade of pain if i'd been diagnosed correctly, as this self-knowledge has taken away the self-hate that tortured me all my life.",Suicidal Reference

"my situation i have been intensive therapy for more than two years. at first, my therapist diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, but then later she said that i had bpd. it's been difficult dealing with this, in part because after reading about bpd, it seems that most therapist regard you as treatment-resistant, and many don't want to deal with you. that added to my sense of hopelessness and deep despair. on top of all this, i began to develop a strong attachment to my therapist, and eventually i fell in love with her. i fell *hard*. i wrestled with telling her this. but finally, i did. her reaction was clinical. she wanted to discuss why i felt the way i felt and all the other things that therapists bring up. and in no way did i ever sense that she looked at me as anything other than her patient. but that didn't stop my feelings, which now pervade my life. i've considered many times quitting. but the thought of never seeing her again seems devastating. she has always said things like, 'i'm not going anywhere' and 'I'm here for you,' and i'm certain she said this to quell my feelings of abandonment. then a few weeks ago, i got so incredibly dark and depressed that i truly felt i'd reached the end. i had no one to turn to, so i contacted her through email, telling her how bad i was feeling. she called me straight away, and talked me down. she really saved me in that moment. but then at our next session she sort of ambushed me, saying that she felt she could no longer deal with my case, and that i should find another therapist, but i could stay with her until i transitioned out. i completely broke down when she said this, and literally begged her not to walk away. the session came to end and it felt like things were up in the air. then she went on what was a planned vacation. i'm set to see her again later today for the first time in a few weeks. i'm terrified.",Emotional Distress

"is it possible to have both anxious and avoidant attachment style? i'have known for a while now that i have an anxious attachment style but i never really took the time to read up on avoidant attachment style until earlier. i relate to a lot of what i read. for one, i read that avoidant attachment style can form from rarely receiving affection from your parents. i can count on my hands the number of times my mom hugged me or praised me for anything. i also read that if your parents discouraged you from showing emotions that's another way that can form. my mom use to threaten me and my siblings when we would cry. we weren't allowed to express sadness or anger. then i read about how this can show up in adulthood. avoiding making friends, having a hard time taking criticism,uncomfortable when being touched,fear that being in a relationship will cause harm, etc. i relate to all of these things. so i was wondering if it's possible to have both depending on the situation. like i tend to avoid making new friends but the ones i do have i always fear they will abandon me ( anxious attachment style) and there are certain times i enjoy being close to people. it just seems to me it depends on the situation.",Emotional Distress

"struggling to do therapy homework hello' my therapist gave me some homework, a behaviour skill diary and a chain analysis worksheet.

"beware of getting too comfortable with self-depreciating - suicidal jokes this post is inspired mainly by 'bpd memes' you can see on instagram or other subreddits. talking about our struggles and feeling that we are not alone in our pain is important. there is a line though, in which what initially started as a coping mechanism to laugh about something tough, evolves into cheering each other on as you hammer unhealthy concepts deeper into your mind. reinforcement is the process in which a behaviour, through the consequences it entails, becomes more frequent. that reinforcement doesn't need to be something that feels good. a lot of thing that we don't like that can act as a reinforcement for our behaviour. there are many things that can act as reinforcement and for what some of us x will be reinforcement, for others won't. but there is a universal reinforcement: attention. not positive attention, any attention. with anything that we post on the internet, the likelihood of producing the same type of content increases if we get attention in form of likes, praise or karma. you can see this trend from tiktokers that reproduce the same joke over and over again with different people because that one video got viral or folks that talk about politics on twitter who end up being monothematic. words have power. don't poison yourself with words. you are not worthless. it's worrisome the amount of memes that emphasize the false idea that there is no hope for your future and that you are damned beyond repair. *(I'm not, by any means, trying to invalidate how someone expresses their pain. my point is that if you are someone who has been consuming that type of content for quite some time, i want to encourage to seek other healthier sources of support - being seen)*.",Suicidal Reference

"just a thought just wanna state a few things first, so i don't really know the difference between bpd and bipolar (or at least which ones i struggle with) and maybe i'm just overly cocky because i overcame my depression and suicidal thoughts but i think the cure for bpd is building confidence i mean if you think about it, it's a cycle, just like depression. when you're depressed you have no modivation to do anything, and not doing anything makes you more depressed for bpd you feel 'too much', and then get insecure, hurt people, which then validates and fules the insecurity. and so the cycle continues. and now i'm not saying a few 'oh don't worry, we all love you' or 'yeah i'll never leave you, i promise' is gonna fix anything, though it helps. it's going to take years of cbt to reprogram our minds. figure out each and every insecurity, find out the source most likely it'll be some sort of childhood truama. find that voice, there will be 2. one that you need to listen to and heal, and one that you just need to tell fuck off. it's kinda hard to differentiate. but it's also hard living without being able to connect to people, your choice and for anyone out there who doesn't want to recover because they feel like their bpd is a part of them, hear this. it is a part of you, that's why you developed bpd, rather than the other personallity disorders. but you have to realize it's gone to far, you can get better and still keep all the best parts of you",Suicidal Reference

"i'm unsure if i have bpd for starters i'm not self diagnosing at all, i also have never been to therapy nor gotten an official diagnosis for anything. i'have thought long and hard about this and i'have also done my research the best i could and i believe i could have bpd. for a very long time i'have gone through many friends and ended up absolutely adoring them for the first few weeks/months only to end up ghosting them or getting into large fights over nothing that will end our friendships. i'm not sure why i do this, i can't really remember if something happened and it caused me to just want nothing to do with them. i also have a hard time with relationships/friendships when it comes to someone i really like. what i mean by this is after i hang out with them i can't get them out of my head for the next week. i constantly go through a cycle of, they love me and will never leave me to they' are going to leave and i end up wanting to hurt myself or become dramatic about it. i don't do this on purpose but it's my first reaction to things. i'have also begun to notice that i'm becoming more angry and impulsive. i'have started being more physical and verbally angry over small things like not being able to find something i misplaced or if i feel i'm being neglected in a way even though i'm truly not. i'will end up destroying many things and become very sad and depressed. i'have noticed that i don't think before i do things, for example like sex without condoms, constant drug use, going out and being reckless. these are just things off the top of my head. sorry it's kinda long. anyways, any opinion would be helpful so please be honest about what you think.",Emotional Distress

"cant move on from a break up so almost a year ago a broke up with my bf. it was a long distance relationship. i loved him very much. the thing is, he have me his old phone and saw some pictures and conversations i wasnt meant to. basically since the beginning of the relationship he was inviting other girls out and flirting with them over ig. i told him what i saw. kind of brushed it off, but it never left my mind. so sometimes i lashed out on him. then more things happened, like he shared instagram stories with past flings of him, and that made me very upset. and i never got over it for real sometimes i still lashed out on him and felr very insecure about it. at some point, i think i was too needy and he broke up with me, but he kept on talking to me, and of course, i didnt want him to leave me so i didnt cut off communication. eventually we came back together. but onlt for a while, because at some point i found out he had invited a past fling out for a beer, and that broke my heart and my trust. so i broke ip with him. after that i started taking meds, but didnt cut off communication, so he would talk to me, and then disappear, and then id lash out on him terribly. now he doesnt talk to me at all and has blocked me on very thing. part of me feels awful and anxious that he hates me and that i hurt him. but another part feels like i couldnt put up with that behaviour of his. i contacted him a month ago to say im sorry for mt behaviour, but then i saw he still talks to the girl he invited out, and i lost my shit and lashed out again :/ he said i hurt him a lot, abd that my emotional reactions are horroble for him. normally my relationships with people are stable. but this one with ny fp wasnt. and I'm not sure if it was my bpd or if it was a normal reaction to all the disrispect from his side. its been a year, and i really miss him. and im so sad we will never see each other again. :( i feel very lost. he has most likely moved on. i havent.",Emotional Distress

I'm doing the work but i'm not getting better. back to the breakup. it was a mostly healthy relationship and the first time i felt physically and emotionally safe with the person i was with. it took a while to open up and trust him, but eventually i did. the reason he broke up with me is complex, so i won't dive to deeply into it. i guess it doesn't really matter anyway. i just keep hoping that he'will text or call and apologize and want to get back together. rational me knows that this is not going to happen, but despite that, the hope and sort of desperation for him to reach out is still there. i don't know what response i'm looking for. i guess i needed to vent to people that understand bpd or maybe have gone through similar things. how do you guys get over serious relationships ending?",Suicidal Reference

"anger and hating everyone how do you deal with just being intensely angry at everything people do? for some background, my fp recently decided to cut me out of her life because i started showing symptoms. it was an understandable decision on her part, but it's frankly pissing me the fuck off because we'd gotten along really well and been pretty open with one another up until i started to spiral... i was hoping we could at least talk about it and salvage some form of friendship, but she was uninterested in that and chose to disappear instead. that's her choice. the same day, i went to one of my online friends and he got mad at me because he perceived i'd been overconfident about the situation with my fp to begin with. so he cut me out of his life as well. i've tried my hand with other dating prospects and seeing if i can meet other people than my fp, but it's been months without any real success. kind of understandable given my mental state, but with all these experiences combined i'm honestly just feeling lonely, bitter, and jaded, and i can see where it's bleeding into other aspects of my life. little things from other people just piss me off and i seriously want to go gorilla mode and just tear everything around me to pieces in a fit of rage. ideally, i wouldn't get here, and i know there are steps to take to not get here... but right now i'm here and i don't know how to properly get out. i have plans with friends later and it'd be nice if i weren't irritable and negative the whole god damn evening. what do you when you need to get out of a sour mood? i went to the gym yesterday, so i won't go today, but i still want to go gorilla. yes, i know i'm longwinded.",Emotional Distress

I'm not responsible for what lead to me having bpd however if i want change or improvement weither i like it or not I'm responsible for that i'm not owed anything because i have it. what i feel and how intensely i feel it i can't control however neither can other people, i will walk away from a conversation or shut off my phone because simply I'm not capable of a healthy conversation when i'm like that, it will do more harm than good my mood is not constant it will change and when it does not having to constantly pick up the mess i made makes the fluctuations much more managable and bareable.",Safe/Neutral

"bpd is so frustrating because it's your responsibility to fix something caused by other people i didn't wake up with this, i wasn't born with this, i wasn't genetically bound to have it. it was something that developed as a direct result of being treated horribly by people that were supposed to protect me. it was a result of being taken advantage of, abused, and neglected. i didn't wake up on morning and decided at 9 year olds i was going to try to kill myself. i didn't want to or choose to sleep with 30 year old men at 13. i didn't choose to eat myself into a coma because of the awful mood swings, to compulsively lie, to disassociate to the point i didn't know who my own mom was, to self harm so i had one thing in my life where i decided what i felt and how i was harmed. i didn't want to try to commit suicide 5 times by the time i was 15. i didn't want to be on prescription meds and in therapy since i was 9. i didn't want to hurt others and lose control of my anger. i didn't want to be a problem child. i didn't want to go to residential when i was 12 or constantly be hospitalized or forced to be on home bound because i was a ''high risk student' . i didn't ask for any awful thing that has happened to me. i didn't want to be another statistic. people view us as monsters and narcissists because of our disorder, but the reason we have it is because of actual monsters who ruined children. and now we are stuck with the after math. we' are stuck with the hard work and all the awful things that come with bpd. and its stupid and it fucking sucks. that's all just wanted to get that off of my chest.",Suicidal Reference

"i feel so bad but i don't know why my girlfriend and i have been dating for 3 years and she was recently diagnosed with bpd 2 months ago. i love her more than anything but she is a very sensitive person and i messed up recently with telling something about an ex and my cousin that she wanted to know it had to do with some weird shit that my cousin and ex did in the past, i haven't talked to my ex in 5 years when we broke up after i told her on the phone she laughed but mainly i could tell she was uncomfortable so i try to move on with the conversation but before i can she says she wants to hang up for the night. i wake up the next morning early because she has a flight to new york that i know she was nervous about so i text her but she doesn't respond for a few hours and then i asked if she's there but she says the flight was canceled and that she doesn't wanna talk to talk and that she needs a break from me for a bit. i tell her i understand and that i'm sorry the entire night i had terrible anxiety i couldn't sleep i was just thinking if she was gonna break up with because of this but i refrained from texting her. unfortunately i couldn't take it any more and i told her just a minute ago that this hurts and she responded with ''i don't want to talk to youüò£üò£üò£' i lover her so much and i don't know why it's hurting me like this i wanna to communicate with her but i think it'will make things worse.",Emotional Distress

"holy shit i actually broke up with him! my story's probably the same as most of yours - long string of partners who were absolute trash human beings throughout the years, mostly i was the one dumped once i stopped being of use to them, rinse, repeat. i can count the number of boyfriends i initiated a break up with on one hand with fingers left over, but finally at age 32 i stood up for myself. we were ldr and he came out to visit, fucked me a bunch, then left and pretty much faded me. he said it was work and all that stuff, didn't even leave me on read (he looked at my messages through his notification bar so it only said delivered) and if he did in fact speak to me on his own initiative it was once every few days. i tried to make it work, but enough was finally enough and i sent him a message basically telling him that he was treating me like rotten garbage, that i was sick of crying over someone who obviously doesn't care for me like he says, and that i would've loved him to the ends of the earth if he had been an actual partner to me. then i blocked him. i'm fucking free, yo! finally, after all these years, i actually decided i deserved better. i still think i'm worthless, of course, but i'm still worth more than that.",Emotional Distress

"having my borderline used against me... i don't know if this is just me but i have insane trust issues and as soon as someone lies to me i trust and rethink anything that ever happens or has been said with the person i'm with and i get super paranoid. i've been with a guy for 2 years and the lies and betrayal have ruined me and i don't even know if it's justified anymore cause i'm always so confused. ghats besides the point but i called out my partner for lying to me, i stopped trying for a while cause i was always told it wasn't true, but this time they said something that really hurt. for reference i don't lie really, i'll make excuses to not go somewhere or say oh yeah it's no big deal whejnim hurt but that's about it. anyways my partner (after months of begging them to look into bpd hoping the might understand and stop the yelling and insults and stuff) decided to say ''how am i supposed to trust a pathological liar?' i said what????? and he went on about how people with bpd are pathological liars, i asked him about what i've lied about and the most he could say is me saying i would go hiking but opting out the day of. it escalated into a fight but i just went home, hearing that hurt so bad. why would he say that?",Emotional Distress
"told my fp i was going to end it all, he ghosted me and we'have not spoke since we'have been friends for 8 fucking years, my life has really revolved around him this whole time. only 9 months ago though he told me he loves me, he wants me to be all his forever, he wants me to have his babies and us to buy a house and get puppies and all that. he's been telling me he's wanted nothing but to be with me for all these years and he's never going to let go now that he has me. we'have been unofficially together since then, exclusive to eachother, spending all our time together. i had a really bad episode last week and i was basically ready to end it all. i told him my goodbyes and that i would do it tomorrow. he literally didn't even bother replying. i waited a week to see if he' d care enough to check if i went through with it, he still hasn't. nothing. this happened before too. i told him i had od' d and he ghosted me for a week, i asked later why and he managed to convince me he just ''thought i didn't want anything to do with him because i didn't message' and he was just feeling insecure. yeah right. he called me crazy and ''out of control' but that he'will ''deal with it' . i guess i really just am too much to handle. i'have blocked him everywhere but i spend all my days crying because i still love him and miss him so much. i just wish i never told him anything but at the same time i feel like i need someone who's going to help me and not make me feel worse. ugh fuck bpd",Suicidal Reference

"helping my friend break up with someone so my friend has bpd and is in a not great relationship. i live with her and the guy, so i know that whats happening isn't her being 'crazy' or whatever and that he actually sucks as a person (like only be friends with my friends, i hate your parents so i don't want anything to do with them, you do all the chores but also do them better cause you do them wrong shit) i hate him so i'm definitely biased, but i think with good reason. he treats her like shit and i hear them fight all the time. unfortunately he's also very good at seeming like a caring person when he's fucked up enough that she threatens to leave him. he'll cuddle her and call her baby and stuff. me and her have talked a few times and she says its a logic vs feelings thing. logically she knows it's a bad relationship and she shouldn't put up with it. emotionally she doesn't want to let it go cause she still loves him and misses when he was nice and stuff at the beginning. normally i would encourage breaking up or just listen if she needed me to, but he's such a jackass and slob that i'm evicting him. i'm the only one on the lease and technically he should have moved out a month ago, but he wants her to go with him, so i've been giving them a bit more time so they can find a place, but she doesn't want to move out cause logic v emotions. i want her to live with me, but know it's ultimately her choice and all i can do is support her decision, but we're on a bit of a time crunch. is there any method anyone knows of for seperating feelings from a relationship faster? or does it just have to happen naturally. i really just want her to be safe, but also i need him out, like, yesterday. tdlr: my best friend is dating an asshole i'm evicting and doesn't want to move out with him but also can't seperate her emotions from him. is there a way to speed that up.",Attacking Behavior

"my boyfriend admitted he never loved me. so a few weeks ago i ended my first ever relationship to a guy living across the globe. we dated for almost 3 years and the relationship started when i was 17 and he was 26/27. we had a lot of ups and downs and my inability to be what he wanted/needed just got us to a horrible point. but i ended up being the one to end it all, in the beginning our relationship was very romantic, but we were also trying out loads of kinks and he would tell me how to make his fantasies happen, i fell for him hard. i was always bullied and my self-esteem was extremely low, so him calling me a goddess and seemingly loving all parts of me felt euphoric. but a few days ago (we had already broken up but agreed to be friends) he admitted to not caring about me at all and that the reason he wanted to be ' friends' was to get nudes and other sexual content from me. i was crushed, i had already thought i dealt with our break up pretty well despite not being in therapy or on medication, but him saying that i was just basically a sex object made me feel so dehumanized. he also proceeded to claim that i only talked with him because he was an attatchment of my bpd, and has made similar claims about my mental illness before. calling me a leech, a liar if things came up after promising him sexual content etc. i can't stop thinking about him nonetheless, since he made me feel so loved in the beginning. any tips on how to overcome thinking of him?

"this sub' it feels like some people just really come here and actually advertise the worst aspects of having bpd by refusing to believe they are the problem- or even *part of* the problem, and arguing (or completely losing it and sliding into dms to further argue) with any and everyone who suggests any rational solution or advice. i'm sure i'will be banned, but this is something i just keep seeing over and over again- daily' hourly' sometimes more. it blows my mind that people *looking for help and advice* refuse to believe anyone could be right besides them' !? i mean, *most* people take their time to give heartfelt advice or empathy to the situation' it isn't usually received well *at all.* i have lived with so many of the issues that come with bpd, and the wrong diagnosis (of bpd) for many years. it's not as if i'm out to hurt or upset anyone- but that's how any advice or recommendations are taken as' it's sad because (i'm not talking just about *my specific* advice) there is a lot of great advice given here, but it's constantly fought against. i feel so much for my husband and family and friends and therapists that dealt with me during those awful years where i just didn't listen to reason. i feel guilty, sad, shitty, and also thankful that they didn't give up on me and neither did i. so thankful. i'm thankful that while my bipolar has shown similarities to bpd, i opened myself up to the advice i was given by those who had walked the road before me, got the right therapists and doctors, got the right meds, and did dbt. i put my family and friends first always, and when i fuck up? i don't blame other people or my disease/disorder.",Emotional Distress
"nsfw - haven't felt like i needed this place in years hello everyone i was diagnosed with bpd when i was 21. i'm now 34. i thought i had sort of... overcome it? if that makes sense? like i knew it was still there but was able to control it for the most part through a combination of medication and a 12 step programme (for alcoholism). i've been off all substances, except my prescriptions, for three and a half years now, which is an incredible achievement for me. saying that, though, i seem to have gone into a downward emotional spiral the last few weeks. i can't tell if it's due to a change in a medication or if it's something else and the change is just making things that much worse. i've been engaging in self harm a lot in the last two weeks or so and am hating myself for it. i do it on my stomach so no one can see it but part of me wants to do it on my wrists, as like an attention seeking thing. i've been feeling fairly suicidal tbh. i've got numbers i can call in case of crisis and i've got my programme friends who are a big help, but i guess i wanted to come here because i feel less.. abnormal, i guess. i'm fighting the urge to manipulate people but then wonder if i'm doing it anyway without realising it. i don't know where i'm going with this, sorry. i just wanted to have a place where i feel more understood. the old thinking patterns are coming back. the impulsive tendencies. the manipulation. all the nasty shit associated with bpd which of course makes me feel like a shitty person. i've been talking to my gp and the local nurses at the psychiatric hospital who have referred me back to a psychiatrist, but of course that could take ages and i don't have the money to go private. so i have to wait and hope to hell i don't do anything i'll regret. anyway, sorry if this post is a little all over the place. thanks for reading.",Suicidal Reference

"can you feel love? hi, this is may be deleted at one point but i'm not sure when I'm not yet diagnosed with borderline but i'm almost 100% i have it. and it's killing me. it has been killing me all my life. it has affected my friends, my loved ones and myself. but you probably already know that what's concerning me right now, is whether or not i can feel love. right now, my girlfriend and i are on a one week break from one another. i'have been what i fee is an emotionally abusive asshole towards her. paranoid that she would cheat on me, that she would leave me. and before that, ever little thing i didn't like that she did, set me off. when it shouldn't have, and i know it shouldn't have. but it did anyways. and it always hurt me later to think about it. my question is: can borderlines feel love? i feel like i'have been such a manipulative piece of crap to her, and i just want to know if there's even any hope. i don't want to hurt her heart, she means so much to me but i'have been such a douche to her. i stared self reflecting so much, asking why i even love her. if i even do. i cried so much thinking about her gone. the thought of not seeing her. her smile gone, her heart to someone else. she can do as she pleases but it hurts me. do i love what she's done for me, or her as a person? how can i even tell? is she better off without me? can i fix us? maybe i'm overthinking.. i'm just so lost right now and would like some experiences and thoughts and advice, even. it hurts my chest and makes me cry and i'm desperate",Emotional Distress
"nervous about a break from weed i use weed to self medicate, it helps with so many of the symptoms and i can actually just exist for an evening.

"are you able to notice when your having a ''symptom' of bpd? i apologize if my question was weird. let me explain it in kinda a longer ish form. so i'm 16. I'm not diagnosed with bpd and i would never want to self diagnose. however- my therapist has brought it up before and so has my other therapist i had a while ago lol. my friend has also mentioned that they thought i had bpd. now while doing my research i found that most people with bpd dont know they have it. so i'm curious if this is actually true. let me explain. so i myself can tell when my emotions are going from happy to sad. i know that when i hate my friend i will most likely go back to loving them. i know when i get angry outbursts. and i also know when i get super attached to someone and can't leave there side. i'm very self aware. so to kinda short that, can people with bpd be self aware? are you able to notice when you have a drastic emotion change, even if you can't stop it, or notice when you become super attached to someone? i really hope my question wasn't offensive, and if it was i will gladly take this down. i'm trying to do more research for myself and i would never want to offend anyone ü§ç",Emotional Distress

advice please! so i have been on and off seeing this guy (current bf) for about seven ish years. recently we made things official and it started out well and then one day i just lost all feelings for him. i'm not sure why. i don't think it has anything to do with him but everything to do with me. i know people with bpd struggle with this but it hasn't gone away for me. when it hit me i instantly wanted to break up but decided to stick it out to see if i could come out of whatever episode i'm in and i haven't. it's making me feel really depressed and suffocated. he knows i have bpd and has been very supportive but i'm not sure how he would react if i told him how i was feeling. i don't want to keep him around if this is how i'm feeling. i feel like that would be unfair to him. i don't know what to do. do we talk? do i end it? how do i go about either?,Emotional Distress

any personality disorders similar to bpd or different levels/types of bpd? i've been reading a lot about bpd and can't help wondering if that's my issue. at least mildly. idk. gonnna keep doing more reading. so far i think i match up to a lot of things but maybe not to the extreme level ive been reading about. for instance; i've been irritable/angsty/wondered what's wrong with me for as long as i can remember i've always struggled with extreme emotions/outbursts. i've gotten better at hiding the outbursts over the years but they def happen. i'm pretty sure i have an fp. or always had one. everything has always felt like the highest high or lowest low with the person. chronic feelings of emptiness/boredom. yeah thats me its been interesting reading about ppl zoning out like i do. i have severe abandonment issues. and i've gotten better at not asking people if they're mad or love me or whatever. cause i know it pressures them. but it still pops up. if i don't hear from my person it eats me up inside. i've deleted ppl off social media trying to explain that i struggle when i see them having a life without me. out of site i can deal better but i get in my head otherwise. i sorta have self harming behaviors. they were more intense when i was 15-22. i dont self harm anymore but i use to burn/cut to feel something. ive always smoked weed to deal with irritability. currently i try not to drink very often cause it's been brought up by close friends i can sometimes get too emotional/go on tangents (about these feelings of emotions and abandkment) its too much to deal with. idk. any book recs or article recs or other disorder recs?,Emotional Distress

I'm suffering with troubles regulating my emotions and troubles in interpersonal relationships since a couple of years now (I'm 17), and it became even worse recently, especially during the first lockdown. the constant feeling of emptiness, the sadness, suicidal ideas or fear of abandonment are things that i know very well. i self-harmed a dozen times since april, and i have been seeing a psychiatrist (which prescribed antidepressants) and a psychologist since june. i sort of convinced myself that i had bpd because of the accuracy of the symptoms that applied to me, and i wanted to know if my self-diagnosis was right. yesterday, during my appointment with my psychiatrist, i told him i would like to put a word on my trouble, because i felt it would give a direction to dig in and a method to heal it. i felt he wasn't much into the diagnosis thing but he said to me that it is clear that i have borderline traits. i felt relieved and happy after he said this. it gave me hope. hope that, even if it is a long-shot, i will eventually feel better. i know it is not going to happen in just a couple of weeks or months, my psychiatrist said it would probably take years, but I'm optimistic. after leaving the room, i immediately thought of sharing my diagnosis here, with you, because this community has been very helpful to me since i discovered it. thanks for reading :)",Suicidal Reference

positives from labeling emotions? so this comes up a lot with me during both my group and individual dbt therapy. i really struggle to name emotions when discussing things. i have a really bad habit of bottling up emotions and also being really secretive and private which also makes it harder. so i usually just say something like 'i felt overwhelmed' but the therapists all call me out on that and really push me for more. we've gone through a little bit of it in group but not in much detail. i'm just wondering why it's good to label emotions or be able to name what i'm feeling in certain situations. i guess i'm struggling as i don't see why it matters or makes a difference. can anyone offer me some insight?,Emotional Distress

"friendship breakup gave me trauma i had that best friend whom i had to be apart for some other reason.

"the extent of bpd paranoia and delusions when anything begins going right, i get paranoid that it's going to go wrong. part of this is just trained response from consistent life experience. i get paranoid that people are going to abandon me, but the problem is that that paranoia is almost always validated, whcih only makes it stronger. i have legitimately been in places before where i believed that god does exist, and he is engineering my life in such a way that i will come close to a normal happy life, but never achieve it. i'd believe this as genuinely and deeply as any person believes jesus christ is their saviour and died for their sins and they will live again in heaven after death. the amount of hopelessness and despair that it lumps on top of you when you believe an unknowable and unappeasable entity is against you and how powerless you feel is beyond what i can describe but many of you might know the feeling. obviously this is beyond all versions of rational perspective, and i've never told anyone this. i hide all of this from friends and family because i'm that type of bpd that is mainly introvertive and most of the negative extremes are directed inwards at myself, except for perceived or real abandonment when i will absolutely lash out and snap at the person verbally in ways that are completely outside of all reasonable reaction. i'm currently finally seeking out proper therapy for it all, because i realized how out of touch with reality i would sometimes get.",Emotional Distress

I'm sort of in the process of slowly reconnecting with someone i was romantically-involved with a while back. things between us initially ended pretty poorly because we had no clue that *both* of us were struggling with bpd (and we also were not self-aware at *all*). just lots of bad communication and no accountability, honestly. we have spent some time apart working on our own healing, and assuming we start moving in the direction of dating again, i at some point want to have a conversation just so we can be upfront with each other and so we know exactly what to expect from each other in terms of communication, boundaries, triggers, etc. (i figure the fewer surprises, the better lol). i was just curious if you guys had any advice for navigating splitting in a relationship where both parties are capable of it at any moment. it's the one thing i personally struggle to cope with the most in terms of my own symptoms, so it sounds tricky lol. :( even in moments where i'm fully conscious of it as it's happening, it's sometimes hard to pull myself out of it. so i guess i just wanted to come here in the hopes that someone has had experience with this and has found a way to work around it. do you guys let each other know when you' are splitting? or do you intentionally avoid doing so for fear of possibly triggering the other person? is it better to just keep it under wraps and be as cordial as possible until you' are able to come out of it? or do you just ask for space? i'm pretty good at coping on my own, but i know it's going to be much different when both of us are simultaneously trying to navigate our own symptoms/triggers as well as learning each other's.¬†i'm a little lost, so any advice is welcome. :' )",Emotional Distress

"my girlfriend cheated on me and i don't know what to do *context * i was dating this girl who has bpd for 18 months completely long distance. she had plans to get her passport and make money to come visit me someday. she never made much effort to come visit me now that i think about it. she worked pretty often but never saved any money up, she would slowly spend it all the moment she gets her paycheck the more i think about it, the more i realize how many red flags i missed. *main * 2 months ago she wanted to take a break from the relationship to work on herself and be able to talk to other guys and make out with guys without feeling too bad if she got drunk. she said if she did talk to other guys, it wouldn't be anything serious. this break sounds very suspicious but i obviously cared about her mental health. i felt cornered into agreeing with it and i would be a bad person if i didn't allow her to have this break so i really only had 1 choice, which was to let her take this break. this break was supposed to last about a week but i think she officially announced the break to be over after around 2 weeks. fast-forward 2 months. last night which was national boyfriend's day, she tells me she had sex with another guy when she got drunk and was high during this break (not really surprised) and she wants to break up with me and take a break from relationships. i really wanted to trust that she wouldn't do anything with anyone and i convinced myself that i would believe that she wouldn't cheat on me. i'm heartbroken now. all my trust in her is gone, was that relationship all fake? did she really love me? she said 'i just wanted sex if im being conpletely honest, i was feeling empty and i think i used it as a form of self harm and sabatoge to myself '. i appreciate her honesty but is it really okay for her to just say ' theres something wrong with me and my brain'? what do i do? i love her but what she did was so messed up. do i forgive her? i don't know",Suicidal Reference

"i want to get to a place i feel I'm not making a mistake by failing to kill myself. i don't know if i like sex. i downloaded reddit again to post, even if i'm scared that posts are entirely meaningless. i don't know if i have bpd. i had a therapist say i have bpd, but he listed it as ptsd in hope i wouldn't deal with bpd stereotype issues. this was before c-ptsd was understood to the degree it is now. trying to deal with this while pushed around from one health care plan to another is a nightmare. his daughter was actually a musician in a band you likely associate with self injury. a current psychiatrist tried to narrow it down - i'm just a piece of shit, from what i can tell. lots of attempts at dbt though. i have lots of health issues. mental and physical. i'm a burden. 100%. let me stop being a burden. has anyone read the sorrows of young werther? for me one of the best books i ever read, and the professor described it as melodramatic but historically important. i haven't cut in a long time, but i want to, a lot - hours and hours of the night. i'm so tired. i haven't resumed cutting. but i'm a total alcoholic, since the start of covid, i guess. i don't even know how to ask for help. help? hospitalized three times for these mental issues. crushed on other patients every time. people i thought were friends each time. ghosted each time. i get it, but it really hurts! let's be friends! and let's have sex because we are friends!. I'm treated like shit for this perspective but people here know why i think that way. this is a rant - but if i can get any help by someone reading a rant, i welcome it! if i'm ignored, it hurts, but i understand. it's so tiring to try and be alive. i don't keep a gun around while that's what i want. the bridge is available if impulsive. push me one way or another. let me sleep in your bed. please, oh god, push me to suicide. that's what i want - i'm too wishy washy - i should take the plunge. but it scares me.",Suicidal Reference

"how to build a social sphere in mid to late 20s while recovering from bpd+bp2? so basically thanks to a combination of trauma and bad advice i'm 25 and have never had a friend group outside of fucked up trauma bonding and fps, and those are always separate from each other. i have a fair amount of online/distance friends and they're great and i love them but i'd love to have a social sphere of people to do stuff with (go to clubs/parties/clubs, try new things, exercise, etc) irl. i'm fairly high functioning socially, sometimes a little anxious and bad at returning texts while depressed, but enjoyable to be around and pretty funny (if also a tad dramatic). i'm steadily realizing that i was always more extroverted than i thought but couldn't act on that desire because of my mental illness, but now that i'm doing a lot better i genuinely don't know where to start. so what are your guys' recommendations? i already go to a running group every week but it's not super socializing (unless i'm doing it wrong i guess). i work at two jobs right now, one of which isn't very social with my co-workers (tutoring) and the other i'm not sure about but it doesn't seem likely to be (data analyst). my ideal would be a 'normal' friend group but i'm genuinely not sure how to start. has anyone else been in the same situation and gotten better? anyone got any useful tips?",Emotional Distress

"therapy session went super well. so, i feel the need to post this, because it could help several people... some insight: regardless of how i portray myself here on reddit, i haven't been feeling 100% lately. major slump, financial shit & relationship issues (communication). while speaking with my therapist, he said a few things... 1. even though, the goal is to fully heal from these mental illnesses, I'm allowed to feel emotions. we are allowed to feel angry, sad, disappointed, etc....etc. we are still human beings, and being able to feel emotions is a key component to a healthy life. 2. we have to figure out our limits. our boundaries. figure out how much we can change vs how much we can handle. if it's something we have to get done, take baby steps, ask for help, and pace ourselves. 3. most of us have said before 'i shouldn't be this upset, or i shouldn't be feeling like this. that in itself is setting a high expectation for ourselves, and it's super critical, which is unhealthy for our healing journey. 4. not everybody is going to understand what you are going through, don't take this as a sign that nobody cares. it's simply the fact that most people aren't equipped to understand, even if they tried. our triggers aren't their triggers, and they don't know how we feel, because they don't feel that way. we are essentially responsible for our own triggers, as hard as that may be. 5. nobody is perfect. we never will be. stop expecting that to be the outcome, because it's not going to happen. clearly, saying this has its exceptions. if someone around you is toxic, by all means, that needs to be dealt with, but you are good enough, and there isn't a single person who understands you, better than yourself.

"breaking up with a bpd partner? hi everyone. i hope this is ok to ask here. thank you in advance for your insight! i don't have bpd, but i do have cptsd. my partner has told me she has bpd. she is often suicidal, and i have depression which has significantly worsened over the course of our relationship. (i have before, but never this bad.) what i'm struggling with is: i can't be a support to her anymore with my own mental health in such a bad state, but i don't want her to think that she is a problem. i haven't told her about what i'm feeling because i'm too afraid of triggering her. she brings it up whenever i talk to her, and then i get so worried about her that i feel suicidal myself/responsible for her life. she has also made it very hard for me to take steps back from our relationship for my own health. i love her very much and i wish i could be a rock for her, but i'm not strong enough right now. how do end the relationship without hurting her? what should i say to her? side note, she also has been very controlling and manipulative, which makes me feel really unsafe, but she gets very defensive when i call her out on it. would someone with bpd act this way? i also want to say that though i don't know the pain of bpd, i appreciate you all as humans and fellow trauma-sufferers. it sucks when we want to be there for each other but have to take care of ourselves, too.",Suicidal Reference

"dae mirror so hard that they dissociate and lose their sense of self? i'm extremely socially anxious, so most of my interaction happens online. i go through 3-5 month cycles of hopping between different communities of people. like clockwork, the same thing happens every time. 1. i meet these people, realize i'm not like them, and mirror their characteristics, actions, and phrases to be as likable as possible. 2. it works for a while, then i dissociate from mirroring so often that i become a completely different person. 3. eventually i become unlikeable from how hard i'have tried to copy these habits and actions. it's almost like people catch onto my mirroring. it depends on the group of people, but the worse the group is as a whole, the worse i become. (i don't usually have a preference over good vs bad friends, because i'm so desperate for any sort of social interaction.) 4. at the end of these few month tirades, i get driven out of the group and bullied for my actions. these actions of mine are usually self destructive and awful. i apologize and take accountability, but it's usually not enough. this also stems from my innate need to be liked, and it feels like grief when i'm abandoned by people. i try to latch onto anything that's left from these relationships, even if i know they' are bad. i know there's things i can do better, like try not to let these people affect my character so much, and be as genuine as possible. it seems impossible though. it's not just ''be yourself' at this point, it's something madly complex and difficult to work around. i'm wondering if anyone has any supportive words, or even if anyone experienced this same feeling of mirroring + dissociation. i' d love any support or recognition that other people experience this too. thank you <3",Emotional Distress

"ouch my boyfriend is very nice to me, and he very rarely says anything hurtful but i feel so heartbroken right now. for the past 3 months he's been giving me so much attention and affection and i was feeling secure in it for a second there. there's this event i'm supposed to go to and without going in to too much detail, getting there is kind of a struggle. so he said 'don't worry about coming i'll have a great time with or without you' and emphasised how much he doesn't care whether or not i come. i know its probably just because he doesn't want me to feel guilty but hearing that hurt so much, especially since earlier he was saying how much he wanted me to come. we also have recently gone from talking/texting for almost all of our waking hours to only a little bit at night just before bed (we're long distance). his tone of voice has also completely changed, i'm sure other pwbpd will know what i mean when i say you can just tell when someone is no longer wrapped up in you. he went from hyperfocused on me to just kind of squeezing time in for me here and there, he doesn't have the same loving tone, he doesn't care what i do anymore, he essentially just spends time with me now if he doesn't have a better option. which is fine i guess but oh my god it hurts so much. i feel like abandonment is coming. and who knows, it may well be. I'm so hurt and so tired that i just don't have it in me to try anymore. if he leaves me so be it, i can't make him stay. I'm just hurting so badly, i feel like i'm not my favorite persons favorite anymore. it was my first time ever getting the same love i was giving back and it's gone now. i guess he's back to his normal self and thats good, but i feel so bad.",Emotional Distress

"vengeful god complex (dae have this?) something about myself that really scares me is how hellbent I'm on revenge and punishment for people that have hurt me. but it's not that i believe in karma or some external power, it's that i really believe myself to be the ultimate decider of what other people deserve. i have this huge inflated sense of justice. for example, my ex boyfriend lied to me and betrayed my trust a lot. i won't get into details but it was immensely painful and spanned on and off for 2 years. obviously my options were leave him, or stay and try to put it behind me. i invented my own 3rd option, which is to stay, but hold him emotional hostage. i basically took it upon myself to punish him for everything he did to me, became abusive, reminded him constantly of his wrongdoings, and genuinely believed that i have the authority to decide when it's enough damage (and from what i can tell, no amount of punishment and psychological abuse is ever enough to make me feel like there's justice). it's this insane god complex and it scares the shit out of me. it's extreme. i feel so strongly that if i'have been hurt, the only way to gain a sense of justice and fairness is to make the other person pay for what they did. surely this is something horrible, delusional people do? does anyone else feel like this, like if you feel victimized in any way you absolutely have to get revenge? and does anyone know why? or am i just a bad person",Emotional Distress
