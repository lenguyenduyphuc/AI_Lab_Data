"I'm in bed, wishing I had enough MJ to get me to sleep, but I know I don't. Not tonight. For tonight, ladies and gentleman, I will be sleeping alone. Which I just quite simply don't do. I haven't for a long time now. I miss him. Maybe. I really don't know. I'm confused, ashamed. Even though I moved out weeks ago, I've been staying at his house anyway. Just because. I made excuses like my new landlord doesn't like me and my bed sucked. Both were true, but neither of them meant I had to stay at his house. So, here I am, in my new room, in a new house, with new roommates and a new bed, and now I miss my boyfriend like a homesick 5 year old. Jesus. Oh yea, and I've been splitting like crazy (pun only kind of intended), and I spend most of my time on my phone now, whether it's reddit or fan fiction or whatever. We don't talk anymore, and it's because all I do is hide behind my phone. Hey, by the way guys, I'm kind of a mess so I hope you weren't expecting any well written shit.

":*Fair enough. I won't edit any more Vaughan-related articles, or participate in any Deletion Reviews, AfDs, RfDs and other related administrative procedures. I can't speak for Eyeonvaughan, only to say that it looks like the admins have him by the neck, and he probably can't get away with much. I also dislike the the previous day's vandalism on your page that probably that user arranged. The same is demanded from you, Pm_shef. No article related to anything political in Vaughan, no AfDs, RfDs, Deletion Reviews, talk page editing and vandalism, endless article edits and reverts. Right now my trust level in you is not especially high. I will not be tolerant towards mistakes... at least not now.

Maybe.. But I certainly tell you're an asshole. Its not like you couldn't read what the man said. Come up with something more original why don't you? What kind of camera is this? Its a good camera. Name that comedian : Kat Williams (: Making the legal driving age 21? The same age you become legal to drink? Yeah that's a good idea. Its Jay-z and Kanyes face put in one. But those are Kanyes eyes. So he is actually right. Am i the only one here who doesn't think these girls are acting stupid? Maybe its because me and my friends have done this multiple times but honestly they seemed pretty accurate to me. I'm pretty sure those tattoos are fake. And this isn't racist. I don't even see how it could be. How come the first couple of episodes are in english but all the rest have to be in english subtitles? I didnt realize Texans had an accent?

"My ex left a few weeks ago now and I just can't seem to leave him alone. All I feel at the moment is a crushing sense of dread that I'll never see him again. Maybe I won't, logically he's an ex right? But that just cannot seem to compute in my head. There's always some reason to text him, something that I need to say. I just want to be with him. It physically hurts. I know that some of this will be break up related, but honestly - it was going on for a long time before he left. Looking back into our relationship there were moments when the BPD was pushing him away massively (I regularly sat and cried for hours if he went out as I was so scared he'd never come back... ugh). I have no doubt that this behaviour contributed in some way to our split - and it will probably contribute to future relationship dissolution if I don't get a check on it. Just wondered if anyone had any better advice than my current path which is cry when I can't reach him, feel better when I do, silently dream that he might come back? :(",Emotional Distress
"About a year ago my doctor started me on fluoxetine for depression. In a later visit, she told me that she thinks I have BPD but she's not going to diagnose me. I didn't ask why. (If anyone knows of any possibilities why she wouldn't diagnose me that would be a great help) Right, so I asked to try amitriptyline instead of fluoxetine, as I read fluoxetine doesn't help depression in cases of BPD. She told me that she didn't want to due to the possibility of fatal overdose and she didn't think I was ready. (I had been suicidal before this point, however haven't felt that way for at least 2 months) About a month or two ago I stopped taking my fluoxetine to see if I felt any difference, and other than mad withdrawal I felt exactly the same on them as I do off them. I don't want to keep going back and asking for amitriptyline, but I want to know if they'll help. Any suggestions on how I would bring it up? I haven't been back since my last prescription of fluoxetine, which was about two months/three months ago and didn't talk to her about coming off them.",Emotional Distress
"I try so hard. I go to therapy twice a week, I do the workbooks, I check in with myself, I know exactly what I need to do to be a better friend/partner/person, and I want nothing more than to be that person but as soon as it comes down to it I throw all logic out the window and resort to manipulative, toxic, nasty, mean behaviour. I'm hurting everyone around me, my partner has so much anxiety and pain from all the past arguments we have had. Not even just the big arguments but the little day to day things where I behave like an asshole because I can't deal with the stress or the overwhelm. I feel like there are two people inside of me: the logical one who wants to be good and kind and supportive and knows how to respond to things with compassion, and the other person who is full of so much hate and rage and trys to self destruct and destroy everything with the smallest recognition of tension. I feel crazy and hurt and so desperate because I can't keep being such a disappointment to myself but I don't know how to make actual change.",Emotional Distress

"So just some context I'm a 24 year old straight male, Since I was about 15 I've had a best friend who did everything with me, It felt like the only person on earth who understood me, we grew up and graduated, partied for a bit and traveled. Then he decided to join the army, realizing he would be gone mostly all year except once every 6 months for a few day visit I was pretty heartbroken. Thought I'd deal with it but it's not easy, if anything I'm resentful he left. Only recently I realized he probably is my FP and I've never had a male one. It's usually female romantic interests I've had issues with then I'd just distance myself. Now it's my guy friend so I don't know how to deal with it. I realized he was my fp when he was coming down to visit and decided to spend more time with other people than me. I lost it, I blew up and panicked. Thinking in my head I wish he was dead or I'd never talk to him. Now I'm not sure if I should be his friend if he has this much leverage on me emotionally.",Emotional Distress
"Cw: mention of suicidal ideation / self harm Last night after some minor drama with my favorite person, I went out at night with water and a pill bottle and took pills. I know I should not have logically done this. I still feel sick this morning, but I'll be okay. I have never actually acted on these thoughts until last night so that makes me think that I need to talk to someone and find help urgently. I just don't know who to turn to, because I do not have insurance currently so it's not as if I can admit myself to inpatient. At least not without getting my family info severe medical debt. I feel like my impulsivity is the primary symptom that, when combined with emotional instability, poses an actual danger to my well being. The scariest part is that I feel like doing it again tonight. I know I should not and I need to be willing to accept help. I *want* help, I just don't know where to find it.

"Hello follow BPD friends, I would like to receive some input from those of you who suffer from psychosis (diagnosed) along with BPD (diagnosed). 1. Do you conduct imaginary conversations with people from your life and/or imaginary people? 2. Are these conversations mostly bourne from anger? 3. Are these conversations the result of incessant imaginary attacks from people who have angered you in the past and/or imaginary attacks? 4. Do you consume drugs/have you noticed these symptoms improving or becoming worse over time since you started to consume drugs? Obviously, this is what's going on with me and has been going on for many years. I didn't talk to my medical professional about it before because I did not realize it was happening. I'm aware of the egodystonic nature of psychosis versus the egosyntonic nature of BPD traits. I'm generally well-read on the topic, so **what I'm specifically asking is if any of you have received a diagnosis of psychosis for symptoms comparable to the above, or if you have received medical feedback that this is simply a BPD traits manifestation (particularly, anger)**. I'm currently not on medication for BPD traits and have never been on antipsychotics. Thank you in advance.",Emotional Distress
"I thought I was doing good, maybe I was. It seemed like the professional help I needed was finally starting to get here.

I feel like I can't handle life. The smallest fucking things just break me apart. I constantly think things over. When I'm suicidal (almost always) people tell me just to reach out to family or friends..but I do, and then they get tired of hearing me talk about the same things again. I don't know what they expect; it would be better if they were at least honest with the fact they're tires of me. I'm a bad person. I do bad things. I can't enjoy life. What's the point of sticking around? People suffer because of my dramatic and emotional life and because I'm weak. And the help isn't there.

":::Again, I think we see different problems. You see my piping the Ravi Shankar links as a burden, which I unfortunately created by having Ravi Shankar (musician). I do not, because I believe there will always be a need for someone to watch over new links to Ravi Shankar. The links that had already been created demonstrate that people will link to Ravi Shankar, even when the person meant is not the musician. This will continue to happen, and it will continue to need correcting. The question is are we going to make it easier on those who do the correcting, or are we going to make it harder. I can appreciate the argument that the needs of the end users and the needs of the editors outweigh the needs of link-fixers. But I have yet to hear exactly how an editor or an end user is inconvenienced.

It's just so frustrating to finally know what's going on, ans to have a doctor that cared more then to just call me depressed, and then have someone discredit me. I'm already in a vulnerable spot with this new information and I just wanted her to comfort me but that will never happen. I can't even think straight it feels like now im so overwhelmed.

"My boyfriend, or ex... He left me. I don't know if I should even try anymore. I honestly don't want a future if it's not with him. We were talking about having kids, grandkids, getting married. I have never experienced this much pain before, I have never loved anyone this much before. I feel like I'm dying, and I kind of hope I am. I gave it my all these past weeks, because he said things were getting hard. We agreed to try more (or so I thought), and he apparently gave up 2 seconds later and kept it from me even though I asked. I want to die. I honestly do. I don't want a future. I don't want to be with anyone else. I secretly hope he will want me back, but I know that will never happen, and I would never ask him to take me back. I would accept in a heartbeat, it's all I really want... And I want him to feel as much pain as I am feeling, because I'm angry. It is so unfair. I don't think I can do this anymore.

And both are so talented! love itt :) THIS SONG IS GONNA BE HUUUGEE OMG I LOVVVE!! :D amazing. I think it's more that girls don't like ,Soppy, guys rather than ,nice, Guys. Girls do break up with clingy guys because clingy is not an attractive trait. A guy can be amazing all around but just be texting you 24/7 and although they think they're being ,nice, they are being clingy/desperate. So if you confuse clingy/desperate as being ,nice, then yes.

I've been in therapy all year for PTSD/BPD. I've already been dealing with a lot of feelings that make me think I'm a phony, or a wuss. And now telling an ex-marine that I've been bad about staying in contact with makes me feel terrible. My first reaction was to text another friend about it, but I am bad about staying in contact with my other friends and only one of them knows.

"Hey everyone. I am undiagnosed but interested in finding out more about BPD and its treatment. Can anyone suggest some resources for me? Not sure how much information I should include here, but I am open to discussing anything about my situation if it can help me or others. I am a 36M (sometimes my reddit avatars are female which confuses some). I live in rural East Tx which is an underserved area for mental health, so in-person therapy may not be feasible. I would consider online therapy but would likely need to save up first since I always seem to explode and quit jobs or get fired due to another dwi or stint in treatment - so no insurance and limited cash flow. I have a history of self-harm in the form of IV drug abuse and experience hella mood swings that can spiral out of control quickly. I did experience sexual abuse as a child, although I downplayed it for many years. I have a laundry list of harms that medical doctors have committed against me, so I guess I'm looking for books that can help guide me at this point. Thank you in Advance.",Suicidal Reference

"First of all, our relationship is amazing. We started dating when I was a Junior in high school and I'm currently finishing up my freshman year of college. They're a senior in high school and our relationship has worked with very few problems over the years. However, something that has always happened in our relationship is they'll bounce back and forth between wanting to date or not wanting to date, getting upset with me randomly and so on. One month they want to run away with me and I'm the best thing ever, and the next I'm a hindrance and not worthy. It makes a lot of sense now that we finally understand what's going on. I'm bipolar myself, so I don't struggle with understanding this issue at all, but what are things that I can do to help my girlfriend and navigate the times when they feel unsure?

"I am not a professional and don't know the exacts of your situation, but I will speak as someone who, similar to your friend, pushed everyone away with the intention to die alone. He is not thinking straight while sick, and desperately needs you and needs help. Even if he is mad at you now, if he can get better he'll understand and you'll be closer for it. He is hurting you to push you away, not because he is actualy mad. Staying in his life is a start, though may not be enough. If you are able to contact his therapist or doctor please do so and let them know what is going on and ask what you can do to help more. Try and find a way to ease his isolation as best you can, try to get him to engage in activities with you. There is also a program in many areas refered to as a Baker Act, I recomend it only as a last ditch effort if he is showing signs of self harm or immediate danger.

"` : Ed, we all have our biases, you and me both. My concern about the article is that it needs to cover a lot of bases. Broadly speaking, to be fair to all parties concerned, let's acknowledge that a) damaging quotations are a part and parcel of partisan politics, b) there is debate about whether and when such quotations are legitimate, because c) some can be taken out of context, while d) different politicians exhibit different speaking styles and such styles can be the source of parody and such parodies are often based on at least some degree of truth, and e) sometimes politicians really are dumbasses. Taken in a broader context, that is how artististic political characaturists and comic impressionists make their living. Did Carter really smile broadly and instantly? Did Ronald Reagan really say ``Well`` at the beginning of sentences? Where would we be without Dana Carvey and Rich Little? Obviously, this is an issue that both you and I feel strongly about.

And when one of the other roommates sexually coerced me and then moved in his own girlfriend in they took his side and kicked me out.

So as you can guess I have BPD. I've been enrolled in a once a week DBT programme for about a year now. I feel to some extent it's helped my self harm. I only attempted suicide once in that year so I guess it was effective? But recently I feel everything has got a lot worse. I use my skills but they don't help. I constantly switch between agitated and highly depressed. I become so depressed I have no motivation to get out of bed. I sleep roughly 2-3 hours a night. I have nightmares and in the last month I've tried slit my wrist and drown myself. My reasoning for this is I feel everyone around me would be much better off without me. I still go to my job but I'm late everyday and I feel I'm close to being fired. I'm not sure what I should do. I feel one false move and I will probably kill myself. I've also been seeing flashes of white light so I feel my physical health is going. What should I do if I feel my DBT is not affective? I can't go on like this.,Suicidal Reference

"Needing help. Finding it really difficult to hold tension/pain. **Prompting Event:** There was a very painful interpersonal situation that occurred months ago that caused lots of falling out in a friend group that I distanced myself from.

"I (31F) haven't been in a long term rs for nearly 5 years. My ex has Bipolar and was untreated through the relationship.

I now have no problem meeting people, ascertaining healthy boundaries, respecting others boundaries and developing relationships however when it gets to the commitment and exclusivity phase I either get really scared, freak out and run or I have difficulty filtering my negative emotional thoughts and impulses which can lead me to acting incredibly insecure and intense - due to abandonment and self worth issues.

"Yes, I had sever post-partum depression after my second child. It was the scariest thing I ever went through. I did not have this when my daughter was born. I have always had depression. But when my son was born it was unbelievable. I had thoughts of wanting to kill my own son! I wanted him to be another girl. I knew that this was NOT ME. But I could not stop the thoughts from coming. Luckily we had a close friend that was a Neurologist that told my husband to get me to the doctor right away. It still took almost 8 months for me to recover on meds. I could not remember how to write my own name. If I showered, I could not remember if I washed my hair or put on my conditioner. Please get to a psychiatrist and begin treatment for this right away. It can get worse. It is dangerous for you and your child or children. Feel free to message me if you need to talk.

So I did what anyone would do and ask if her friends or parents said anything or didn't like me. She just told me to drop it and refused to discuss it further. I tried to press a little bit more the next day and she told me that it wasn't worth starting trouble over. I tried to ask again a few weeks after that and she just said it was over now and to forget that she even said it.

In order to interact, I just have to know who I'm supposed to be for them. I feel like a lot of times, this supplements having to have a personality. As long as people give me the appropriate box to fit into, I'm okay. I can be anything they need me to be as long as I know what it is. But fuck do I hate not knowing who I'm supposed to be for them. Especially in romantic relationships. Until I figure out what persona I'm filling, I can't ever relax or feel comfortable.

I used to self harm for many years and looked online at the time for online support groups which helped. I also got over cutting slowly through the help of a very good friend who taught me to write my pain away through journals and poetry id never written poetry until then aged 35 they were deep and dark i started posting them on various self harm forums and it really helped. Im now 46 and last time i cut i was 40 and had been doing it since i was 14. Apart from seeking medical help please keep what i called a self care box at hand. New fresh clean razor antiseptic wipes butterfly stiches ect. It keeps you safe i learned that after a wound of mine got badly infected so is very important! I personally learned i used to cut to forget the pain but in a vicious circle every scar reminded me daily of all the parts of life i was desperate to forget.....

"Abilify (Aripiprazole) has shown some clinical effectiveness in treating borderline personality disorder. And let me just say, these magic little tic tacs have made a world of difference for me, when combined with therapy and my antidepressant. A year ago, my romantic relationship was particularly triggering, and I was prone to episodes of rage and self harm. I felt horribly inadequate, alien and at a constant risk of being abandoned. Nowadays, my moods are steadier, without any sense of being 'zombified.' It feels like I have a chance to practice some self-soothing exercises when I'm feeling triggered, as opposed to suddenly flying into blinding, red-hot fury or a suicidal spiral of desperate sadness. My self perception is also a lot more rational- I still see my faults, but they don't seem world-ending, anymore. The people around me seem more accepting, trustworthy and empathetic. Even if they're not prescribed Abilify, I highly recommend that anyone who is feeling 'stuck' in their current treatment speaks to their psychiatrist about treatment options. I had to specifically ask about them, months after my diagnosis, to start the conversation. It's worth it, and so are you.",Safe/Neutral
"Hello everyone, I already posted here before. I will keep it short and simple. Ever since my gf left me due to one of my episodes being too much for her, I have been feeling worse and worse and it seems that for one reason or another, my symptoms spiked like no tomorrow. As I speak I ruptured my friendship of 4 years with 2 best friends I had simply because I started to hate them for reasons beyond my understanding, I started to hate everything I had done with them and everything I did or experienced seemed fake, as if they hadn't happen, as if I wanted to put everything behind me. As I speak I just want to become an entirely new person, stop being me, restart everything. I don't know who I am or what I believe in anymore, I just feel like I have to become someone else, as if whoever I was failed miserably at existence and I just want to distance myself from it as much as possible. I think of it as existential suicide. I feel stuck in a husk that is not mine.",Suicidal Reference
"There's been several situations where I clearly remember being physically harmed by someone, being shoved into multiple items, and even given a black eye - while having my glasses broken right on my face. I know for a fact that I did, in fact, have a black eye - because I went to my therapist appointment with it and felt embarrassed. But that person swears up and down that they didn't give me the black eye, that I fell. And while they admit to some of the physical harm (we both have shoved each other, toxic I know), they tell me that I remember it wrong. From my memory, I would say something that was too far and they would come rushing at me from another room and scream in my face, then shove me. But again, they insist that I'm remembering that wrong, and that's not how things happened. I feel like I'm crazy. Because I know people with bpd misremember things, or perceive things wrong.

"For background, I am 33 and just recently received my diagnosis. I have been in therapy on and off for other assorted mental health diagnoses since 2014. Is anyone else married or in a long term relationship with their FP? My husband has been my FP probably since year one or two of our marriage, and that has come with all the things it implies. Everything for him is magnified, he gets my worst and my best, and I have thrown a lot at him over the years. Everything I'm reading seems to imply that FP relationships are inherently toxic or at a minimum difficult to manage, and I find it kind of confusing because my marriage is extremely compatible and happy. To be transparent, my husband likely has a personality disorder as well and thrives off of care-giving and being needed and adored. My therapists have always sort of implied that we are healthy for each other, though perhaps we wouldn't be the healthiest for others and that we are just very compatible.

Simultaneously, the very debate makes me even more suicidal because it's so exhausting to have two subunits of my mind fight.

On top of that, my partner has expressed some openness to an open relationship, but is simultaneously a very jealous person.

They used to be a cheerful sight flying over our school in hemel hempstead when I was a kid - always turned my head to watch whenever they went over, though the 1-11s in particular were hard to avoid as they were so noisy!

This is the whole reason I thought I had bipolar first before I knew what BPD was. I get so happy, chatty, and even confident when I'm in a scenario where I flourish. But come a time where I am alone and can think, I start hyperanalyzing every move I did when I was in that state. I've been able to control those thoughts better with a few lifestyle changes.

So diagnosed BPD here and I know over the years I've fluctuates between an absolute mess to you can't even tell. However currently I'm sort of noticing my symptoms getting a lot more severe.

Honestly it doesn't sound like a bad idea since this family has been very violent the cost of living in the other state would be much cheaper.

I mean it's like I do sort of have to move but how will I manage my symptoms which are getting more pronounced while also juggling a whole new environment and all that. Is there a chance that a fresh start and move will help in the short term with some of my fears of abandonment or will it only make me more hostile and angry. Idk.

So glad that I'm not the only one in the world who enjoys an immature weird sense of humor. Go Furious Pete! Seriously thank you Misha and everyone from periphery. I've never loved a band that gave back to the fans more than you guys do. You guys truly do reach out to your fanbase. Brilliant. Love it. Print it. what. When he goes to his laptop he's actually just tweeting and updated his facebook status... Not playing music. And also notice how the music continues playing when he's stage diving and NO ONE is standing behind the gear. Like. Uh. hahha Hahha yeaa it was.. The medical field will do that to you. It just really bugs me when people actually really think they can feel better about drinking a diet version of something. Please shut up. If it were the same Periphery would have a fanbase full of obsessed 12 year old girls. My god people I like the instrumental version too but give spenc a break.

"Hello. I'm new here, and recently diagnosed with BPD. I've always had a lot of difficulty with interpersonal relationships and being acutely sensitive to people's moods, but I never thought I had a problem until this past year. I started dating my boyfriend, and about a month into the relationship I started going absolutely crazy with wondering when he was going to leave me or get tired of me. I've had this problem before (resulting in two divorces), but this was the first time I was forced to confront the fact that I may not be mentally well. I started working on getting help, and that's how I got my diagnosis. I wouldn't say I'm relieved to be diagnosed, but in a way I am. I can't tell you how many times people have asked me what is wrong with me, only to have me answer 'I don't know.' Now I at least have an answer. Suddenly I'm starting to make sense to myself. I have a really long way to go, but I am trying to be better. I'm really grateful that spaces like this exist.",Safe/Neutral

They make you do stupid exercises or just sit there staring at you in creepy silence waiting for you to keep talking Plus, not to sound arrogant, but I find it hard to believe that another person has answers to my problems that I havent thought of already and either tried, or found a reason why it wouldnt work. Im also afraid that the psychiatrist will force me to be hospitalized if I tell them about how I want to kill myself on a weekly basis, or that they will refuse to treat me if I get diagnosed with BPD.

"I need some perspective hence why I'm writing this post. About a year ago my boyfriend of 6 years has asked me to help him understand his emotions so I did. He didn't understand the emotions he had for my younger sister, he was basically emotionally attracted to her. Hearig that has completely destroyed me. I stayed with him since I thought to myself that he will never ever in a million years pursue or act on those emotions. I hoped that whatever emotional attraction he felt will disappear since he is not indulging or pursuing it. For the past year I had suspicion that his emotional attraction towards my sister has not actually disappeared and I was right. Today he told me that on some level he is still emotionally attracted to her but he says it is meaningless as what he has with me its what he values. I can understand what he says but I cannot live and be with him knowing what I know. I feel so betrayed and heartbroken. I know people can't help feelings but I'm too hurt.

I've done a fair bit of research on BPD making sure I'm aware of what she struggles with and can react in positive ways to her feelings. I'm wondering how I can best help her during/after her 'episodes of emotional inconsistency' (what she calls it), usually lasts 2-3 days and she doesn't want to talk to me much but she usually apologizes afterwards for her distance. I tell her she doesn't need to apologize and I don't blame her. She communicates very well when these moods come up. I often message her and send memes during this time with no expectation of responses. How can I make her feel supported during and after these times?

"`=Short response=== I have to say I haven't read all the discussions here, but I can tell you're talking about race. No one is talking about race here. Read the article. Where's race being discussed? We're not talking about a Jewish race. We're talking about an ethnic group. Hopefully you know the difference between a race and an ethnic group? An ethnic group is a group of people who closely identify with one-another (sometimes through having common ancestors, but not necessarily so) and share a unique culture and language. Persian Jews definitely fall in this category. They identify closely with one another (for most of their history Persian Jews have been living in secluded ``Jewish ghettos``) and they most certainly share a unique culture and language. Questioning the ethnicity of Persian Jews is simply absurd. Let me also re-quote this sentence from Britannica Encyclopedia: ``The Jews trace their heritage in Iran to the Babylonian Exile of the 6th century BC and, like the Armenians, have retained their ethnic, linguistic, and religious identity.`` Discussing ``race`` might not be appropriate here, but discussing ethnicity definitely is. ==`",Safe/Neutral

"Ed, I am tired! Anyway, I certainly did not mean to trivialize the suffering of vicitms of racism, only to say that most scientists racist and anti-racist have not been persecuted the way Galileo was. Perhaps racist scientists should be. But even here I would qualify it not only do I not want to put some racist scientists in the US or Canada in the same category of Joseph Mengele, I think the crucial difference is precisely the social context we live in a society based on free debate where a few scientists can be racist and they will be challenged publically and a well-informed public can make up its mind. In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies, both here and in Germany, and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things. But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

"I would also try to reach out to the neighbor and gain their sympathy. Or , ask the landlord /manager if the door can be muffled or put on one of those hinges that control how fast or slow the door closes so that it closes slower. However, I have been in similar situations and have seen the supposedly gained sympathy and understanding bear little other fruit. It's harder, but much more effective to reduce your hope of changing other people's actions and try to decondition yourself as much as you can, even if it's just a little. Increasing your tolerance and flexibility will serve you and others the most in the long run. I also have a lot of anxiety and have been troubled by loud sudden noises. Ironically, I have an emotional support dog who also hates sudden loud noise, especially of the bang variety. His barking and my needing to comfort /quiet him have actually helped increase my tolerance of such sounds. Whatever happens, I have faith in your ability to find resolution! The situation can't go on forever. Best luck.",Safe/Neutral
"I'm usually a fairly happy go lucky person, but I have to be honest. Seeing a lot of responses directed at people discussing BPD in relationships has me super down. Telling people to run? Seriously? I mean, I get that some people have bad experiences, but not all of us are terrible people. We all deserve a chance. I'm not exaggerating when I say some of the shit I've read in the past two days has made me seriously consider suicide. If society sees me as a monster akin to a pedophile or rapist (this analogy was used multiple times by a certain user), is it worth it? Yes. It is. But it's hard. Reading articles like the one mentioned in a post the other day (how to train your borderline) make me physically ill. I know you can't reason with the kind of people who write that trash, but I still try. I'm a glutton for punishment that way. As long as there's a chance I might make them understand how wrong they are, I'll try. It gets better, or so they say.",Suicidal Reference

There are times when Im very happy with them, but recently one of the girls I was feeling close to got a girlfriend, and Im happy for her, but she barely wants to spend any time with me anymore even though she does with the others. The other girl I was also faily close to started talking ti me less and less and lowkey kind of indirectly insilts me for being socially awkward.

"I don't know what's wrong and I'm not sure where else to post this. Maybe this is a narcissistic thing?

Like it's easy for me to say that I don't want that because that's not right for me to want, but does my mind agree with that? Because clearly if I feel like I'm uglier because women I like aren't flocking to me to tell me how much they want me as soon as I put out a selfie, then that's not a healthy way to think? It's weird because I know for myself even and a lot of people, I need some sort of emotional attachment to whoever I like in order to be sexually attracted to them. I just feel like I'm in some sort of mental and moral conflict and I'm not sure what to do about it. I Just want to feel hot and desirable again.",Emotional Distress
"Finally, after almost three months of a mental break and an inpatient stay, I'm back at work in person. It's been hard as work was an enormous trigger and added to an absolute breakdown (on top of breaking up with my FP/SO, the pain from a unmanaged disability, no support system or friends in my new town). Prior to the hospital, I would be crying in my car every lunch break. Things have been tense with my boss they continued to be bad when I worked remotely upon my return. Luckily, I'm back in person full-time. My coworkers have been so nice and even tried to take care of my desk plant while I was gone. I'm nervous how I'll hold up at home tonight, but for the meantime I'm okay and I'm grateful for today. My meds and my therapy has me more stable than right before the incident and after months of non-stop crying and anxiety, that is huge for me.

"A few times I remember something like this. Being in the emergency room because family wanted me hospitalized, telling them 'No, I do not want to harm myself. I don't want to kill myself.' And them writing down the opposite. Another time IN the psychiatric hospital. I always said normal/healthy things because I wanted to get out. Frankly, the doctor rarely asked questions. Or gave a shit. But APPARENTLY he wrote down that I was still very suicidal and often expressed desire to hurt myself. I never said anything like that. So I had to stay longer, because he wrote down things I never said... Sure, in other situations, I definitely DID show lots of signs of wanting to hurt myself and actually doing it. But those times, it feels like they just lied. Anyone else ever have moments like that? Where no one believes you because a 'doctor' wrote down otherwise? You question whether or not you simply don't remember properly? It's scary... Everyone thinks you're 100% insane and talks to you as if you're an idiot and completely out of it.",Suicidal Reference
"Without going into a huge backstory, for brevity's sake, I've been having a really difficult time the last few days, stemming from the end of a very important relationship/friendship. I have an abnormally good memory (it can be argued that I have hyperthymesia, though I realistically probably just have an exceptionally good, precise memory), and therefore my brain constantly attacks me with memories...sometimes to the point where I have to physically shake my head and exclaim 'Stop!' This has been happening a lot the last few days, and as a result, I feel like hiding and completely disappearing from everyone. I feel that way quite often, actually, which I find odd given my BPD diagnosis (which I only received recently, mind you). I can't even really explain a reason why I want to disappear. I never have a real reason for feeling this way. It just always feels like a good idea to hide in my house, never go outside, and essentially become Boo Radley.

And outside of the death of my maternal grandpa when I was 8 as well as a close friend last year (I attempted suicide a few days after that one), I haven't been able to feel anything. It really bugs me, because my mom mentioned that she had thought of swallowing her whole bottle of anti-anxiety pills and was crying all night, while I feel fucking empty. Maybe it's just apparent competence making it look like I am being strong right now.

"I (31F) haven't been in a long term rs for nearly 5 years. I developed BPD nearing the end of that rs and through our break up (in conjunction with family trauma).

I am seeking advice because I find myself still self sabotaging potential relationships. I have developed an intense fear of commitment fueled by my lingering abandonment and self worth issues. I now have no problem meeting people, ascertaining healthy boundaries, respecting others boundaries and developing relationships however when it gets to the commitment and exclusivity phase I either get really scared, freak out and run or I have difficulty filtering my negative emotional thoughts and impulses which can lead me to acting incredibly insecure and intense - due to abandonment and self worth issues.

"I totally relate to this.. Sounds like youre talking right out of my head!!! I cant shake this horrible tired.. I was tired constantly before i started the meds n they started me at 25 mg of limictal, after the first 11 days on that dose i was gtg.. Then they doubled that n i am on now 50 mgs and i HATE this feeling!!! I have had a headache seriously since i started the medication. I feel more anxious and far more down than before i was medicated. From what i can tell from other people, this is part of your body adjusting to it. I am told to keep trying it but the goal is to get me up to 200mgs and i already want to die at just 50mgs. Ugh..

I admit that I was ignorant about BPD and after the argument I read up on it. I realize where his jealousy and paranoia come from now. I apologized to him for not knowing much about it and not looking into it until far too late. I really want to give this another try as I really am deeply in love with him. However he has no interest in me anymore. I'm looking for advice from other people with BPD. Should I just give him time? Just try to get over him? Get mad at him? Keep texting him that I miss him?

"I've struggled with MDD since I was a young teen. I've received the diagnosis of BPD though I really don't agree with it. I feel like the aspects of BPD that apply to me are a result of depression. Things like self-harm, talk of suicide, past attempts, low self-esteem, feeling hopeless. I'm rarely in any kind of relationship to have it be unstable and my relationships with others are pretty much all superficial anyway. I don't have huge emotional ups and downs; downs and further downs maybe but not ups. Anyway, I'm just wondering if others who have been diagnosed with BPD feel that it can be a result of other mental illness, not necessarily a separate disorder. Like I have low self-esteem because I have depression and I self-harm because I have low self-esteem, and I think of suicide because of the depression, etc. I feel like my doctor who has worked with me for 5 years is giving up on me because of the diagnosis and it makes me feel even worse than the depression already had!",Suicidal Reference
"Hello! I am not looking for a diagnosis online, neither am I trying to self diagnose, I am asking for insight.

I don't want this to happen for several reasons, but I won't get into that right now. My questions are (that are hopefully not offensive): - Can you have BPD if you have relatively stable relationship without being in therapy? - Is it possible to have BPD and not have frequent breakdowns? - Is it possible to have BPD and never 'splitting', aka having a stable opinion about people that usually aren't changing unless something happens? I don't think there's anything wrong with the above things or BPD, I have loved ones with BPD, I am just wondering if I am on my way to get misdiagnosed (again).",Safe/Neutral

"TW: abuse, self harm mentioned, and doubting my diagnosis I was in a relationship with someone who was emotionally and verbally abusive for 9 years. He would threaten to leave me, to kick me out, or to hurt me/himself to get his way, amongst other awful things. I only bring this up because I got diagnosed with BPD (not Quiet BPD) while I was with him and now that I've left him some of my symptoms are significantly less intense. I'm not terrified that I'm going to be abandoned, I don't feel empty anymore, my self confidence has skyrocketed, I'm pretty sure I haven't split since I left him, and I'm no longer self harming. Also when I was splitting, it was always directed at myself and mostly while he was screaming at me or directly after. I guess what I'm trying to say is, what if I don't actually have BPD? What if I was just being abused and my reactions to said abuse mimicked BPD symptoms? Is that even possible? Or am I just in denial?",Suicidal Reference

It's horrifying to think of being hated for being self-absorbed when you hate yourself. I can't even reply to stuff they've said about themselves without somehow relating it to myself, even if it's a lie or quoting someone else to fill the air. Even if I care about what they've shared with me, nothing really comes to mind to add to the conversation; I just don't have a personality and no real original thought.

She left me because she saw that I was becoming too emotionally dependent on her and my behavior scared her. It made her feel unsafe. So she left. After she asked for my trust. After she lead me to think she cared about me. After I fell in love with her. This is the worst level of judgment I've ever faced. I'm sorry I have overwhelming emotions and I'm sorry that human closeness is something I've felt so rarely that it makes me very happy when I have it from someone I adore. This is the most painful thing I've ever experienced. The fact that I know she gave herself and her body to people in the past who physically and emotionally hurt her... however my emotional instability was enough to push her away before I was even given a chance...

"This is just an epiphany I had today, I don't know if anyone will be able to relate to it but I just thought I'd share! I think one of the reasons I struggle so much with relationships is because I am capable of so so so much love. I think I have a higher capacity of love than almost anyone else I know. So when I meet someone and we start dating I fall for them at a much faster pace. I want to love love love them with all I have. And after so much experience with dating, I realize that I can't love them with all they have because they get scared away.

"The thing is, I have a major foot fetish. I've always had one, it's one of the cores of my personality. And the sexual frustration I have, there are no words to express it. I love this group, but it's packed with pretty girls with pretty feet and they are barefoot all the time, because it's summer and it's hot and we take off our shoes in the group. I know this sounds like a marginal issue but their bare feet have the same effect on me as boobs without bras would on any other guy. In a group where we are supposed to talk about our feelings I feel this constant frustration and anger over the effect they unknowingly have over me. People have no idea how hard it is for foot fetishists, girls cover their breast but nobody considers us. It affects my emotions during sessions, but 'm not sure if this is something I am entitled to come up with though. Should I say this out loud or should I keep this to myself?",Emotional Distress

"Yesterday I left my undiagnosed BPD husband of 3 years who's had lifelong addiction issues. He has since cleaned out our joint bank account and blocked me from contact. This stemmed from months of lying and stealing money and resulted in my no longer trusting him. He had been lashing out at me for not being affectionate to him - obviously as a result of my distrust. But he pushed me too far so I took some responsible distance and a mental health break from the chaos. I fully expected to continue to run the household finances as I always do but his stealing the money has prevented that. Thankfully i have my own separate account but I pay other bills from that. So with money missing and no communication, what are my resources to protect us financially? I'm still imploring him to get help but since I'm blocked I doubt it's getting through. Please no hate - I've gotten more than enough from him. I'm trying to do the right thing and also self-protect. Thank you.",Attacking Behavior

"you have consistantly provoked the other side with your endless efforts in censorship of anything that even remotely disagrees with your view of events that occured during this tragic part of history. By not accepting the immense suffering of Turks under the hand of the Armenians and the foreign occupiers, you are in fact insluting the memory of these people. This, unfortunately has very much been the position of Armenians and their western supporters, the fact that the value attached to the lives of non christians is far less important.

"I used to be a very bright person, I finished High School with disctinction. However, after turning 20 I grew more and more anxious and self-conscious and depressed. I earned a diploma but I didn't put much effort into it and I wasn't interested in my major either, so I barely remember anything from it now. It feels like I haven't really acquired any new knowledge in these past years. Most I have I picked up in my teens or earlier (I started to read very early, I was an exceptional child). I'm 29 now. I always dreamt about going into academia and honestly I did have the chance. I still might have it or at least I prefer to think that way. However, I'm still very unstable in my core personality and values and I don't know where to head. Anyway, the point of my question is: does BPD and anxiety destroy your brightness?

"Hey guys, I love this place. I love the support I've received here. However, a couple recent posts were the last straw for me in a string of frankly-disgusting posts. One was by a red-pill guy wondering how to best maniupulate a girl with BPD, which was later removed, but was still unbelievable to me. And, on another of them, about someone's ex-wife, I saw a lot of you say that this wasn't the place for him to post, and the moderator (Rain) disagreed and encouraged him seeking support. That's fine if that's how she wants to run this sub, and I have no anger towards her. But I'd like a support group that feels safe, a support group where I don't feel like I'm just as likely to discover someone attacking me/my disorder as I am to find help.

"Hey guys, I've been recently diagnosed with BPD and my therapist said that one of the diagnostic criteria is distorted thinking. Not long ago I was paranoid that my mom would find out that I sleep with my bf (I was 20 lol) or send him nudes. Like if they would take my phone and see the evidence. I knew that there wouldn't be anything bad but for whatever reason I was afraid Or that I was pregnant. I was so stressed. There was little evidence supporting that fact but I was so stressed. I was almost convinced that it was true, though at some level understood that the chances are low Also right now I kinda get brief thoughts when I am stressed that it would have been nice if my boss would kiss me or that everybody hates me.

No this is not right. And the entry must be changed back. I never implied that most of the warming wasn't human induced or that most of the warming was human-induced. This is not what the argument was about. You see if it WAS....... that would have been a reasonable argument. That's probably why you have tried to characterise it in this way. Many arguments have a little bit of promise on either side. This is not one of these arguments. My opposition knows full well that they are lying. That is why they don't debate me directly. The wording should be that it is not all human-induced and not all non-human induced. I didn't have a problem with that. It is the liars who had a problem with that.

"Greetings, I have been interested in BPD for some time, which I myself suffer from. Have you ever wondered that the 'assumptions' that arise in our brains in certain situations can be really real? I will give an example. You feel from the other person that he wants to deceive you or hurt you. Because you have experienced these similar situations several times in your life, you will feel her bad intentions. You will feel the pattern that people who have hurt you in the past have shown. Based on that, you will then behave the way you will. Impulsive rage because you feel right. You use it before her bad intentions come true because you know it can really happen. So isn't this more of a talent? The ability we have developed over the course of our lives? So isn't it more important to deal with impulse and anger than to focus on ignoring your assumptions?

"Does anyone else feel completely dissociated with their selves? Like I don't know. I feel like there is a real me with real feelings and thoughts and ideas somewhere inside of me. But the way I feel and act and think as that person doesn't match up to what I'm doing. For example, I'm an alcoholic to cope with my problems. So real me knows it's awful. I know I'm slowly killing myself. I know I have a problem and an addiction. That I could accomplish so much more if I wasn't always drunk or hungover. But it's so easy for me to dissociate myself from those thoughts and not feel bad for drinking again. I don't know. This is the latest new feeling I've discovered. I've basically been a zombie for the past few weeks because I've just ignored myself I feel like and allow almost a parasite to use my body as a host. I feel I've worded the feeling poorly but I hope someone can relate. It's a really weird feeling.",Suicidal Reference

I sometimes wish really bad things on people, even the ones that I love the most. Sometimes I find myself wishing my best friend (who is often suicidal) would actually kill herself so that I had a reason to do it myself and not feel like I am failing her. When she tells me she feels like she wants to kill herself and I'm trying to talk her out of it, sometimes I'm really thinking, 'Well, let's just do it so we can both finally end the suffering.'

I've been watching myself to see when I get flashes of anger. I don't take my anger out on others it's very self directed. I will engage in self harm and other destructive behaviours. Like drinking too much, staying awake until early morning, impulse buying, gambling etc. But as I said I've been trying to keep an eye out for when I get angry. Prior to doing this I would have said that I never get angry. But looking for it I have seen or more correctly identified anger when it happens. I have also noticed that when I get in an argument my vision seems to gray out like a mist or a fog has rolled in. My self harming seems to dropping away.

I've been telling my boyfriend and friends that I haven't had the guts to call a therapist yet. That's a lie. I did it in case I didn't get better, so they wouldn't think I was a failure.

"Try to eliminate some of the meds that are not doing anything for you and keep taking the meds that do. It can take quite a while to find which ones are right for you and what the minimum dose is that is effective. Being pressured will not leave you in a position to reduce any of your meds. Being misunderstood will make you feel worse. I have had to accept that I have to take my tablets. I have tried to stop taking them before and landed up being much worse than what I began. Work with your doctor or mental health clinic to establish which one or two tablets may be balancing the chemicals in your brain. Sometimes the onset is triggered by certain persons in your life but even if you stay away from them, you may need less meds but the imbalance will still be there albeit to a lesser degree.

The best advice I can give is to talk to someone you trust who won't be all judgemental on you. Someone who will let you het your emotions out so you don't feel the need to take it out on yourself. Therapy really helps too but it seems that may be an issue for you financially. Maybe look up a support group for help then. Also in therapy they teach you coping methods of things to help you keep from harming yourself. Exp: journaling, listen to music, go for a walk, do some art work or call a friend. Whatever helps you personally. Every one is different. Good luck to you ❤",Suicidal Reference

Kind of figured that it was bringing anxiety that I had washed over my whole life, which I think is partially true I think. I also was having goosebumps more frequently, which is from the norepinephrine spike I learned. Still was having problems with concentration, and everything said to try a stronger does. Went to a higher dose on an extended release. This was all before my BPD diagnosis came through.

That's how the upvote system works. It's not based on fact or logic; it's based on human response, which is usually emotional. If human response were logical, we would not have so many factually wrong posts hitting the front page with their top comments being corrections that debunk the post in question. Reddit is like other social media in that it triggers a kind of immune response. A 'threat' is *all-bad*. Any time a post is made about a celebrity doing a bad thing, the comments will be *riddled* with the phrase 'piece of shit'. A person is either all-good or all-bad, according to Reddit's hivemind. The upvoted comments will reinforce this, and the downvoted comments are the ones questioning it. The voice of reason is shut down entirely by clicks.",Safe/Neutral

"Sue, I could have written your post. My mother suffered from severe manic depression. She was delusional. She thought people on the radio were listening to her and people on TV were watching her. She endured many ECTS and hospital stays. She would walk around barefoot during the winter wearing only a thin spring coat while looking for cigarette butts left on the sidewalk. It was awful. I never had any friends over because I didn't want to have to explain to them why my mother was different than theirs. She died at age 54 from cancer. My brother was Bipolar too. He committed suicide in Feb. 2010 because he couldn't stand being in pain all the time from depression. I am Bipolar too, but fortunately I am not suicidal.

I've recently started thinking that I may have Avoidant in addition to BPD. But I also know that people with BPD tend to self-victimize and convince ourselves that we are worse off than we really are. But I think I could fit the description, and I'd like my psychiatrist to evaluate me for it. Getting my BPD diagnosis was huge for me, allowing me to make tremendous progress, so if this (AvPD) were a correct diagnosis, I'm thinking it'd be very helpful. Problem is, I am afraid to do that because I don't want to be wrong. I feel like if I am wrong, I will come off as just whiny.

"Hello first time posting. 3 years ago I was diagnosed with BPD. It was a shock, but explained so much. I was a bomb disposal operator in the British army and reached the rank of sergeant at 25 years old. Unfortunately I had go medically discharged, bpd is not compatible with military life. Having suffered all the main symptoms of bpd of my life, I had two choices, be sad and angry and let BPD control me. Or use the qualities from my personality disorder to good use. Safe to say, I'm not perfect. Fucked up a few times, but success is achievable. After leaving the army I had nothing, now I have 3 houses ( I rent out 2) a decent job and a beautiful wife.

"I haven't officially been diagnosed (it's a long story), but I have a very good feeling that I do have BPD since I fit most of the criteria listed in the DSM - V (I study mental health and counselling and have access to the text). I have, however, been diagnosed with ADHD because of the mood swings, irritability, impulsive behaviour, etc, (on top of the attention deficits) so I'm prescribed stimulants to get my school work done. They're helpful...until they wear off. Some of the all day medication I've taken in the past has actually managed to make me feel suicidal out of seemingly nowhere, or has otherwise given me a full on nervous breakdown. I'm wondering if anyone else has experience with BPD and ADHD and taking stimulants? They literally make all of my *suspected* BPD symptoms so much worse but going without means I have the added stress of not doing well in school... its a bit of a catch 22.",Suicidal Reference

I think I've been splitting on him for ages, on and off. I find being in a relationship at all to be so frustrating. I don't want to have to deal with it any more. But I can't say anything because I just can't communicate and I can't face the idea of ending the relationship. Before I started medication I just wanted to die all the time but at least now I don't feel like that. But I feel like I'll still be stuck here in another 16 years because I can't actually do anything. It's like I'm frozen.",Emotional Distress
"Hello guys/gals, First off, I hope you're having a semi decent day, and if you're not, I hope it gets better. Trying to think positive over here. I've noticed that for the past few years I have a hard time keeping a job. I'll find a post for a job, go to the interview (nervous as fuck until it's over), get the job and get let go after the three month probation. When someone critiques me I usually take it personally which fucks up my performance which spirals into me being even more nervous at work. Which morphs into me hating the job because I carry my wrecked nerves home with me. For my last 'adult' job I had to get a mouth guard because I was grinding my teeth in my sleep because of my anxiety. (Can't wear the thing. It's too bulky for me to sleep properly). Does anyone have any similar experiences/a way to cope with this?",Emotional Distress
"I blame everyone else for anything thats wrong but I also hate myself for not being someone else. I'm fat, I'm annoying, I deserve to die. Those are things I think everyday at least. And I honestly believe I am. Other people are too, why don't they hate themselves? I just want to die to get away from myself. I want to be desired, and I always feel rejected. I never leave my house unless I have to. I have no friends and I'm always so awkward, too pushy. I just want to be accepted. Whenever someone I opened up to or trusted rejects me or betrays me I always blame myself. Maybe if I was skinnier, or more successful, or maybe if I had more beautiful hair. Then I know they'd like me. If I just wasn't me. Does anyone know what's going on with me? Have you ever dealt with these feelings? I'm so tired of hating myself.",Suicidal Reference

"I went to my psychiatrist yesterday and she said that I was doing so well, and that if I wanted to I didn't have to come back and see her. I suppose a normal reaction would be to feel super happy / accomplished but I just feel weird. She said I could see a gp if I felt the need (I've never been to a gp without wanting to cry afterwards lol) What if I get sick again? What if I'm not creative anymore? Did I just make the whole thing up? Was I fine this whole time? I said I would come back for one last session (I'm such a cling on omg) why. Any advice?

"I have always taken my Lamictal in one dose. Asked my dr if I could. She looked up the half life & told me I could. Its more convenient & I don't miss doses. Some drs tell me it needs to be in 2 doses. Yet I've never had any of them look up the half life. I continued to take it in one dose, but I tell the dr whatever they want to hear. Lamictal is a mood stabilizer. Abilify is an anti-psychotic medication. Lexapro, zoloft, etc are anti-depressant drugs. Be careful not to compare these drugs to one another. It would be like comparing apples to oranges. Lastly......Cheryl Berndt. You are confused. Genetic disorders like bipolar, depression, GAD, ADHD, ARE treatable with medications. Things like PTSD, narcissistic personality disorder, Stockholm syndrome, etc are also mental illnesses. Yet these are some types of mental illnesses that medication does little for.

You'd think the guy could take a better picture or scan, especially since the whole goal of posting it appears to be proving his name to people critical of his pseudonymity without any further doubt. Regardless, and to fit with conventions, it may still be appropriate to add a (born Philip John Eide) to this entry or a future entry for Xavier Von Erck.

"David, I have a couple of questions regarding your last edit to Skene's glands. Basically, the article matched the given references better before your edit. Did you work off of some other reference? 03:35 Jan 11, 2003 (UTC) Feel free to discuss your questions directly with me by email if you like (wiki lets you do this by clicking a link). I used a variety of references obtained via Google, which I did not list in the article (I probably should have). I have doubts about some of the information that was there before my changes and that you have restored. In particular, I believe that Skene's glands are not the same as the G-spot, and are not located there. However, stimulation of the G-spot can cause female ejaculation, which generates fluid from the Skene's glands (among other tissues). By the way, your contributions to Wikipedia are impressive. 23:32 Jan 14, 2003 (UTC)",Safe/Neutral

Ill keep it short. My boyfriend just broke up with me several days ago. It was emotionally abusive and he would often punish me for being borderline and accuse me of cheating everytime we weren't together. He has a drug problem with pills and weed. I just- I tried saving him for so long and took everything he threw at me just to help him. He said terrible things to me the day after we broke up. I blocked him and had my best friend tell him to never contact me again. That took a lot after being together for nearly 2 two years. My question is -surprisingly- I have a hard time seeing my therapist and psychiatrist regularly. I wanna speak to my psychiatrist today just to let him know what's going on.

Upon reading about it and such - I'm really wondering whether or not my emotional distress over the years has been bpd masked under depression and anxiety. Not looking for a diagnosis here, but I have a question about splitting. Is it demonizing another person simply because they don't react the way you expect? I.e. no validation in extreme emotions, reacting angrily, ignoring, or anything other than validation and patience? Could demonizing be coming up with mental illnesses for the other person's lack of validation to bpd person's emotions? Or creating dramatic scenarios for that person to basically fall in to like a trap so bpd person can point the finger and say they're the bad guy? Are triggers usually someone's tone or lack of validation in crazy making behavior from bpd person? Any insight helps. Thank you!",Emotional Distress

"The silent treatment/going ghost/ignoring my messages is the most infuriating thing for me to endure. I know it's probably part of my need for control. I just think it's so cruel because you have no idea what happened. If you go on a date with me and you don't like me at least have the courtesy to say hey I don't think we're a good match and you'll never hear from me again. When I get no response I'm left wondering what I did wrong or if you thought I was ugly or fat or anything else I can think of and what you're telling other people about me! I know most just find it easier to ignore than saying something that might hurt someone's feelings, but the wondering is far worse than anything they could say to me. Just had to rant and get that off my chest!",Emotional Distress
"So I have this issue where if something is really upsetting me, I get really loud because I get frustrated. And whoever I am upset with I won't let them exit the conversation because of my intense emotion and the inability for it to be resolved inside myself or for me to let it go. I tend to physically block the person where they have to listen to what I'm saying and when I get really disregulated I find this really hard to control. Sometimes I end up even pushing the person backwards. Please help, I've been told and have come to realise this is abusive behaviour. I can't take it back, and I feel like a defect of a human who can't help myself and continues to hurt others. I really don't want to be this. But does anyone relate?

To break that consensus for any sect is POV if it is not done for any other sect of similar prominence. I lost out on that consensus, but let us follow through then. Personally, I think the two beliefs sections should be one and all of this information should be in, but the consensus is otherwise.

"When you're suicidal you're in the tunnel and it's black. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. And it hurts and it's disorienting and scary and you can even hyperventilate to the point at which you become calm because you begin to think you'll kill yourself and start developing a plan. I think the key is faith, and not necessarily in god, just faith that just as there's darkness, naturally there WILL be lightness very soon, and you can withstand this pain that will definitely release you when the light in the tunnel enters, and it will. At this point you will breathe better, think more clearly and positively, and walk away from the black spell. You will have missed a bullet and get on with the rest of your day.

"I struggle a lot with idealization and devaluation specifically with this one friend of mine. I dont know why my brain is especially hard on them and whenever they dont like up to my frankly impossible expectations I hate them. Like just last week I wanted to tell them to fuck off and never talk to me again and today I feel blessed to be their friend because they did something nice for me. Thankfully I never act my feelings out because I'm honestly just too cowardly to do so. But anyway, I was just thinking that even if I never let my frustrations out on them its very unfair for me to do that. I've never really discussed this with my therapist but I want to know if it would be even worth doing. Has therapy helped you with idealizing/devaluating people?",Emotional Distress
"` I think there's a difference between ``product placement`` (which is taking money from sponsors to feature their products in a show, often with cross-promotion - ie. James Bond and BMW) and using name-brand products in a show to give it authenticity. It's jarring when a couple of wealthy guys are sitting around drinking no-name beer, as we've seen in the past. While some may doubt whether the spokespeople are telling the truth, the article should only feature sourced information. If it deserves mention in the article at all (which I'm dubious about) it should be something like ``Sopranos is known for featuring name-brand products such as cars and clothing labels prominently.

My wife has been diagnosed with BPD recently but has been suffering for 10 years. She is currently in a 'High Care' area of an inpatient Mental Health Facility. For the past 48 hours she has been in a cycle of: - Trying to commit suicide - Being Restrained - Being doped up - Locked in padded room until she calms down enough that they release her - Back to trying to kill herself within an hour. The doctors continue to do the same thing and I am wondering what can be done whilst she is in this cycle to try and stop it? Is there anything I can do? Is there anything the doctor should be doing that I can check on? Asking here because some people here may have been in the same situation and would know what to do/ask.,Suicidal Reference

"` Another thought - is describing the word as a ``neologism`` superfluous, perhaps? I've always been an advocate of approaching writing a Wikipedia article as if everything you're writing about happened a thousand years ago and is ancient history, because it seems to me that's the proper style for an encyclopaedia, which is intended to be timeless and authoritative. ``Neologism`` is an inescapably relative word - *all* words are neologisms looked at from one perspective in time, soon after they are invented. (All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance).

'Joe Paterno let an accused Pedophile roam the campuses free....when Sandusky was charged in 1998....Paterno simply let him 'retire' - and why did no other college in the NATION try to recruit Sandusky?

The entire Wikipedia administrator system is flawed. There is no rule of law at Wikipedia. There is no administrator accountability to other editors.

You have no right to re-interpret the specific rules about making legal threats.

I've actually known this one for a while but this came up recently in discussion: So BPD is a COMBINATION of a naturally highly emotionally personality with a failure to learn coping mechanisms to manage them (especially during childhood/adolescence when most people learn those coping mechanisms). There's actually a ton of super emotional people out there who *did* learn effective coping mechanisms as children. One example is people who do a shit ton of scrapbooking or make pinterest boards or those magazine-clipping vision boards. I feel like that kind of person often gets a bad rap and it's kind of something people associate with middle-aged housewives. Here's the thing though. They're using it to express their individuality and hold onto their sense of self. It's a coping mechanism. You could learn something from them. Anyway that's tonight's rant.,Safe/Neutral

"` == ``Jewish settlements`` map == I'm removing the ``Jewish settlements`` map because it is hardly NPOV: * The yellow area is unlabeled, but when viewed together with the partition map, one get the impression that the yellow area is all populated by Arabs. In fact, much of it (including the entire southern Negev) was virtually unpopulated. Overall, the map creates the impression that Palestine was an Arab land, with a tiny scattered Jewish community. In fact, as the text of the article states, the population was approximately 1/3 Jewish. * It uses the term ``settlements``, thus ignoring Jewish population living in the land for centuries in cities like Jerusalem, Safed, and Tiberias. Also, the term ``settlements`` has gained certain connotations in recent years, since it's applied to Jewish population in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.`",Safe/Neutral
This is a major issue for me. I'm just about to graduate school too and I'm looking for a job. I find that I'll start off keeping really close track of what I spend. But then there's something in my head that says 'fuck it' when I'm stressed I'll start spending more and more and get really anxious about keeping track about how much I'm spending and then I'll get even more anxious. When that feeling of emptiness or boredom comes one of my major things is to spend my way out of it. I'm glad I am starting to notice this.

I was rushed to hospital and spent three nights there before they thought it was safe for me to come home. The weight of everything was too much. I'm feeling everything and nothing.

"I dissociate with daydreams and it happens without even trying. In these daydreams, it's always will fall back to some sort of pain I felt and what I feel like I should have done. Fight back, what I should have said, what I should I have did, etc. I've been trying to control it by not allowing myself to fall into those thoughts because when they do, I get upset. I've been noticably happier. Constantly reminding myself that these things aren't real, that these arguments have not yet happened, and that I'll deal with the problems when they're real. The day dreams are rather comparable to self harm urges. They come and go. I was wondering if anyone else had these and had any way to stopping it.",Emotional Distress

Thanks for your reply. I hear that from a lot of people about kids giving them hope. Being without kids though I can't really relate to that one very much. I hear ya on music though.

Caitlin Summars I don't think I was being biased. I was being very understanding to both sides. In your first comment you definitely were being one sided. Considering you yourself struggle with mental illness I can't understand your lack of empathy. You stated in your first comment a diabetic illness can take a life unlike a chemical imbalance. That's all you said. No explanation & I completely disagreed with that & no one should prefer to be labeled crazy.

"`The actual idea behind time-out is to get the parent to cool-off. They are the real problem in a confrontation. It's rare that children need to ``cool off``. The theory behind adult time-outs is that you deprive the child of your attention. Of course, in our electronic gadget society where children hardly ever see their parents anyways, that accomplishes nothing. So as a replacement for spending time with one's child and paying attention to them most of the time, someone invented the ``child time-out`` as a form of punishment instead. This is not an acceptable trade-off and that's why child time-outs are bad. They're still better than physical abuse of course. Ark`",Safe/Neutral

Your suffering is not less valid in that scenario, because it's still suffering. I hope this helps some of you who are struggling with this.",Emotional Distress

Long distance however things get complicated as she requires more to feel appreciated and admired than I.

it's basically pessimistic and optimistic views- you tend to find yourself agreeing w/ one side more than the other. actually the reason they haven't is a programming mess up. it happens because of the ps3's complexity apparently?? you can look it up. if you want Daedric anything you have to smith it now. but you can find dremora to kill in Mehrunes Dagon's quest. they respawn every few days- good place for the hearts to forge armor with.,Safe/Neutral
