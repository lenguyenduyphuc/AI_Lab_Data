It was a financial problem, quite fixable, but I just couldn't handle it. I tied myself a noose and everything. I was going to do it. I was all alone in the house with my dog, so there was really no one that would be able to stop me. I didn't do anything, but I felt like I could have done it completely on impulse over a fixable problem, leaving behind everything I love and my hopeful future. I feel it now too, creeping up on me. Everything should be fine, but I can't help the feeling that I should just do it, like everything would be easier for everyone if they would just realize how little they need me.",

I cannot connect with any of my coworkers because I look and act strange to them. I know I am supposed to wait on these hormones, but I am really scared. What if they don't work? What if I'll get beaten up? What if I lose my job due to just being me? I want to be happy, but it's so hard. It's gotten to the point where all I do is just think about death and hope maybe I will get a do-over. I just can't take any of this anymore.",

I have attempted in the past, but at the last moment either I live through it just in a hellblaze of pain becoming an even bigger failure, or my body stops me. My mind screams to do it, but sometimes my body just stops me. Sometimes my body will give up on life and I'll lay there wanting to shed a tear, yet I know no one will care, so I lay quietly in the darkness for days on end. I try to drown out the voices with all I have left, music, but recently I don't care to listen to all I have to do what has stuck with me for all my life. I am ready to listen to the voices, I'm ready to listen to my inner shouts. If only I had easier access to guns, my life would be so much harder, but I don't. Instead, I have to go out in either a more painful way. I hope others continue to have the will to carry on, but sadly I think I lost mine.",

    "input": "Just got in a car accident and I wish it had been worse and that I had gotten fatally injured when I was driving. Sometimes I imagine just crashing into something and dying. I have had some close calls recently with other drivers and I often think afterward that I wish they had ended up hitting me. I don't know why I feel like this. I've been taking sertraline, the generic version of Zoloft, which has stopped me from feeling horrible on a normal day-to-day basis. But whenever something out of the ordinary happens, like this car accident or I mess something up, it's like I had never taken the meds. I feel like I both want to and don't want to die. These last couple of years have been horrible for me, but I still have dreams and want to do things. Before I started taking the sertraline, I was actively planning my death, but now it's like I feel half wanting to keep going and half wanting to die before my life moves forward too much. This car accident is going to cost me and my family a lot of money, and it's all my fault. Maybe they would have gotten some compensation if I had died. If I wasn't around anymore, they would be sad, but I also wouldn't be able to disappoint them and cost them more than they can afford anymore. I am a terrible daughter.",

I myself am not suicidal, I would say, even if I think about it more often than not, to just quit, go the 'pussy but easy' way. Why should I struggle with life instead of going the easy route? Personally, I think it's because mankind fears the unknown. We don't know what's after death because none really came back from actual death and reported about it, like actual clinical dead. But is this really the only reason? Like, I know I am not going to kill myself yet, and it probably stays that way because I am just too much of a pussy to be a pussy, if you get what I mean.",

Something unrelated one day made me remember everything. It all came flooding back into my mind and it was like I was reliving it all and felt like I was having a never-ending panic attack for about 4 days. This buried trauma explained a lot about why my alcohol, pornography, and cigarette usages were all insanely high to the point they fucked up my life and relationships with people close to me in significant ways. I am afraid to talk about what happened to anyone, even people I trust like my family or a potential therapist, due to extreme irrational paranoia about the people involved finding out and hurting me again. And sometimes I am just completely consumed by negative, horrible thoughts and can't escape them. I tried getting a sliding scale therapist a couple years ago and even then gave up on the idea of therapy. I don't know what to do. I don't want to give up.",

I have done absolutely everything I can to pick myself up: therapy, psychiatrist, Lexapro, quit drinking, quit smoking, started working out, started eating right, started traveling, focused on work, and even started hobbies. Despite all this, sometimes it feels like nothing is helping. I can barely get out of bed most days. I am on the verge of tears every day. It is difficult to do anything. It's even hard to write this post. I don't know what to do anymore. I wake up every day feeling like I am being tortured. It's been 5 months and it is driving me nuts, feeling like I can't escape.

    "input": "Standing in a supermarket line, I was thinking, 'How does it feel to jump off a high-story building?' I've read stories that during the fall it makes you feel alive due to a sudden surge of adrenaline. Okay, back to the supermarket, a few more people to go. Then I thought, 'Will this ever stop feeling like a total zombie?' I got out of the store, sat on a public bus, thinking how I am institutionalized and tied to a hospital bed in psych wards, lol. Okay, I'm back on the bus. I've been dealing with this crap for 5 years. I totally have no energy remaining. I have a job that requires working part-time from home; I do my job and fall asleep immediately. Last session, my psych told me that there is no working medicine for me because we've tried everything. I'm currently on a low dose of SSRI and benzo. My real-world productivity is literally 0. I sometimes go out for a drink with friends, feeling like depersonalized shit, begging from inside that they stop talking to me because I have no power to engage in conversation.",
