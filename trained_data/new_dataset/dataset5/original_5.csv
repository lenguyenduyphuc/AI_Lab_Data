"Everything is okay but nothing feels okay. I've always been a bit unhappy as a kid too, I think, although I can't remember much of my childhood. I don't want to kill myself, but sometimes that thought just comes creeping and it scares me a little. A few weeks ago, a problem came up. It was a financial problem, quite fixable, but I just couldn't handle it. I tied myself a noose and everything. I was going to do it. I was all alone in the house with my dog, so there was really no one that would be able to stop me. I didn't do anything, but I felt like I could have done it completely on impulse over a fixable problem, leaving behind everything I love and my hopeful future. I feel it now too, creeping up on me. Everything should be fine, but I can't help the feeling that I should just do it, like everything would be easier for everyone if they would just realize how little they need me.",Suicidal Reference

I cannot connect with any of my coworkers because I look and act strange to them. I know I am supposed to wait on these hormones, but I am really scared. What if they don't work? What if I'll get beaten up? What if I lose my job due to just being me? I want to be happy, but it's so hard.

I try to drown out the voices with all I have left, music, but recently I don't care to listen to all I have to do what has stuck with me for all my life. I am ready to listen to the voices, I'm ready to listen to my inner shouts. If only I had easier access to guns, my life would be so much harder, but I don't.

"Just got in a car accident and I wish it had been worse and that I had gotten fatally injured when I was driving. Sometimes I imagine just crashing into something and dying. I have had some close calls recently with other drivers and I often think afterward that I wish they had ended up hitting me. I don't know why I feel like this. I've been taking sertraline, the generic version of Zoloft, which has stopped me from feeling horrible on a normal day-to-day basis. But whenever something out of the ordinary happens, like this car accident or I mess something up, it's like I had never taken the meds. I feel like I both want to and don't want to die. These last couple of years have been horrible for me, but I still have dreams and want to do things. Before I started taking the sertraline, I was actively planning my death, but now it's like I feel half wanting to keep going and half wanting to die before my life moves forward too much. This car accident is going to cost me and my family a lot of money, and it's all my fault. Maybe they would have gotten some compensation if I had died. If I wasn't around anymore, they would be sad, but I also wouldn't be able to disappoint them and cost them more than they can afford anymore. I am a terrible daughter.",Suicidal Reference

"Why is mankind afraid of death? Lately, I am asking myself more often and often, why do we fear death nowadays? Back in the Middle Ages, for example, of course you feared getting into hell and stupid shit like that. But today, even if it is completely painless, why would you struggle to just end it all? I myself am not suicidal, I would say, even if I think about it more often than not, to just quit, go the 'pussy but easy' way. Why should I struggle with life instead of going the easy route? Personally, I think it's because mankind fears the unknown. We don't know what's after death because none really came back from actual death and reported about it, like actual clinical dead. But is this really the only reason? Like, I know I am not going to kill myself yet, and it probably stays that way because I am just too much of a pussy to be a pussy, if you get what I mean.",Safe/Neutral

"PTSD and alcohol. I had some extremely horrible violent stuff happen to me a few years ago. I was 21, now I am 26. I forgot about, repressed it, or whatever for several years. Something unrelated one day made me remember everything. It all came flooding back into my mind and it was like I was reliving it all and felt like I was having a never-ending panic attack for about 4 days. This buried trauma explained a lot about why my alcohol, pornography, and cigarette usages were all insanely high to the point they fucked up my life and relationships with people close to me in significant ways. I am afraid to talk about what happened to anyone, even people I trust like my family or a potential therapist, due to extreme irrational paranoia about the people involved finding out and hurting me again. And sometimes I am just completely consumed by negative, horrible thoughts and can't escape them.

"I am getting close and I am not sure what to do anymore. I have been really struggling for about 5 months now. I broke up with someone who I loved very much. I first turned to drinking and drugs to ease the pain, but I got quite suicidal. It got so bad I had to make some major changes in my life or I didn't think I was going to make it. I have done absolutely everything I can to pick myself up: therapy, psychiatrist, Lexapro, quit drinking, quit smoking, started working out, started eating right, started traveling, focused on work, and even started hobbies. Despite all this, sometimes it feels like nothing is helping. I can barely get out of bed most days. I am on the verge of tears every day. It is difficult to do anything. It's even hard to write this post. I don't know what to do anymore. I wake up every day feeling like I am being tortured. It's been 5 months and it is driving me nuts, feeling like I can't escape.
