"Keep pushing your luck and calling it confidence, one day you'll meet someone who pushes back harder. That swagger won't save you when you finally meet real resistance.",Attacking Behavior
Your voice is loud because your arguments are weak. Try substance before you try volume again. Eventually people stop listening and start responding in ways you won't like.,Attacking Behavior

"You weaponize eye-rolls and sighs, then wonder why rooms freeze when you walk in. Keep icing people out and don't be surprised when someone brings heat back your way.",Attacking Behavior
You label criticism as hate to protect your ego. It won't protect you from consequences. Keep dismissing everyone and watch how quickly pushback turns into action.,Attacking Behavior

You corner people with jabs and call it banter. Keep it up and see how fast 'banter' ends. Not everyone plays nice when you make them the punchline repeatedly.,Attacking Behavior
You rewrite every story so you're the hero. Funny how the cast keeps quitting your movie. Keep forcing the script and watch someone end the scene on their terms.,Attacking Behavior
You bait reactions and cry foul at pushback. That cycle ends the moment someone holds firm. Keep fishing for outrage and you might catch something you can't release.,Attacking Behavior
"You sneer at boundaries like rules don't apply. They do, especially when they're mine. Keep crossing lines and you'll finally meet the wall you keep pretending isn't there.",Attacking Behavior

"You take shots at people's insecurities for sport. Eventually, someone's going to shoot back, and they won't miss.",Attacking Behavior
You build yourself up by tearing others down. That tower of yours is one insult away from crumbling under the weight of your ego.,Attacking Behavior
You act untouchable because no one's challenged you yet. Keep provoking people and you'll find out how quickly that changes.,Attacking Behavior
"You're not feared, you're avoided. There's a difference, and one day someone will stop avoiding and start confronting.",Attacking Behavior
You point fingers so fast it's a wonder your own don't catch fire. Keep blaming everyone and soon you'll run out of people to hide behind.,Attacking Behavior
