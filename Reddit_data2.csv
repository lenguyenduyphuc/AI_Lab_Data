- He then proceeds to cry and manipulate me saying I’m just messed up and I really struggle but if you want to make it work we can because I think we can make it work no matter what anyone says ( which means his people are being haters and talking mess per usual) and then he’s like we need to move back in together because we can’t make it work living apart

 and then we started to really get along and call every night, eventually we’d fall asleep on the phone every single night unless something came up, my parents didn’t know because they didn’t want me to date until i was 18 and it had to be approved by them, but he wasn’t Christian liek them and he didn’t grow up with a good family so he was kinda on his own but living with his dad still, he’s only a few months older than me so we’re the same age currently, only 18
we sent explicit photos and videos, my mom ended up seeing when we got caught, eventually he saved enough money to come visit me January, we got along SO WELL like perfect, we didn’t argue and if we did it was small and we talk it out, 
 so i lied to my parents, a lot, i feel terrible and sad about that part, i ended up sneaking him in my room on the church property because my dad is a pastor :/, and he stayed for a week in my room until my sister found him and i got in trouble, my parents yelled and cried and yelled so much at me, they were heart broke and shocked i’d do such a thing, i understand and feel terrible about it."

wanted to do was design and make video games, but growing up my dad had always shit on those dreams, said they were stupid and that it wasn’t a good field to go in and that I needed to wake up and smell the coffee, he was more interested in me playing baseball or football, now I did like baseball at first but my dad would always point out the negatives about everything I ever did, when I hit the 8th grade I started playing football as part of my schools elective and I didn’t enjoy it fully as I was being constantly harassed and bullied by other classmates and I wasn’t very well liked because of a few words my 5th grade teacher said about me, eventually we moved to another state and my dad wanted me to play football but I had no interest and he very well knew it, but my new school actually seemed to care and got me out and I no longer had to play football anymore and I was happier then I could ever be, but in high school I didn’t care about my grades so I didn’t study or do homework which I do regret after high school and I was 18 I had plans to go to college no breaks no nothing I was gonna go and work hard to make sure every penny spent was worth it, I took my act in high school when it was offered free but apparently my school lost it or something so I wound up having to take a compass test which was essentially a placement test, it was hard but I didn’t score high enough to be in full fledged courses but it worked hard enough I could be in full classes next semester i was excited I was going to have a degree in computer science and start my path into video game design but when I told my dad about the schedule he got angry, told me it was a “female private part area” fucking schedule and that I might as well quit rip it up and go work at McDonald’s as he wasn’t going to pay for it, my biggest regret in life was not telling him to go fuck himself and just taking out loans to go to school and do everything alone, I decided a year off then finding a job to work but as time went on I started to gain massive amounts of weight and fast it didn’t help that my dad was always buying fast food and I never worked out or did anything to stop myself, I eventually in 2017 got a job as a dishwasher in a friend’s family restaurant not even a month into working there and I got the “is this the career you want?, do you really wanna spend the rest of your life washing dishes?” Type speech, I eventually quit and lied about me quitting and just let it go years go by and I gain more weight and occasionally I did truly hunt for work and had some interviews but why would you hire someone whos really over weight who didn’t look like he could handle the work load, I would say I have my own truck but o don’t it’s a GMC Sierra 1500 year model 2000 it’s nothing new but I live the truck over time it’s had issues with batteries dying and the windows stopped working not wanting to roll down or up barely making sound when the switch is used, and not to long ago when starting it there was a giant leak of water from the radiator I believe not sure, but I didn’t touch the truck or try to start it because of that cause I personally don’t know if it’s even safe my dad knows this but takes his opportunities to attack me about being lazy about the truck, I was lazy and still am I sat around not really wanting to do anything but play video games and eat, I eventually got to 435 pounds and was pressured into having gastric sleeve surgery to loose wait after 6 months of dieting and exercise, I kept that routine up and eventually I did have a set back and gained a good bit of the weight back but I got back at it and lost it all again, but over the years I’ve stolen $1000 from his emergency cash stash and used it on sweets and soda and I was happier than I had ever been cause I felt like the true me but it came to head when he finally confronted me and I confessed, I have a job now and am putting cash in an envelope to hand him when I’ve earned all of it everything but $60 for gas will be going it until I’ve paid him back but regardless he gave me hell about my current job, hated it and even threatened to withhold the use of the truck because of the money I took which i have recognized it was wrong and am working to correct the mistake but he regardless of the money his behavior has not changed, he has made threats to physically hurt me my whole life, don’t wanna play football I’ll beat you till your laying in a pool of your own blood l, stuff like that, I’m working to rectify my theft of his money but he is also the reason I have sworn off women and ever having my own family I don’t want to be like him and do the same to my sons or even daughters, I think after I’ve paid him back and a little more I’m going no contact and leaving with my dog to a friend who is gonna help me get my life together he’s gonna be strict give me a place to stay and help me with work and teach me how to be an adult it’s going to be one long ride and one day I will have to answer to god why I took from my dad, i am tired and want to start my life but I don’t know if a wife or children will ever be a part of my life I’m thinking about leaving and cutting contact with my family I’m a 26 male, my whole life all I’ve ever wanted to do was design and make video games, but growing up my dad had always shit on those dreams, said they were stupid and that it wasn’t a good field to go in and that I needed to wake up and smell the coffee, he was more interested in me playing baseball or football, now I did like baseball at first but my dad would always point out the negatives about everything I ever did, when I hit the 8th grade I started playing football as part of my schools elective and I didn’t enjoy it fully as I was being constantly harassed and bullied by other classmates and I wasn’t very well liked because of a few words my 5th grade teacher said about me, eventually we moved to another state and my dad wanted me to play football but I had no interest and he very well knew it, but my new school actually seemed to care and got me out and I no longer had to play football anymore and I was happier then I could ever be, but in high school I didn’t care about my grades so I didn’t study or do homework which I do regret after high school and I was 18 I had plans to go to college no breaks no nothing I was gonna go and work hard to make sure every penny spent was worth it, I took my act in high school when it was offered free but apparently my school lost it or something so I wound up having to take a compass test which was essentially a placement test, it was hard but I didn’t score high enough to be in full fledged courses but it worked hard enough I could be in full classes next semester i was excited I was going to have a degree in computer science and start my path into video game design but when I told my dad about the schedule he got angry, told me it was a “female private part area” fucking schedule and that I might as well quit rip it up and go work at McDonald’s as he wasn’t going to pay for it, my biggest regret in life was not telling him to go fuck himself and just taking out loans to go to school and do everything alone, I decided a year off then finding a job to work but as time went on I started to gain massive amounts of weight and fast it didn’t help that my dad was always buying fast food and I never worked out or did anything to stop myself, I eventually in 2017 got a job as a dishwasher in a friend’s family restaurant not even a month into working there and I got the “is this the career you want?, do you really wanna spend the rest of your life washing dishes?” Type speech, I eventually quit and lied about me quitting and just let it go years go by and I gain more weight and occasionally I did truly hunt for work and had some interviews but why would you hire someone whos really over weight who didn’t look like he could handle the work load, I would say I have my own truck but o don’t it’s a GMC Sierra 1500 year model 2000 it’s nothing new but I live the truck over time it’s had issues with batteries dying and the windows stopped working not wanting to roll down or up barely making sound when the switch is used, and not to long ago when starting it there was a giant leak of water from the radiator I believe not sure, but I didn’t touch the truck or try to start it because of that cause I personally don’t know if it’s even safe my dad knows this but takes his opportunities to attack me about being lazy about the truck, I was lazy and still am I sat around not really wanting to do anything but play video games and eat, I eventually got to 435 pounds and was pressured into having gastric sleeve surgery to loose wait after 6 months of dieting and exercise, I kept that routine up and eventually I did have a set back and gained a good bit of the weight back but I got back at it and lost it all again, but over the years I’ve stolen $1000 from his emergency cash stash and used it on sweets and soda and I was happier than I had ever been cause I felt like the true me but it came to head when he finally confronted me and I confessed, I have a job now and am putting cash in an envelope to hand him when I’ve earned all of it everything but $60 for gas will be going it until I’ve paid him back but regardless he gave me hell about my current job, hated it and even threatened to withhold the use of the truck because of the money I took which i have recognized it was wrong and am working to correct the mistake but he regardless of the money his behavior has not changed, he has made threats to physically hurt me my whole life, don’t wanna play football I’ll beat you till your laying in a pool of your own blood l, stuff like that, I’m working to rectify my theft of his money but he is also the reason I have sworn off women and ever having my own family I don’t want to be like him and do the same to my sons or even daughters, I think after I’ve paid him back and a little more I’m going no contact and leaving with my dog to a friend who is gonna help me get my life together he’s gonna be strict give me a place to stay and help me with work and teach me how to be an adult it’s going to be one long ride and one day I will have to answer to god why I took from my dad, i am tired and want to start my life but I don’t know if a wife or children will ever be a part of my life "

offmychest,mental_health,suicide,I spent my life fighting to survive with dreams of someday feeling alive and I never will have the chance,"I spent my life fighting to survive with dreams of someday feeling alive and I never will have the chance My body is dying, my brain is alive, and I'm only 27y/o

All of my life I've fought alone, I lived in the projects with my mother not being in my life and my father trying his best but was never around

So I pushed through all of the horrors and managed to graduate high school even after not completing a single class in my junior year because I was in-and-out of a psych hospital for 4 months because of 3 suicide attempts

I was given my old medical records a few months ago and apparently had taken an IQ test while I was inpatient and was never told my score - apparently I was well into the genius level with a note from doctor that it would most likely be higher if I was in a less shattered state of mind

I can't ever claim to have considered myself dumb, and I have an unmeasured but obviously apparent EQ as well. I am hyper analytical and perceptive of the world and the people in it, to the point that I could read any person's emotional state just by their presence

It made me incredibly introverted as I am an empath I would feel the pain of those around me and the pain of living in this fucked up world and it was too much to bare so I would hide myself away because I couldn't turn it off and I couldn't cope with it either

I wanted to do something go in this world, I wanted to be able to fight for those who grew up in even worse situations than me, I wanted to help millions of people in even less developed countries  because I knew the pain of never having help

I tried to go to college like I was supposed to, and would have had maximum financial aid but my grandfather passed away the year before I started and left my father money which was promptly stolen in a legal dispute from a greedy aunt, yet it showed his income as much higher for that year

I was told that I would receive no financial aid as a result, so I reversed my decision to go but they promised my naïve self that they could fix it and it's a common thing that happens, so I decided I would still go, a month before I was supposed to begin they told me they couldn't fix it and I once again reversed my decision, and shame on me but I fell for it again when they told me they could fix it

As I needed to register for classes I signed up, moved into a dorm, and was told they couldn't do anything about it and I'd need to take out private loans, $28k in total for 1-year of college that I medically withdrew from after planned suicide attempt in my second semester

I went inpatient again, but because of the private loans stipulations if I was out of school for 6 months I would be required to pay them back, because of the timing of when classes next started and when I went into the hospital, that 6 months hit where I was ""out-of-school"" and the private loans placed a hold on my transcripts and restricted me from applying anywhere else, and blocked my from registering for classes until I paid them off

I did the only option I could and looked for work, and because of my terrible emotional state I was rejected from even gas station jobs because my heart just wanted to be able to use my brain and not waste away behind a counter but I had no access, no connections, no financial help

I eventually had one hiring manager at a retailer give me a chance and I rapidly climbed to an assistant manager role after 6 months having no prior experience because of my ability to handle so much, I had fought all of my life so a busy and overloaded work day wasn't daunting, it was just my norm

I rode my success and with my ability to work with and understand people and what they wanted to hear I managed to work at Microsoft with no degree at only 21 and rode that throughout Covid - I had finally started to make it, I was making the most I ever had but my city is in the top 3 most expensive places to live in the US and I still struggled financially

But I managed, I worked two jobs to try and pay off the student loan debt faster while also completely supporting myself with no aid from family

I continued to develop my skills and I continued fighting my way upwards in corporate, with the dreams that someday I would make enough to have breathing room and finally escape the life of poverty

But as soon as I starting making more, the unpaid hospitals bills from 4 inpatient stays came back to haunt me - $60k in debt with nothing to show for but being alive to pay off the debt

So I fought for the last 7 years and I've still been fighting - I have $10k of debt left, I make slightly over 6 figures and I still have never had the chance to breath and because of this fucked up economy and the greed of the ultra rich I can't get promoted fast enough anymore to make enough to save and I've only been surviving and living paycheck to paycheck

And I know this isn't unique but I had set a goal 7 years ago to pay it all off and then start to build a life for myself then, I scarified having relationships, having friends, spending time with family, and really any forms of happiness because I just wanted to be free and give myself the chance to LIVE and not just SURVIVE

I was so close, I was so fucking close to finally getting to a networth of 0, I had fought for my life with not a single dollar of support from anyone, and I was counting down the months until I would make that final payment

But over the last few months I had begun developing pain in my back and just kept working and fighting through it, I'd wake up in pain, go to sleep in pain, but in my mind I just wanted to be free of the debt so kept on pushing myself anyway, pain be damned

Until 2 weeks ago when the pain had reached a point where I couldn't sit at my desk anymore without feeling a fire in my back, and I finally went to the doctor - my reluctance from doing it sooner was the fear of more medical bills after I had been working so hard to pay them off

Well hindsight is 2020 and maybe things would be different if I stopped fighting but come to find out I have stage 3 lung cancer

I've still been processing it, and maybe i'll survive, but I've simply lost the will too

27 years of fighting without reprieve, 27 years of trying to see above the water line, 27 years of dreaming of someday not being in the noose that is money, and 27 years wasted with no friends and most of my family already gone

All I wanted to do was help people, all I wanted to do was break away from this fucked up game of money, I just wanted to feel an ounce of freedom

and now my outcomes are simply die or fight more, possibly live, and restart my nightmare of leaving medical debt as we go into another financial crisis and I still have no financial support or savings

I just wanted to feel alive and be able to live an average life and I got neither

I've lost my will to live and my will to keep fighting, this world is so fucked up and I can still realize my situation is far from the worst and there are people out there who suffer even more and will continue to because of this horrible fucked up game of money

I explained the whole situation to my ex, told him every single thing that the doctor said, told him that I even could have a miscarriage and in 15 days we would find out everything, I begged him to not tell his mom just yet and wait till we're in the clear with the pregnancy, but he refused, he told me that he didn't care what his mom would think about me and that he would tell his mom no matter what cause it was too hard and too much stress and anxiety for him to handle (again, like I wasn't going through the same thing or even worse cause It was all inside of me) I gave up begging and I was not up to fight him so my bestie Jolene tried put some senses into his mind, he ignored us all, went to his city and told his mom, that made me so much more stressed and gave tons of new anxiety, yesterday he sent me and audio saying he was super relieved and feeling Allright now cause his momma told him that my pregnancy wasn't even going to be viable cause she couldn't see a fetus in the ultrasound and I was going to miscarry it anyways (keep in mind this woman never even worked or studied anything in the medical field) and she also went as far as showing her old ultrasounds to prove to him her point, man that got me so goddammit mad cause like, she isn't a doctor, she doesn't have any idea on how to read the exams, not all pregnancy's are the same and ALSO, how cruel can you be to be cheering for me to have a miscarriage, don't get me wrong reddit, this was a total unplanned pregnancy and in the beginning I was also hoping for an abortion, but with some time, all the talks that I had with my ex and probably the hormones kicking in I started to somehow feel a kind of affection for this thing inside me and I started to get used with the idea of being a mom, so even though it might seam unreasonable of me, it hurted to see Joe and His mom hope and even cheer for an miscarriage, it felt insensitive of them."

In particular, by making Jack of the ""Jack and the Giant Beanstalk"" story an actual child instead of an older teenager/young man it erased the arc of him actually growing into his age and maturing

* Babylon was overlong and the team behind it greatly overestimated audience's willingness to endure such indulgent debauchery, specifically debauchery that feels dirty

In Suicide Squad, Peacemaker goes off on a long rant about the bag of dicks joke

Instead, she notes, it triggers a stress response in their brain that leads to heightened anxiety — which can stand in the way of their ability to learn and develop, [studies show](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Persistent-Fear-and-Anxiety-Can-Affect-Young-Childrens-Learning-and-Development.pdf)."

rant,mental_health,anxiety,Vent about my life (warning very long),"So this is gonna be a long one- basically my family is the literal definition of ‘dysfunctional’- to expand on this basically until I was like 10 (around when my parents divorced) my father was horribly abusive towards us, not that my mother was any better it’s just that while my mother had her many physical bout of abuse she was more of the ‘scar them emotionally’ type, but anyways shit happened as usual and I’ve ran away (though most of the time it was me being coerced by my older sister) and eventually my parents got divorced when my older sister made up a bull faced lie that my father did inappropriate shit with her (to clarify they are not related- I have 3 siblings I live with and only me and my little sister share the same dad while my older brother and older sister brother have 2 diff dads) so my dad eventually got out on the street but now he would do ANYTHING to keep us safe and he foolishly forgave my sister for her bullshit (I feel really guilty about resenting her fortaking my dad away from me even though he wasn’t the best of fathers) I love my dad with my whole heart but that doesn’t heal old wounds
Now to my siblings- my older brother has a horrible short temper with anger problems though now they are significantly better, but in the past I was always the target of his anger- ie I was the one who was kicked down onto the floor, shoved into closets, chased with knives, and so on and so forth- however he was always coddled as ‘mommies only boy’ on top of being the precious oldest
My older sister is someone who has a multitude of problems such as BPD, short temper, ADHD, pathological liar, attention seeking, and so much more-
I used to be pretty damn close to her as we are the closets in terms of age and how we are both girls (me and my brother both have a 2 years gap between my older sister) but I was always the target of her bullying- now don’t get me wrong my brother was worse in terms of constantly fat shaming me (I’m perfectly average in terms of my height and age) however my sister always took it a step further in other things such as always getting me in trouble and making me seem as if I was the bag guy (ie a childhood nickname of mine was “cockroach girl” because my sibling, particularly my sister, would always blame me for stealing food) (I am also HORRIBLE with pain so when we had the punishment rounds ie horrible bare ass spanking with chunky rings that usually ended up on the back instead till someone confessed- I always fell first and took the blame) my sister doesn’t really particularly “bully” me anymore and she has gotten nicer however she is pretty much an alcoholic and (past) druggie who is constantly vamping or smoking a blunt- (my nose is really sensitive so it is actually painful when I smell things like weed) 
my younger sister is 4 years younger than me and was the sweet youngest who could never do any wrong- I feel bad about it but I also resent her for never having to endure any of the abuse us older three had to endure- in fact she was so babied that until a few months ago she didn’t even know how to make a literal sandwich- and just like 2? For some reason like I mean literal blocks of cheese- it’s weird, candy and chips- and he has a way of ALWAYS trying to make himself seem as though he is the victim- constantly bringing up his dead child, my cousin, thankfully it has stopped since I got my dad to bring it up to them as the simple mention of his name was enough to make me break down- 
Now my biggest problem with them is these 3 things, 1 they used to CONSTANTLY have sex under me while I tried to sleep (thankfully it’s stopped now as once again I got my dad involved- though now I have some trauma from that and can’t sleep in the same room as them anymore and have a huge habit of making my presence known to them in dark rooms such as constant tapping, talking to myself, or shining lights- 2 my mother and her boy toy husband are ALWAYS pocketing the child support from my dad- so much so that while they went out on dates and shit we had literally no food in the house- now I don’t mean the whole “oh there IS that but I don’t want it” I mean quite literally the fridge and pantry were bare bones- even now the fridge doesn’t work- the oven is broken- and while they are up in a different city for her husbands hospitalization my older siblings (mainly brother) are having to play parent with me and my little sister
We have no food in the house, no money, nothing- my dad and brother are using their own money from their jobs to scavenge take out for us and we don’t even know when the two will be back-
Now me- yes I’m a problem too-
I had always been the one to be the last one picked, the one with the least presents on holidays, the one who was constantly left out or forgotten and it has left its mark on my life- I feel as though no one truly care about me and that I’m only around to fill the numbers- now I’m not perfect okay?"

J and A: Daddy Warbucks and mommy mom

\-J treats A like a mother in the sense he expects her to take care of him

\-A agrees to be js mommy bride because J financially supports her

\-This financial support creates a system of abuse; a is gaslit and verbally abused by j, and cannot retaliate in fear of financial withholding

\-j acts the age of an individual needing a mother, 4-11 years old (21 in actuality)

\-a lives knowing j will always act the way he acts

\-the entitlement of j begins to rub off on his victim, and a begins to turn into a j jr. Toxic relationships I am living with two friends from high school that were/are dating (j cheated on A multiple times but she was still willing to live with him so she avoids labeling anything between the two of them because being cheated on was one of her zero tolerance activities at the beginning of their relationship, but her living with him tells it wasn't that much of a policy) that fill this very specific relationship archetype that in my opinion, is as toxic for me, our fourth roommate, and the entire world as a whole as it is for the two of them."

(Sorry for no grammar),"We used to hangout for like weeks on end, he was super cool when I found out that they were getting evicted from their home I had to beg my mom to let the women stay with us my mom eventually agreed because she thought of friend as a son it took months of this women constantly getting abused and I'm talking physically abused before she moved out of their house and into our house (I should have known there was something wrong with her from the start) so after months of them staying in my room me trying to be as polite as possible to her and respect her cause I'm not a bad guy I'm 18 and new I need to watch what I say even though it was my house and I basically owned it by proxie of my grandma (my grandparents owned the house and we're letting my mom rent it) my friend was 17 we were supposed to be in school I was the only one actually attending school because his mom didn't know she actually had to put forth effort to re-enroll him (he was supposed to be enrolling at a school somewhere in another town because that's where they were staying for a while but now that he was staying with us we had to figure out what school he would be going to) anyway should have guessed she was a lazy piece of shit by then but one night I knock on the wall to come in (I accidentally walked in on her once but quickly walked out apologizing as there is no door) and ask if friend or friend's mom were hungry and I asked them to close window (friends mom was staying free of charge and already was making like more expensive for my mom which is typical I mean she comes into her house with two kids but I'm talking like $200 more in water and electricity) I didn't want her running up the bill later I knock again to see if friend was current he wasn't hungry he says yes and I ask her to close the window again she goes from 0 to 100 in 10 seconds like she was on something (and the only reason I thought that was because my dad was there and he knows the symptoms of drug abuse his brother did heroine for a short time but stopped) she screams at me calling me a child saying I shouldn't be in her room right now (please don't judge me but I had been dealing with this woman for quite some time and I've only been getting rudeness and disrespect from her) so I get out and yell back ""am I a child or a grown man!"" (Earlier that day she had told me that I was grown man and I should go unclog the toilet for her when she is a grown woman incapable of unclogging the toilet that she blames my little brother clogged) to say the least I told my mom what happened and she told me to take my brothers and go to my dad's house which I did this woman was being extremely aggressive towards me for no reason other than her back was hurting she wanted the cold air to soothe it even though she was putting two different ice hot things on her back and the heat is supposed to help her back but that's besides the point the next day my mom woke up and went to go talk with her and said ""friend's mom we need to talk"" friends mom ""yeah your son is controlling and disrespectful my mom was taken a back but stood firm ""no this isn't about my son you have a month to find a place to stay"" my mom said friend's mom ""oh that won't be necessary we're leaving today"" my mom tell her that the only reason she was allowed to stay here was that I begged friends mom says ""well it's his fault we're leaving anyway"" she then proceeded to take friend's phone and what me and all my friends assume (I know not a good thing to do but you have to keep in mind everyone knew friend really well he was an open book) and pretended to be him saying I was basically a horrible friend and that we are friends anymore stop contacting me my mom walks in (because at this point I was sharing everything that was going on to my mom and the texts because I wasn't going to school that day because of what was going on) and says ""your going to stop being friends with my son because of choice I made?!"" What Mom noticed though was that friend's mom had his phone at her feet and he was laying down and was suddenly shocked at this news but didn't want to say anything for fear of making things worse (friend has bad anxiety like me and worse social anxiety) so his mom in response to this cursed my mom out my mom being very calm took it and just waited for her to leave all the while friend's mom was telling friend ""you should tell her you should tell her"" like this was his fight too but he didn't say anything he hung his head low in disapproval of how his mom was acting because she was continuously cursing out my mom and continued to do so even when my dad technically owns the house by proxy of my grandmother as well swings by the crab stuff from my little brother for school he told my mom to stay calm and that she didn't have to take this she could call the cops my mom said thanks but let's not get the cops involved

And I find this very embarassing and let alone that I feel that this skill should be present within a child's age or that of a teenager's

I have a bit of an idea why I am still unable to form friendships or even want to form friendships and I think that it is mostly because I experienced a **LOT** of bullying when I was a kid/teeanger. And I do mean a lot and I mostly was not able to form even the simplest of friendships, let alone even go out during my adolescence and these repressed emotions and internalised beliefs about myself are still present within to this day

(it was way worse before because I happen to experience symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD and anger issues so I managed to at least get a hold of those but it is still an ongoing battle and I don't think that it will go away soon)

I think that the last time that I remember that I went out and actually had fun was in 2011 and I barely even go out at all, let alone even go out to a restuarant or even go abroad (last time I even went abroad was 10 years ago) and once again, as I am saying this, I feel embarassed and deeply ashamed of myself

I did try to speak out about this but I was slowly rejected afterwards and to be quite honest, I am not sure why people rejected me even more after that

Maybe I was being too needy?"

Tldr at the bottom

I wanna ask here cuz maybe adults who was/are parents would probably know what's toxic parenting and what's not
Sorry if it doesn't fit here

My mom was nice to me when I was in grade 1 but it suddenly stopped at around grade 2 or 3

So, for the passed years, whenever I got bad grades, my mom would complains or calling me stupid, but I dont remember a single time of her complimenting me for good grades, I could have just asked my mom for help when I dont understand something but I was scared since my sister(who easily gets angry and raises her voice more and more to the point of yelling at me when I still dont understand after ber explaining) and thought that she would be the same

I told my mom about the bullying situation at school but she only said ""punch the bully back"", which is a bad advice when you're the weakest kid in class, since she wont help, I didnt ask her for help about it since then and rely on my teacher and some of my classmates, after years of being bullied, it stopped at grade 6 or 7 after a parents meeting with the teacher, the teacher told my mom about the bullying situation and when she comes home, she didnt comfort me, instead she called me an idiot for not telling her anything about it

Not only that, after the final day elementary school(grade 5) and bout to move away, not seeing my old classmates again, they made a year book of us and gave us one each (before that day, they gave us a paper to write about our dream or who's your friends in class)  and at that time I was very shy but I talked and hanged out with some of the classmates few times before so I thought that the classmates I wrote in that section would also write my name, but no one did

Not a single classmate wrote my name, and my mom complained about me having no friends instead of comforting me about it

I have written diaries before and my mom just casually keep reading them without asking me or anything so I stopped doing that

Few days ago I got 1 on my math test, I came home and my parents complained about the grade, calling me stupid and said that they told me to study the day before test (which I did but then on that day I panicked and not sure if it's correct or not and forgot it all) and being very sensitive, I went to my room and tried not to cry or at least cry silently and not let my parents know
I stopped crying and left my room, sat in the living room but then my parents just start to complain again and again and insulting me, which made me get upset and ran to my room, locked the door and cried, my mom got mad and told me to unlock the door, after few times of her saying so, I unlocked the door and she got mad at me for crying, saying ""You haven't even got punish for the bad grade yet, and now you're crying?"" Something like that, then proceeded to grab a roll of plastic(dont know what it called in English so Im just gonna guess it) and hit me with it (the roll of plastic wasn't soft, it did hurt for few mins)   then she said ""Why are you crying?"" (Not in a good way)
I was scared and crying a lot, she then shouting at me(or is it called giving a lecture?-)  and then after a while she told me to go take a shower becuz I was stink

In the shower I can hear my parents saying something like taking away my phone (which made me more upset and sad since most of my friends are from the internet and I loved them a lot)
After the shower, I went back to my room and hugged my bodypillow and trying to calm down, I was starting to calm down but then my mom came in and did the same thing again but less shouting, after that, she gave me back my phone and told me to go to sleep, and left my room while I was still crying

Which made me think that my mom is starting being toxic but I remember few times of her letting me take a break from the afternoon classes or telling me if I feel too tired then I can ask to take a break on that day
Made me think again that it was probably just a normal strict parenting thing

Tldr:  my mom complained/insulted about my bad grades, about me not having any friends in class, when I didnt tell her about the bullying situation at class, not a single time congradulate me or compliment me for high grades or comforting me
But she does let me take breaks from classes

childfree,mental_health,trauma,If you are broke and are bringing kids into the world you are a child abuser ,"When you are brought up in poverty/dyfunction surrounding money such as:

- watching your parents have to choose between eating for the rest of the week or paying the light bill
- having to miss out on participating at events at school because your parents couldn’t afford it 
- being bullied by other kids because your clothes are old/worn etc
- not getting certain medical needs addressed like getting braces/glasses that can be a problem to your overall wellbeing 
- etc, etc you get the point

All of this inflicts pain and trauma on a young child and it can carry on even into their adult years where they may find making decisions exceptionally difficult because their whole life they were basically surviving in flight or flight mode

And coming from a limited or scarcity mindset is so hazardous on so many levels 

And when that’s all you have exposed your children to it can be exceptionally difficult for them to break out of that mold as they get older

So many people say that you don’t need to have money to have a child and I’ve never heard something more barbaric in my life

Breeders, especially get upset whenever these type of points are made because they want their little Brady Bunch but yet they’re on food stamps, constantly struggling to make ends meet and still want to pop out more and more kids when they are struggling to take care of the ones they already have 😑

While I’m not trying to shame people who have utilized government assistance it really makes no sense that if you are barely making it now without children, what on earth is going to make you believe that you can magically take care of yourself and kids if you have no or limited income? You’re basic moral obligation as a parent is literally just to protect and provide and it’s embarrassing if you can’t even do that much 

If a basic box of condoms is going to make your wallet dry, just imagine how the next 18 years (minimum) are gonna look…

TL;DR
nobody who is struggling has any business having children and you’re basically a child abuser because you’re inflicting mental and emotional pain and trauma on your child by having them grow up in poverty Which will affect them for all or the majority of their lives."

Pros (only if, they react positively):

-free ride 

-possible financial support (my parents are generally supportive so IF they react positively, they will want to help)

-just emotional support, i would definitely feel safer with my mom/my dad next to me

Cons (if they react negatively):

-they might get in my way of going by myself, or try to sabotage my bisalp if it gets scheduled 

-they might start to hate me for my decision

also: i have a long history of depression, anxiety, extremely destructive behaviours,and ive been dealing with autism and adhd since i was born-so i think its reasonable for me to make a decision that will make my life easier and more peaceful. you dont even have a boyfriend"" 

 i guess the answer is easy, not only in my country its illegal for a woman to get sterilized (obviously, a man can get a vasectomy here because,you know, misogyny) AND on top of that, abortion here is illegal (only can be done if its extremely deadly for a woman/result of rape-but even then, there have been multiple instances where women from my country literally died because nobody wanted to perform an abortion due to fear of regulations)."

Hi, I've been in a relationship for a month and a half now and I'm worried about what others say about the age difference (I'm 18M and he's 25M) many of my friends say that the age difference is grooming

But many people, especially my friends and acquaintances, are afraid that the age difference is completely wrong, that I'm a barely legal teenager and he's a fully developed person who already has a job and the like

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,online_safety,bullying,Would anyone here be interested in protesting an anti-feminist “women’s convention”?,"The convention encourages women to stop “acting like men” by demanding equal rights and opportunities because it is “against our ancient, biological nature as a woman.”

Its (all male) speakers are recruited from the global “manosphere.” Its creators believe feminism is “toxic,” “bullying,” “unhealthy,” and “militant.”

Single motherhood is described as just being a “broken family,” and apparently the worth of female youth is in our ability to bear children: 

>“Generations of women have been lied to with ‘you can have it all’, a clever way of tricking them into de-prioritizing motherhood until ~90% of their eggs are dead by 30.” Motherhood is described as a “sacred responsibility.”

Women are encouraged to be fit and traditionally feminine in order to satisfy the male gaze, from “the kitchen to the bedroom.”

I find this absolutely horrific and was wondering if anyone would be interested in protesting their encouragement of female submission, as if we have no value beyond our domestic life. Would anyone here be interested in protesting an anti-feminist “women’s convention”?"

Yet they march on regardless still
Standing strong of their own will

They believe in life's sanctity
And live outside of its cruelty
Their belief in love above all
Keeps them secure from any fall

They dress in what they wish
And care not for stylish swish
Caring nothing for designer flare
For them they wear what they dare. The law though they must abide
To do otherwise is legal suicide
But in time they'll wait their turn
As they watch society burn."

Now 2025 ,I’m pretty much dealing with the aftermath.it’s difficult and rewarding ,I have two children myself so I’m raising myself and my kids (single mom ) .Still trying to break cycles .ill be transparent,I was raised by an angry man and I became the angry man .Thank GOD ,I’ve  always been a cry baby lol and I’ve always had emotional intelligence.I know how to feel my emotions and get through them ,and sometimes I can dwell on them .I didn’t realize how bad my nervous system was when something good happened,I was irritable and mad because I was waiting on something bad to happen “ .so I’m still In therapy.i been in my spiritual journey for 4 years and I been using those techniques as well to help me heal and take accountability of my own healing .its been helping me to not only face that trauma ,but to understand it to and why it happened (pretty much realizing what’s done to me ,was done to them ) ,forgiveness didn’t come easily ,even me having the awareness that it happened to them too ,my pain from I just and grief because no one listened,no one protected me .i was rejected and exiled for speaking up for myself so I’m still in the path for forgiveness,but for myself not for them .MIND YOu…my mom is still playing mind games and now trying to get my seven year old daughter in the mix by grooming her ..this is not new ,BUT .im setting boundaries and not arguing over my boundaries,its been ALOT of action of my end .BUT I hit a breaking point today .i notice how,first of all ,I can’t control what she does .But I don’t have to deal with her crap either .So I set boundaries ,but I sit back and watch how she covertly bypasses me ,and get my daughter involved .i have my uncle (and aunt..not really a big help ) to pick up kids if they go over her house in some weekends she wants them ,and if I need ,or she needs to communicate something,which is not every time.my daughter has a free cellphone now ,and my mom been taking advantage of that ,and one again continue to cross boundaries.So I’ve been doing my research to see if I could do low contact legally ,like to have a third party because sometimes family can only do so much ,but my uncle has been doing a okay job ..it was one event that made me question them but I don’t have to trust them ,I them I need my them to respect my boundaries and he said okay ,but because I don’t know how long that’s going to last ..I’m looking to into that .But I notice how I been altering my entire life to manage this ,meanwhile she continues to play mind games and manipulate ,but again,I don’t argue ,I continue to set boundaries .so now Payton’s phone ,she’s don’t have them on week days ,now I choose a weekend or have to come up with a schedule.Bit because I’m aware I have free will I don’t have to deal with this ,just like grandpa ,took me to court and try to use money to get his way and still lost ,I’m not too worried about grandma either .i have options .that’s what’s helping me be grounded ,but it’s also to carry sometimes ,I have no community outside of my therapist for emotional support ,but I journal  ,I cry ,I do all my spiritual techniques to help me ground myself and bring that energy back toward me .My kids need me ."

nursing,mental_health,anxiety,Anxiety after employment gap ,"Anxiety after employment gap  Will try to keep this as brief as possible:

-Grew up super smart, top 1% of class in high school
-went to school for pre-pharmacy, had some financial issues and came back home, was depressed and lost for 2 years, didn’t know what to do and ended up going to nursing school as a “fuck it this is something whatever”

-ended up making some friends, graduating and working in a very challenging Trauma ICU

-started job hopping over the years, finished a dual degree in nursing administration and MBA in 2.5 years

-tried to quickly climb the ladder after that and crashed and burned at my last job as a director of a surgery center (had chest pains, went to ER, was stress related but all okay)

-after Chest pain event I quit my job and was home, taking care of health, got pregnant and now taking care of my toddler at home


All this to say, I am wanting to get back into the workfield, I have a 3 yr employment gap, all these “on paper” accomplishments and degrees..but I still feel like I have ptsd from my last job, I feel like my memory sucks, I don’t feel capable basically

The jobs I’m applying for either I’m “overqualified” on paper but I want to start again with the smaller jobs OR I get asked to interview for some big wig job which is what I want subconsciously but my anxiety kicks in big time (imposter syndrome, those memory issues, etc.)

Not sure how to get past this mentally..just venting I guess but wondering how to navigate these feelings. "

Preface
So a bit of background here i come from a not great family my parents where split, lived with an abusive mom who was a nurse so she knew how to hurt without leaving a mark or would lock me in a room for 8-20 hours a day without food or a way to use the bathroom 
This was my entire childhood but it came to a head when i turned 14
I started peeing myself, like a lot, on day my bladder would be fine and the next it wouldn't work for a whole week 
Obviously as a teenager this kinda broke me, and combined with my abuse i got very depressed, grades fell, i retreated from hobbies the whole nine yards
I thought i was cursed or dying, and my mother refused to take me to a doctor as she was convinced it was on purpose
Eventually after one particularly bad week, i broke down as school, got sent to the principals office, told them everything
They didn't believe, got arrested and the next several months where spent jumping between states custody, and the care of my father mother
Doctors where called to look at me and came up with a ""theres something wrong with his bladder but we don't know what"", and in their defense they had seen me twice, they decided to schedule some big multi scanner exam thing for my body
While the therapy place had sided with my mother, and decided i was nuts, this led to a judge ruling that i should spend the time between then, and my scan, within an inpatient facility, citing my failing grades and refusal to do therapy sessions with my mother. T was convinced i was a liar, that the abuse was take, that my bladder problems where some attempt at attention, and that my grades falling where laziness not depression 
And that meant that each time it happened, my punishments only got worse

my day to day, if i woke up dry was mostly normal, being talk down to, i had to keep track of it in that stupid journal they made us write in, ide be told things like what a big boy i was, literally treated like i was 3 or 4

If i woke up wet, well that was hell, and unfortunately a very common hell
First i would be yanked out of bed and screamed at by staff, and paraded in from of the other charges, ide be forced to admit what i did, and the staff would call me really awful shit, like a disgusting freak, or called a failure, or reminded that i was failing at something toddlers mastered
Then the other kids would be lined up to be loaded into the van and sent off for morning meds
But before could go i would have to go strip my bed and put it in the unit washer
If i was allowed to keep my clothes on they would still be my soaked night clothes, if i wasn't ide be taken into the bathroom stripped and forced into a pullup and gown
Then ide have to walk to the medical building like that no shoes, rarely socks

Once there, ide be stripped naked and put on a bed, sometimes with a bedpan, sometimes id be forced to just sit on a pad and deal with whatever happens
Firstly they drew blood regulardless and inspected my front and back door
And by inspect i mean shove random items unto
Started with catheters thermometers, ect
But as the months went by these tools got bigger eventually being replaces by fingers, sex toys, and well i think you know where this is going
Usually this involved me being strapped down, sedated, talked about how i wasnt there, being called the R slur compared to a toddler or a sick dog that should be put down 

When their fun was over they may do the other stuff like temp and blood pressure as well
Usually ive be given some diuretic or laxative combo and be forced  to stay there until i went, usually ide also be cathed and sometimes enemaed an additional time to make sure i was ""cleaned out"" then ide be given a pull up or a cheap medical diaper, be made to put it on and then given clothes and be allowed to walk to school or back to my cabin, this could take hours sometimes so it took up a lot of my day

This was basically everyday of my life while at Acadia

However Ms."

>The most common early signs of a Suboxone overdose are:

>Constricted pupils

>**Drowsiness**

>**Confusion**

>**Lightheadedness**

>Impaired vision

>Slurred speech

>Poor coordination

>**Discolored lips, skin, and nails**

>Seizures

>**Nausea**

>**Vomiting**

>Difficulty breathing

>Impaired memory

>**Stomach ache**

>**Mood fluctuations**

>Anxiety

>Irritability

>**Loss of consciousness**

>If you or someone you love is displaying any of these signs and symptoms, seek medical help immediately. If left untreated, a **Suboxone overdose may result in death.**

I was in West ridge academy in West Jordan I was there from late 2020-2022 and it was literally hell I was treated like shit and it was the worst experience of my life everything that happens still bothers me to this day

When I first got there I was supposed to go to the high-school side but instead they put me on the younger kid side and told my mom it was due to safety reason but later I got told that they needed a “older role model and someone to help take care and parent the kids in the home” I was put under so much pressure and constantly got in trouble for taking care of people I was controlled and constantly got put in isolation over the small things

Multiple times when I was in there they withheld my meds and multiple times they threw them on the floor and made me find them like I was a dog and every time I refused I got put in isolation sometimes for days on end 

When I went in there I was vegetarian and I hadn’t touched meat in 5 years but the second I was in there they made me eat meat and any time I complained I would again be put in isolation they put me on food watch and stood over my shoulder while I ate I shit you not the best food there was the moldy bread the food was so bad 

Every time there was any conflict in the house I would be takin in for questioning and they took my home visits even if I had no association with the conflict because “ i am supposed to be helping the home” and they threatened to send me to the high school side every time there was small issue they would threaten to transfer me multiple times they brought up sending me to wilderness because I was causing issues when I just put my head down

The staff would watch me while I showered and while I got changed they would make constant sexual comments about me and my body and multiple times they tried to do things the teacher grabbed my ass and my boobs and when I told my therapist they told me I was over reacting and that I was lying so they took away my home visits and tried to get me into wilderness 

I was sexually assaulted multiple times in there and every time it was brushed off as if I was the problem 

Multiple times staf would touch my scars and I have been told by many different staff how to do it “better” it was super hard on me to hear that all the time 

Any time I would tell my mom anything I would get in trouble because I shouldn’t be telling her things that were going on because it wasn’t her business

I was in and out of WRA quite a few times and sometimes I still want to go back even tho it was the worst time of my life sometimes I still miss the schedule and the abuse that came from it

Going into the real world after WRA was Hard and I didn’t gain any real life skills I was isolated in there and had very little control over my life that when I got out I didn’t know what to do after my time at west ridge I was in and out of high risks and had multiple suicide attempts I was sent to another treatment program and I am still not the same person I was before treatment going back to school was hard having control of when I went to bed or brushed my teeth or even when I could go to the bathroom was so foreign to me at that point any time I would do anything I was so worried I was going to get in trouble 

I still sleep on my journal 
I still have a hard time socializing and I have so much more social anxiety then I had before I went in there

My advice to people in treatment is it gets better you will get out and it won’t be like this forever 

My advice to parents don’t send your kids to res it is so hard on them and it causes more issues then it resolves 

I feel like it is important for us survivors to share our stories to not only speak out but to show people they aren’t alone

troubledteens,behavioral_health,blackout,I survived living almost 4 years in a youth institution for “troubled teens”,"The physical abuse I faced:
If I didn’t do what they asked me to do the second they asked me to do it they would grab me, pull me with them and I would be forced to sit next to the dinner table until fit was time to go to our rooms, then when I went into my room they would lock the door behind me, and they wouldn’t unlock it before they decided that they wanted to “deal with us”
If I ever tried to express any form of negative feelings, I would be held down and be restrained until I either passed out or had cried and screamed so much that my voice was raw and I was too tired to fight them off anymore…. The couple that ran the place would never do anything to better the situation… you could go to them, arguments ready and they would have no reason to say no because they would either profit off of it, or it would make the teens living there happier, but they always refused… no matter what it was, it could be getting a pet to better your mental health or something as simple as getting blackout curtains to be able to sleep better, but they always refused…

Verbal abuse wasn’t uncommon either, I remember so vividly when one employee shouted at me from the other side of the parking lot (atleast 40-50 feet away from me) “it’s fucking fantastic that you live here, because you’re a fucking bitch with some fucking huge problems, it wouldn’t surprise me if you end up as a murderer”… he shouted that at me, I was 16 when that happened…
Some teens that were “picture perfect” had almost no rules, would be driven where they wanted to, would get to eat and sleep as much as they wanted too, and were almost given total freedom… I sadly wasn’t one of them… I would get a set portion size and if I asked for more they guilt tripped me and verbally abused me even more than before… and they decided when the “bad” teens would be locked inside of our rooms and when they would unlock the door to wake us up by shaking us violently…

There is still so much more but I sadly don’t have the energy to write anymore right now, but I will write more later!"

troubledteens,mental_health,trauma,Troubled Teen Industry: Commodifying Disability and Capitalizing on Fear,"Troubled Teen Industry: Commodifying Disability and Capitalizing on Fear Abstract: 

The “Troubled Teen” behavior reform industry is comprised of financially interconnected wilderness programs, residential treatment centers, and reform schools that incarcerate thousands of minors each year by marketing a supposed cure to non-normativity, and monetizing the discrimination and abuse of children with a myriad of disabilities, including mental illness, substance abuse and dependence, eating disorders, cognitive difference, or who simply exhibit subjectively “negative”- in the parents’ eyes-traits or habits, such as LGBT status or genuinely problematic behaviors that make them difficult to parent. This thesis aims to use trauma and disability theory, analysis of aesthetic representations of incarcerated “troubled teens,” and objective research to delimit and critique this corporate industry by exposing tits market pitch and corporate culture, the deforming principles on which it functions, and the deliberate treatment model in place that characteristically abuses the people, both parents and children, to whom it caters, tracing the roots of this industry back to American Eugenics, and exposing the obfuscated system of privatized incarceration that has stolen the wellbeing and even the lives of the most vulnerable minors."

                                 The treatment
First off I’m going to talk about the treatment so I think that we were unfairly treated and some kids were treated better under the same situations and others a example is I’m not going to name anyone but a peer of mine was pushing someone, usually this would result in a consequence called out of community meaning you’re just isolated from everyone but I’ll get to that later and he was never punished for it and this happens all of the time, I think that this was mostly related to the staff and just how much they want to do their job now I’ll talk about stuff later but the treatment of the kids was very low and no one really cared except for some certain people

                                    Food/hygiene 
OK for this part I would always and probably a few times a week find hair in my meals and we didn’t really get fed that much and example is we would get breakfast on the weekdays at eight. And on the weekends we would get breakfast at nine and then we would have lunch at 12 on the weekdaysAnd then on the weekends lunch at one and both on the weekend and weekdays we would get dinner at 5:30 so the food wasn’t usually that good and there wasn’t any other options for kids that were picky you are allergies they would just give you worse stuff."

* Children, teenagers and young adults sent away by their parents to institutes (""training centres"") to learn and gain skills, and/or as punishment
* Parents 'not knowing how intense it is'
* Punishment by isolation (in the 'prayer room', an empty room with just a bible in) for up to weeks at a time
* Extreme control (a team leader raising three fingers means everyone has to smile, having a less than an inch heel on a shoe is a massive crime)
* Control of belongings (one woman had tampons taken from her when her belongings were searched)
* Sessions where they'd 'grill' you over what you did wrong and they'd make you confess over and over, with shame being a key teaching tool
* Windows sealed shut to prevent suicide attempts
* ""Brainwashing"" via tapes, speeches, seminars etc. Shiny Happy People on Amazon Video - TTI in Episode 3 I'm currently watching the new docuseries Shiny Happy People on Amazon Video, which is about the Duggars (19 Kids and Counting), the IBLP, and Bill Gothard."
