combined and a a bathroom its called monolocale it was really small so small that two people can t live together comfortably we were 5 living there lol he was renting it from the government they have them low cost for people that don t make a lot of money and since he didn t pay and he also brought 5 ppl when that house was supposed to only have one person there they decided to kick us i remember them coming and kicking us out when my dad was convinced they will have empathy for us cuz we were kids lol anyways we got kicked out the house and had to live in a fucking a truck my dad had we slept in mattresses in the back of the truck in a parking lot we used to pee in a bucket and have water in other buckets to wash our faces teeth before sleeping or when waking up we used to go to the mcdonalds everyday to eat breakfast and maybe use the bathroom there we ate pizza everyday this lasted almost 9 months of being homeless and going to school in a country we just step our feet in when we were COMPLETELY FINE IN OUR HOME COUNTRY lol those 9 months weren t all in the truck we also lived like 3 months with our uncle who has an italian wife and a 8 yo kid at the time their house wasnt big but enough only for them tho even tho my sister was with them from the begging cuz the truck doesnt fit 5 ppl lmao we also stayed at this family that is from our home town and parents are friends of my parents so we were literally disturbing every body lol we weren t able to find a house since my mom doesnt work and my dad works on his own not in a company and people here when they rent their homes they usually try to not rent them to immigrants since some of them dont pay and we have a bad image lol the next summer of 2018 we didnt have a house either so my mom and siblings went back to our home country to visit and stay there the summer while i stayed with my dad at this family s house only the dad and his brother were in the house tho i passed those 3 months of summer completely alone in the house i dont even go out only to buy some food my dad works all day and same with the other men that were with us i was 14 and completely isolated in the house lol i wake up stay on the phone cook white pasta and sleep this was my routine for 3 whole months i lost all of my social skills and confidence i didn t talk to my old friends in my home country cuz i was scared that they might ask me what im doing or how im living and i didn t want to embarrass my self and tell them that i was homeless for 9 months thats why i didn t call or answer their calls I didnt even learn any italian since i wasnt speaking it lol and btw we this is no the second italian town we live in so we weren t even stable we were from a place to place so it was impossible to know people and make friends when u not even part of society The next year i was in my first high school year it was 2019 it was already the 8 9th month of being homeless lol we finally got a house in another town this town is so small it has like 4k person living there nothing to do i made some friends in my first high school year but they weren t really friends i was acting like a clown trying to make them laugh hoping they become my friends but at least i wasn t completely alone and they were talking to me and joking with me and i enjoyed having them as classmates lowkey but then i lose that year due to me not being serious and i had to redo it i changed class and after that never heard from them again i also made some friends in my new year but again never heard of them when the year finish but hey at least i was trying and i was actually learning the language and talk to ppl but then covid hits lock down i change school and go to another town for school school is in another town but i was still in the same small town living covid lock down made me lose ALL the progress that i made i lost all my social skills and i forgot my Italian and imagine changing school and having ur first year of ur new school online thru a pc i made 0 friends in that year it was like my first year in italy just quiet all the time with my mask on i lost all my social skills and developed social anxiety my life was go school then home then school then home and i used to speak only in my house outside the house i had no one to speak to i studied with the same classmates for 4 years and only started becoming normal again and actually have what is close to a conversation in italian only during the end of the 3rd year and 4th year and it was because i went to my home country after 6 years of not going and reconnecting with my cousins and 2 old friends that remember me cuz obviously if u dont show ur existence in 6 years ppl will get over u so now i dont even have friends even in my home country lol this 1 month vacation kinda healed my social skills a bit tho but still had no friends it was only in 2023 24 that i made 3 friends i knew at the gym and it was only last year that i stared going out with them on weekends but i still feel like i dont have friends it still feel as if im alone literally since i was 13 till 19 20 for 6 7 years of my teen years never have i had fun or had any friend or did anything remarkable and i can remember and be proud of 7 years of being alone completely alone go from school to home and from home to school 7 years of my best years wasted i am now a boring person with no personality even tho im healing and even tho if u talk to me we will have a normal conversation and you would NEVER guess that i have no friends people already have their friend groups and i am an outsider who was always quiet and weird so i dont think ill ever be to have a normal social life i talk with people at the gym and we are friends and go out sometimes i made some friends at work and we went to eat i talk to almost everyone at work yet i have no friends and no deep connections all feel like superficial connections it was not my choice im not actually weird or anything i just didnt find stability to express my self imagine if when i came here i had a house and lived a normal life imagine if my dad signed me into to play sport or anything to get into the community my life wouldve been so different Same with my siblings in all of these 7 years they lived from school to home and from home to school they never go hang with other people or have any friends i never saw my sister go out during weekends or during evenings our lifes are so depressing and im sure they hate their lifes too its like as if we dont deserve to exist its like everything is against us i feel so sorry for them my brother is a fun guy but he found himself in this situation and he was completely alone too he is still alone i hate myself for making these 2 friends at the gym cuz they be calling me sometimes to play video games and i dont want to talk to them in front of my siblings to avoid remembering them i feel so sorry for my sister she found her self in the streets and was also alone for these 7 years and is still alone i wish our lives were normal and we never came to our dad this is really so depressing Thanks for reading idk if its me that is weird and bad at social interactions and making excuses for not being able to make friends and build a social life even tho i was in italy for 8 years or is it really not my fault if u have any questions ask me Me and my 2 siblings have literally no friends and had no friends for over 7 years anyone else",

    "input": "at this point we ve been just talking for about a week then she finally hits me with the question do you hate me for what i did i told her no that i could never hate her obviously i hate what she did but i could never hate her i told her how i felt like i was being played the whole time then we were really getting into it i explained all of the emotions i was feeling she explained her side of the story she basically said how she was in a really rough spot how she didn t know what she wanted like and how she was scared to get into a relationship with me so that s why she left back in february bc she felt like she wasn t ready didn t know what she really wanted at the time how after she stopped talking to me her friend put her on this guy that wanted to hook up w her so she did but she made it clear she didn t stop talking to me to hook up with this guy it was something that happened after the fact only happened one time said that she didn t want him there was no real emotion to it that it was a mistake she mentioned as well that the reason her mom didn t let her go out was because of how upset she was at her because after she hooked up with the guy she had to ask her mom to buy her plan b she came back to me because she said she felt like i was what she wanted how she explained how she wanted a relationship with me but wasn t exactly ready for one because mainly she had never been in a relationship before how sorry she was that she kept me around like that never intended to hurt me and just how she was back then she was so confused never knew what she was doing she took full accountability of how she went about things the wrong way i understood where she came because she had had some severe trauma with her father s abuse towards her was mentally not in the right place was really struggling so i forgave her we started talking for about another 2 months immediately off the bat i could tell she really changed as a person how she seemed so much happier healthier how good things were in august of 2023 we finally officially got together as boyfriend girlfriend things were honestly going so great between us i completely got over the past she treats me so well now i really love her i couldn t ask for anything more but then there was an issue later in august 2023 but this time she wasn t the problem you see for some backstory my mother was a heroin addict she deeply traumatized me practically my entire childhood she was physically verbally abusive towards me mainly because of the drugs severe case of untreated bipolar disorder she had started using back in 2010 shortly after my sister was born she would steal my fathers rent money causing us to get evicted constantly moving from house to house whatnot as i grew older i grown to slowly resent her i hated her for what she had done to me the rest of my family she broke us apart caused her my father to split in june of 2019 my father had no choice but to move us to where we lived it was just me my younger brother sister and my father it really took a toll on my father after everything because he really tried to be a good father to us despite everything that had happened he really tried to help my mother with her addiction right before they split my mother went to rehab for 6 months when she got out she started using again in the same week that s when he said enough was enough and moved us here but when i say it took a toll on him i mean it REALLY took a toll on his mental he had started heavily drinking smoking after that in november of 2020 he lost his mind he started talking nonsense saying there was angels in the sky following him that the government was coming to take him and how he was the reincarnation of jesus christ he was very scary i had never seen him act like that in my life my family eventually had to make the decision to send him to a mental facility but the problem was is that when they were transporting him via ambulance they didn t have him strapped down so my father jumped out of the ambulance broke his leg his hip ran into the woods the paramedics caught up with him instead of taking him to the mental facility where they were supposed to they took him to the hospital to get broken limbs fixed but after that he got sent straight back home about 2 weeks later so he never actually got the mental help he needed but when he came home he acted completely normal to the rest of our family they knew he was acting strange but never enough to cause great concern apparently he would put on a facade around them but around us he was insane saying how he was the reincarnation of jesus christ all this other bs he was the exact same my family didnt take action until one night he made us all come out of our rooms to watch some movie he told all of us to put our phones on the dinner table for some reason me my siblings complied bc we were afraid about half way into awkwardly watching this movie he takes all of our phones including his fries them in the microwave we all start freaking out he starts getting REALLY scary saying all these horrible things to me i don t rlly want to get into but i was genuinely traumatized frightened",
