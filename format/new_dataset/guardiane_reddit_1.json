bathroom I took her to a doctor the next day and we have been on this journey ever since and it just seems to be getting worse especially this year she has been to so many different doctors and therapists and different meds and nothing seems to be helping this last year has completely broken me both both mentally and physically a year ago In January I left a abusive 3 year marriage and she has been making the whole healing process impossible because I have put everything I ve been struggling with on hold to help her I ve lost a insane amount of weight due to stress and working nonstop while trying to figure out a way to help her I feel like I have checked out of life and that I would rather die then spend one more day in this hell she has been in and out of a psychiatric hospital 4 times in a 6 month period for trying to overdose on anything she can find and cutting herself she s experimenting with drugs and alcohol and she s said that she has been raped 4 times in a one month period and as much as I want to believe she is telling the truth some things don t add up and she will not tell police who all has done it or anything about it she told me that she was pregnant and had a miscarriage well after the miscarriage happened she is physically violent at times has destroyed my property and attacked me leaving very large bruises I ve had to physically restraint her each time she s stolen anything and everything she can get her hands on no matter what it is so I ve completely locked everything up in my room and when I get a package in the mail she steals that I ve had to make a PO box to keep everything out of her reach and I am getting to a point where I am so completely burnt out and resentful and I am doing it all on my own with very little support because nobody can handle her even on her good moments and I just want to give up and drive my car off a cliff and have someone else handle everything because I can t take anymore I ve been on empty for so long and it has been so hard to even see a therapist it took 9 months to get in and see somebody for myself and it feels like every time I have a appointment she has some sort of behavior or theres some crisis and she blows up my phone i don t even want to go into the daily battle to get her to school and just make it the rest of the school year without getting kicked out I have had to work graveyard hours to be home during the day and be able to get her to doctor appointment and counseling and whatever else that needs to be done but that means I also don t sleep much and that doesn t help me either I guess I just need to vent I feel guilty every time I feel so much resentment and nobody understands everything I ve been going through and I am too afraid to say the things I feel to anyone because they are terrible and I feel like no parent should ever feel this way about their kid but I feel so broken down and people always say it will get better but in the last 9 10 years it s gotten worse by the day and I have lost any hope of it ever getting better I feel like I have sacrificed my entire youth and myself for people and they abuse me in return for it I feel like my life has been wasted and I don t want to keep doing this I need it to end I think about killing myself daily and I know I need help but I am at a loss of what else to do My kid has broken me Sorry long

was living with me when I was younger I would bring a pillow and a blanket to sleep on the floor with her and I would cuddle up to her because I felt bad that she was sleeping on the floor and I didn t want to be away from her I have spent whole Summers with her watching MASH and watching Young and the Restless and fire country her favorite shows and we would always go have girls days I would paint her nails and mine and put on face mask we would always go to the Dollar Store and get snacks and we would always talk about how hot Johnny Depp is and was when he was younger and now and we were talking about my boyfriend s overtime she would laugh at my jokes and I m a quiet kid and she s one of the few people I talk to she is one of the few people I love most in this world and I remember how slow she drives listening to church music and how she eats ice after the Pepsi s gone and I would tell her everything even the bad things that were going on in my house when I was younger and couldn t do anything about it and she would listen to me because no one ever really would so it was important for her and me for her to go with me prom shopping for a dress we found a beautiful red dress and she carries her oxygen tank with her because she s on dialysis so I so I was trying on dresses the whole time and she would tell me how pretty I would looked and looked and we went to go eat dinner and I thought everything was fine but 4 days later which is today my mom sits me down and tells me that my mimi has cancer for the fifth time and is no longer taking her dialysis treatment because there s no way that she ll come back from this and the doctor says she has 30 days to live and my mimi who is tough as nails has been through hell and back so I never thought she would die I figured that she would even be in my future wedding so me realizing that that prom dress that we picked out together is going to be the last dress she sees me in and might be the last time she sees me ever because she s in the hospital and doesn t want any of her grandkids including me to see her like that in the hospital as soon as I heard the news I turned numb and I was both sad devastated shocked and mad I didn t want to be mad but somehow I was mad at both myself and her for her not telling me that she was in pain and was dying when we were prom shopping cuz I would have stopped everything just to spend more time with her and she knew that I would and my mom told me that she was scared so I texted her it s going to be okay and then I love her and she replied I love you too baby and yes it is and I feel helpless and I don t know how to cope I lost a grandmother this year already from my dad s side of the family but it wasn t half as bad because she had dementia and couldn t remember who I was and I haven t seen her in a long time but it still hurt this one is twice as worse to where I can t breathe I m losing a best friend not just my grandmother so how do I cope in a healthy way and I know it s in God s hands and she s knowing the Lord for all her life so she s going in a better place but still is it selfish that I want her to live to see me do stuff

    "input": "Tldr This is a very long thesis on my theory that the majority of street guys are undiagnosed neurodivergents who wouldn t have gone down that path if trauma didn t cause they re symptoms to manifest in certain ways as it was more socially acceptable I will also explore how someone that used to be so innocent can do evil things n I ll show how the reason they joined is mostly always the downfall of them aswell what compelled me I know it all too well I went youth offending for 3 months that same year I was kicked out of 3 schools then I got diagnosed with being neurodivergent in youth offending it s ironic how my place of punishment gave me the most support I ve ever had whereas schools just punished me and pushed me down the pipeline I m very lucky to escape and now I m studying mechanical engineering it s been a thought l ve had that this is the most common reason people join gangs street activities Long explanation of my theory Most street guys either have autism or adhd undiagnosed in which the shaming negligence of theyre emotions invalidation and abuse because of they re underlying symptoms of mental health early on causes them to manifest in a different ways due to continuous post trauma causing the symptoms to form in a more socially acceptable way as a defence mechanisms for theyre environment where most undiagnosed neurodivergents end up the streets not knowing they re also now bordelines or suffer from cptsd because the symptoms are so glorified you won t even see it as a problem until your in a healthier environment but still reacting like it s still life or death for you and thinking they re heart turn cold your just numbing yourself so you don t have to cope with the emotional side of yourself that may not be suitable for this environment and that s why you feel empty and shallow as you ve lost your sense of self to protect your physical self with a sprinkle of random dissociation Most of the trauma starts at home where you wouldn t know when your parents would get pissed at you or for what you did and how miniscule it would be and the punishment you would get for that however you would know they do go 0 100 very quickly things like that in our environment are seen as normal but that s because there not aware of mental health symptoms such as emotional dysregulation but when you do things like raise your voice to defend yourself you might be getting hit and then being called a bad kid that is disrespectful to theyre parents for raising they re voice even if it s more out of fear and being anxious than anger you d take getting shouted at even if it wasn t worth the verbal abuse you got as something being wrong with you in a shameful way such as being a bad kid who doesn t respect he s parents This has adverse effects on the kid as he s only learnt to communicate he s problems aggressively otherwise it would get dismissed which would cause potential unnecessary fights adding to getting in trouble in schools for not focusing in class so he s already getting told negative things about himself externally before he gets to find out who he is himself this already sets him up for failure for when he builds he s sense of self with almost creating a self fulfilling prophecy with teachers punishing you rather than giving you support they will give you a detention for getting heavily distracted distracting others on a report card instead of getting help to find out why is this something that s happening regardless of consequences especially when you can see the kid making an effort However if no one is appreciating your effort this will cause you to give up you ll jus start externalising that Shame into more anger and get into more fights get put into naughty schools however it maybe you will start chilling wit the wrong crowd who will also have similar stories to yours in similar environments and upbringing in which you will all influence each other some of you might be autistic some might be adhd some of you may be comorbid with also ptsd in the form of cptsd or comorbid with bpd but I d hazard a guess that most pupils who are regularly kicked out of school are not neurotypical with minimally childhood trauma hence why You trauma bond and start doing bad things together as there s a lot of overlap on alot of the symptoms of these conditions in which you won t have to be aware of the symptoms itself to know your similar to someone else that has it such as impulse or thrill seeking for lack of dopamine with adhd or relating to feeling empty after a situation like getting stabbed or being both added onto the fact that the thrill of doing something wrong and getting away with it such as stealing cars robbing shops that Is because you finally doing something naughty by your own choice and the risk of getting caught was the thrill some of these things some wouldn t have dared done before a certain age but they are trying to feel connected to a world they learnt to numb due to a neglect of their needs and emotions however this would be the classed as the Honeymoon phase of a group forming where people would build a new persona in which stuff like being a hothead is glorified but having a freeze or flight reaction to the same situation is stigmatised in which these kids don t know that it s just they re symptoms of mental health manifesting in a different way as a defence mechanism for survival however whenever it s guys with similar symptoms of each other because of similar situations and lack of support certain traits are more desirable than others such as your capacity for violence over good inter personal skills as through confirmation bias of situations one has come in more handy than the other therefore when a malleable kid who s attempt of interpersonal skills got him neglected and exploited whereas the more violent he would learn to be the more respect he got in an environment he felt like finally related too he wouldn t care which one is right or wrong by the societal standards structure that was the same structure that kept labelling him bad and told him who he was as a person instead of why he was that person and instead of support punished him for symptoms he was tryna control n still got neglected for it regardless of the effort embracing those symptoms around similar people who have had the same unique experiences as you feels liberating and new",

    "input": "Cloak and dagger really go behind my back spreading shit lies etc so on making many people dislike me and successful in doing so and even when he basically stepped back from doing all that people for years continued doing it my 1st childhood crush he convinced to hate me and generally just isolated me and i want to make clear now that this school was very small so literally everyone knew the shit he was spitting which to this day i know no details of really but it still had a massive impact on me Around this era of my life i started to get into social media insta kik skype yea remember those well insta is still infact more relevant now even the very early days of amino back when it was all individual apps i tried making friends on pokemon amino back in the day but i lacked very little success Partiually due to toxic people on there another part into how socially inept i was and a heavy majority around to my emotionally instability which has prosisted as a problem for serveal years and worsened in many ways the only positive i can really say is i m somewhat more self aware and can hold some self control at times but weirdly my ability to hold things in more only makes my blowups when they do happen much worse You think being introduced to social media would a net positive for these feelings of loneliness right but it was the complete opposite it only amplified them dramatically seeing how everyone else got along with people and i didn t getting into secondary school was already bad enough as people meeting up outside was becoming more and more of a common thing naturally with people getting to that age but i was never exposed to such opportunities Here i was still dreaming about getting a full coach of people to play some new super mario bros wii and mario kart and that never really happened as me being introduced to xbox live in the late 360 days i think that eventually transitioned into having a gaming group online by the xbone days but that is another dream i had tempering issues with So where are we now anyways I m kinda getting lost in all these sidetracks my slow decend further and further into depression But now let s go into the golden age which i referred to it as at the time but looking back that was really delusional of me This is when i finally built a gaming group of sorts you had your gaming swed wolver that i almost saw as a little brother or sorts knight which i saw as the every man as my equel as someone i could even convide in somewhat with my mental struggles and zombies the narristic ego maniac who admitely brought stuff to the table that none of us had knowledge of really You make ask what happened with these 3 well after the 2 years of solid friendship things started going on and off constantly zombies eventually started getting pissy with me and ended up blocking all of us knight got a girlfriend and changed into a completely different person and as for wolver well he refused to basically play anything that wasn t cod zombies or forza But around this time i also had a friend that had nothing to do with gaming she became my emotion clutch of sorts named kimchi i loved this girl but given everything that had happened in my life at that point but struggling to come to terms with it all my unsettling home life crippingly loneliness my emotions the bullying alot of this shit i just didn t understand at the time but it made me sad depressed and stressed all the same so i d express how i m feeling but no matter what she really said given she couldn t comfort or resolve me on said issues things naturally got worse I can barely look back at the messages i sent her i even stop and think if i had really sent them they just all look awful and i genuinely don t forgive myself for what said especially for how much she meant and probably still does to me When she inevitably left and understandably happened around the same time or well rather after the group fell apart so i was left with nothing I ended up joining another support amino where i would meet significant people 2 named beth and jess beth was a bitch and jess was probably the person i shouldve talked to more and given more attention to given we wrre in the same boat but given how i was at the time they basically just demonised me despite having regret for the stuff i was doing cause i did and even wanting to adjust that shit i was just shit out and branded as a monster Not even a whole you need help just that i was a lost cause and not worth saving when i myself was suffering at the time but this is also around the time i met a friend called blue who would go on to be my best friend for many years but even we would have a shakey relationship over the years Other than the diffculty with the afformention 2 people i also had this person acusing me of being over 20 due to my looks i was 15 16 at the time maybe even 14 all this blurs together but having them acuse me of lying about my age and etc definitely had a major impact on me which brings me back to my kik days once more briefly I remember having my face as my pfp on there back in the day but even from the age of 12 i had subble on my chin so looking back at the time to some i probably looked like i was in my late teens but people would often make fun and insult me for my appearance and at a very early age just gave me the impression of being ugly which i still have to this day its a simliar reason why i dont like sharing or showing my face online because so often i ve been treated differently after the fact like this person refusing to talk to me This created a whole other drama that eventually forced me to be removed from a community i felt welcomed by once again and even caused a rift between me and a friend at the time that i deeply regret you see she was the leader at the time anf fairly or not defended me to the death but it came to a point where she got overruled and did what had to be done At the time i sorta felt betrayed and she stood by it wether she actually did or not or wether it was even right or not i cant say to this day the only regret i do have which i imagine she related with was that we let that get in the way of our friendship ultimately ending that of all the people i would like to apologise to she was one of them but unfortunately haven t managed to reach them to do so Coming back to the real world again i finally got out of that horrible school but it was a situation of out of the pan and into the fire as the collage i went too was argueably worse Harrassment of teachers and students and no one really wanting to take any accountability lessons were either piss easy or too difficult and was getting no help in those instances call it goldielocks but it was true Then Covid happened which you think would make things worse but ironically it probably did me more good in a way because i was living covid my whole life locked in doors on my one with no one to talk to or anywhere to go for once people were sorta in my shoes not that i m glad any of that shit happened god no and i wouldn t say there was any real long term benefits to it for me either but yea Second year of collage comes around and i get to a point i cant take it anymore and refuse to come back then social services come into the scene and why i am only mentioning these pricks now seizes to amaze me being on the spectrum i ve had these guys helping me for years but in reality they take 2 3 business years to do as minimum as possible they convinced me to deroll from collage with the promise they would get me elsewhere which guess what that never happend And here i am now 3 4 years later without getting back into any sort of education or work and my mental health only got worse from there i finally got a place of my own which wasn t really mind it was just an empty place my dad got cause reasons and after bs at home i moved into there and never looked back And i had been through many friendships online mostly short term some few long term ones me and blue went seperate ways once which broke me but we eventually got back on talking terms over a year or 2 later after i felt i had improved i had not which resulted in a far worse breakdown 2 years later that sent me into a horrible spiral that sorta brings me to now She left me 17th of December 2023 a date that rings in my mind to this day and for about 6 7 months i desperately tried to geg her back looking at everything i did wrong and everything i could of done and do differently and i took online therapy and everything i had every genuine effort of making things right but for better or worse she had replaced me Around march i joined a suicide forum more learning towards ending my life at that point as her return seemed less and less likely and with everything else going the way it was no education no job no friends no real family outside of the core you could see why i was leading down this natural path And i got closer and closer to thag eventually meant some people along the way one kf which would be a bitch that maniplated the whole site and made me out to be this monster i never was which got me outsted from there too feeling a common tread here i m aware But around june things did change for me and not just because of the start of the euros but a person i met that went on to be my partner but simliar story given the amount of trauma i had dealt with in the past 6 7 months yet alone serveal years i felt myself having to fill my life and sole with postives and good people Given i was surrounded for ages wirh people that hated and despised me surrounding myself wkrh people that liked and loved me were only natural unfortunately in achieving this there were far to many setbacks even alot of which let in more undesirable people i had to recover from making an endless cycle Also during this stage of recovery i tried to get back on this group i was on previously to see my friend irl again which is another story i didn t explain for a few years i was on this grouo where i basically didn t jeal with anyone despite being told i eventually would i never did even some of the staff were toxic toward me the only people i had positive relationships with were well the people i already knew and had a positive relationship with but when me and my buddy fell out i saw no reason to go anymore and withdrew from the service that i ve almost since spent a year trying to get back onto I also wanna clarify up to 17 my only real interest was gaming i always loved music but never came into tune with it later tried anime and loved it got into football with the 2018 world cup and so on i only really diversified later on especially given my shutin anit social despite being an extrovert or least ambriovert life style The gaming group i once again tried to stich together that i was holding together by a thread crumbed and collapsed apart and on top of that the what was my parent and best friend basically wanted nothing to do with me either so it basically left me back where i was back where i am now Still traumatised by the lose of that friend coming up to 2 years ago more isolated than i ve ever been academically behind where i should be socially awkward and inadept emotionally unstable and volatile I don t really have a place in this world anymore or so it feels and i hope by writing my story you can somewhat see why",

    "input": "How being undiagnosed neurodivergent can lead to depression and trauma and prison thesis theory Tldr This is a very long thesis on my theory that the majority of street guys are undiagnosed neurodivergents who wouldn t have gone down that path if trauma didn t cause they re symptoms to manifest in certain ways as it was more socially acceptable I will also explore how someone that used to be so innocent can do evil things n I ll show how the reason they joined is mostly always the downfall of them aswell what compelled me I know it all too well I went youth offending for 3 months that same year I was kicked out of 3 schools then I got diagnosed with being neurodivergent in youth offending it s ironic how my place of punishment gave me the most support I ve ever had whereas schools just punished me and pushed me down the pipeline I m very lucky to escape and now I m studying mechanical engineering it s been a thought l ve had that this is the most common reason people join gangs street activities Long explanation of my theory Most street guys either have autism or adhd undiagnosed in which the shaming negligence of theyre emotions invalidation and abuse because of they re underlying symptoms of mental health early on causes them to manifest in a different ways due to continuous post trauma causing the symptoms to form in a more socially acceptable way as a defence mechanisms for theyre environment where most undiagnosed neurodivergents end up the streets not knowing they re also now bordelines or suffer from cptsd because the symptoms are so glorified you won t even see it as a problem until your in a healthier environment but still reacting like it s still life or death for you and thinking they re heart turn cold your just numbing yourself so you don t have to cope with the emotional side of yourself that may not be suitable for this environment and that s why you feel empty and shallow as you ve lost your sense of self to protect your physical self with a sprinkle of random dissociation Most of the trauma starts at home where you wouldn t know when your parents would get pissed at you or for what you did and how miniscule it would be and the punishment you would get for that however you would know they do go 0 100 very quickly things like that in our environment are seen as normal but that s because there not aware of mental health symptoms such as emotional dysregulation but when you do things like raise your voice to defend yourself you might be getting hit and then being called a bad kid that is disrespectful to theyre parents for raising they re voice even if it s more out of fear and being anxious than anger you d take getting shouted at even if it wasn t worth the verbal abuse you got as something being wrong with you in a shameful way such as being a bad kid who doesn t respect he s parents This has adverse effects on the kid as he s only learnt to communicate he s problems aggressively otherwise it would get dismissed which would cause potential unnecessary fights adding to getting in trouble in schools for not focusing in class so he s already getting told negative things about himself externally before he gets to find out who he is himself this already sets him up for failure for when he builds he s sense of self with almost creating a self fulfilling prophecy with teachers punishing you rather than giving you support they will give you a detention for getting heavily distracted distracting others on a report card instead of getting help to find out why is this something that s happening regardless of consequences especially when you can see the kid making an effort However if no one is appreciating your effort this will cause you to give up you ll jus start externalising that Shame into more anger and get into more fights get put into naughty schools however it maybe you will start chilling wit the wrong crowd who will also have similar stories to yours in similar environments and upbringing in which you will all influence each other some of you might be autistic some might be adhd some of you may be comorbid with also ptsd in the form of cptsd or comorbid with bpd but I d hazard a guess that most pupils who are regularly kicked out of school are not neurotypical with minimally childhood trauma hence why You trauma bond and start doing bad things together as there s a lot of overlap on alot of the symptoms of these conditions in which you won t have to be aware of the symptoms itself to know your similar to someone else that has it such as impulse or thrill seeking for lack of dopamine with adhd or relating to feeling empty after a situation like getting stabbed or being both added onto the fact that the thrill of doing something wrong and getting away with it such as stealing cars robbing shops that Is because you finally doing something naughty by your own choice and the risk of getting caught was the thrill some of these things some wouldn t have dared done before a certain age but they are trying to feel connected to a world they learnt to numb due to a neglect of their needs and emotions however this would be the classed as the Honeymoon phase of a group forming where people would build a new persona in which stuff like being a hothead is glorified but having a freeze or flight reaction to the same situation is stigmatised in which these kids don t know that it s just they re symptoms of mental health manifesting in a different way as a defence mechanism for survival however whenever it s guys with similar symptoms of each other because of similar situations and lack of support certain traits are more desirable than others such as your capacity for violence over good inter personal skills as through confirmation bias of situations one has come in more handy than the other therefore when a malleable kid who s attempt of interpersonal skills got him neglected and exploited whereas the more violent he would learn to be the more respect he got in an environment he felt like finally related too he wouldn t care which one is right or wrong by the societal standards structure that was the same structure that kept labelling him bad and told him who he was as a person instead of why he was that person and instead of support punished him for symptoms he was tryna control n still got neglected for it regardless of the effort embracing those symptoms around similar people who have had the same unique experiences as you feels liberating and new",

we became friends and they accepted me didn t made fun of me well not in a way that would hurt me but just as a light hearted jokes but one day family pressure got the best of me and i couldn t hold back my tear for too long so i called my friend that lived nearby and asked him to meet me immediately ignoring my family shouting and cursing and we meet but he was with his other friends as well i waited for them to leave trust me holding back those tears was really hard and i think i also scared his friends away because i was trying to hold back tears and wasn t blinking much just staring at them so they left and i asked how s it going and he replied fine what about you and then i just couldn t hold them back anymore i cried and he comforted me at first he was like TF but ya we talked i explained he tried to lighten up my mood and it actually helped a little and it took me 3 4 moths i suppose everyday was just hell my heart won t stop hurting and it felt like you know when you hold ice you get a little felling like needles were piercing your palm of our hand the same but in my heart it was hell every day i woke up i the thought why did i have to wake up today why didn t i just die ya after a few month one night i was felling that same pain it was too much and i also had home work of math but i didn t do it at night i was up till ig 4 5 i woke up in the morning around 8AM ig

i have social anxiety and every one was looking at me it made the pain worse and when the class got over the pain was missing but so were my emotions i was finally at peace i liked that feeling it was peace after a really long time i went completely numb like zero emotion i still knew when to express what emotion so no one noticed i have a pretty good ability to fake my emotions but i didn t feel those emotions it was just like wearing a mask no one noticed it had be around half a year year of me going numb and ya since last few week i feel my emotions slowly but surely returning but i don t like it the pain is sometimes back as well but i guess it will pass away i still listen to all those songs that helped me in that pain as a reminder to what i went through and to be grateful for what

as special or super smart just lucky I guess that I happen to skip a grade since I moved from a different country to the US I got here begging of 6th grade which should ve been my 5th grade but I got moved up for some reason anyways we all know the good old oh I had no clue what anyone was saying and I feel so out of place and I have no family but my parents and sibling s I learned english fairly quickly according to my teachers and then here comes end of 8th grade year I m so excited to go to high school and of course me and my friends were thinking about boys and of course here comes the cute white boy with blue eyes that happen to be the bad boy of the school and here I go chasing after him and then boom we happen to start dating keep in mind I m a year younger than all my classmates and this guy was pushing 15 while I was about 13 I just wanted to seem cool dating the bad boy of the class or whatever you wanna call it I got in tons of trouble that summer and I went from being the great older child who always listen and had the best grades to the trouble maker and horrible grades i went full 360 from who I was and then here comes the cute bad boy and tells me that in order to show him I truly loved him I had to have sex with him I come from a very conservative family and I was also freaking 13 almost 14 at the time I was scared but then again I wanted to fit in so I did it then things keep going downhill he breaks up not long after because he got what he wanted from me and I realized all the damaged I had done and that I couldn t go back and fix it my mom was thinking it would be better to move back to my home country but I threw and tantrum and stayed because I wanted to stay with the cute bad boy but now it s too late I feel like our lives are going downhill I hurt my brother my mom my other relatives in my home country and I just wanted to end it all halfway through my freshman year I tried to kill myself 3 times with no avail I got some counseling but we couldn t afford it but I thought I was feeling better I was told that I had anxiety and depression but I should be able to manage with no meds moving on to my sophomore year I meet this really nice guy who was a freshman but as I mentioned before I skipped a year so we where the same age we hit it off great and we started to become close friends and not long after we started dating I was his first girlfriend and my previous experience with my ex wasn t so great so we had no clue what we were supposed to do we take things slow and still acted as friends most of the times but we got more physical with a couple kisses here and there but it was great and I felt like I was the queen of the world my grades improved a lot my GPA went up a lot too and my home life improved too everything was great but he had no clue about who I was before we meet I was terrified and I thought he would totally break up after he found out but all he did was listen and hug me while I was sobbing and beating myself up about how terrible I was and how much of a piece of shit I am but he said that it s all in the past now and that no matter how broken I was he would be there to help me heal and he would never see me any different because he meet the new me and that s who he fell for not the old me he has been a great help and we have been dating for 2 years now he s been there for me when I had my anxiety attacks when I was having mental breakdowns he held me in his arms and told me it s okay to cry and I wasn t weak he has been there for me when I called him at 3 in the morning crying because I don t want to live anymore and told me that everything will be okay and we ll get through it and that he ll get up as many times as he has to to listen to me because I matter to him and my life matters and he sees potential in me that I can make a difference in this world and that to him in the most precious thing and he ll never give up Moving on to my junior year there wasn t much going on I felt happy and I made a lot of improvements and accomplished many things I was getting back into sports again and gained the libero position on the high school team I was also on of the team captains in my robotics team my boyfriend was part of it too I got a job and even got back into doing MMA and making many new friends and learning new skills this was the happiest I ever felt and I didn t cene suffer a single anxiety attack that year and all thanks to the support of my boyfriend and the new found self confidence and love he has been helping me build summer comes around and this is when Covid was happening we went on some dates but mainly going to each other s places and hangout with family it was great I feel genuinely loved and it s the first time I told myself that
