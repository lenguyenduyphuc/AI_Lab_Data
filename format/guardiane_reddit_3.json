    "input": "Any neurodivergent teenager have a review on my hypothesis Tldr This is a very long thesis on my theory that the majority of street guys are undiagnosed neurodivergents who wouldn t have gone down that path if trauma didn t cause they re symptoms to manifest in certain ways as it was more socially acceptable I will also explore how someone that used to be so innocent can do evil things n I ll show how the reason they joined is mostly always the downfall of them aswell what compelled me I know it all too well I went youth offending for 3 months that same year I was kicked out of 3 schools then I got diagnosed with being neurodivergent in youth offending it s ironic how my place of punishment gave me the most support I ve ever had whereas schools just punished me and pushed me down the pipeline I m very lucky to escape and now I m studying mechanical engineering it s been a thought l ve had that this is the most common reason people join gangs street activities Long explanation of my theory Most street guys either have autism or adhd undiagnosed in which the shaming negligence of theyre emotions invalidation and abuse because of they re underlying symptoms of mental health early on causes them to manifest in a different ways due to continuous post trauma causing the symptoms to form in a more socially acceptable way as a defence mechanisms for theyre environment where most undiagnosed neurodivergents end up the streets not knowing they re also now bordelines or suffer from cptsd because the symptoms are so glorified you won t even see it as a problem until your in a healthier environment but still reacting like it s still life or death for you and thinking they re heart turn cold your just numbing yourself so you don t have to cope with the emotional side of yourself that may not be suitable for this environment and that s why you feel empty and shallow as you ve lost your sense of self to protect your physical self with a sprinkle of random dissociation Most of the trauma starts at home where you wouldn t know when your parents would get pissed at you or for what you did and how miniscule it would be and the punishment you would get for that however you would know they do go 0 100 very quickly things like that in our environment are seen as normal but that s because there not aware of mental health symptoms such as emotional dysregulation but when you do things like raise your voice to defend yourself you might be getting hit and then being called a bad kid that is disrespectful to theyre parents for raising they re voice even if it s more out of fear and being anxious than anger you d take getting shouted at even if it wasn t worth the verbal abuse you got as something being wrong with you in a shameful way such as being a bad kid who doesn t respect he s parents This has adverse effects on the kid as he s only learnt to communicate he s problems aggressively otherwise it would get dismissed which would cause potential unnecessary fights adding to getting in trouble in schools for not focusing in class so he s already getting told negative things about himself externally before he gets to find out who he is himself this already sets him up for failure for when he builds he s sense of self with almost creating a self fulfilling prophecy with teachers punishing you rather than giving you support they will give you a detention for getting heavily distracted distracting others on a report card instead of getting help to find out why is this something that s happening regardless of consequences especially when you can see the kid making an effort However if no one is appreciating your effort this will cause you to give up you ll jus start externalising that Shame into more anger and get into more fights get put into naughty schools however it maybe you will start chilling wit the wrong crowd who will also have similar stories to yours in similar environments and upbringing in which you will all influence each other some of you might be autistic some might be adhd some of you may be comorbid with also ptsd in the form of cptsd or comorbid with bpd but I d hazard a guess that most pupils who are regularly kicked out of school are not neurotypical with minimally childhood trauma hence why You trauma bond and start doing bad things together as there s a lot of overlap on alot of the symptoms of these conditions in which you won t have to be aware of the symptoms itself to know your similar to someone else that has it such as impulse or thrill seeking for lack of dopamine with adhd or relating to feeling empty after a situation like getting stabbed or being both added onto the fact that the thrill of doing something wrong and getting away with it such as stealing cars robbing shops that Is because you finally doing something naughty by your own choice and the risk of getting caught was the thrill some of these things some wouldn t have dared done before a certain age but they are trying to feel connected to a world they learnt to numb due to a neglect of their needs and emotions however this would be the classed as the Honeymoon phase of a group forming where people would build a new persona in which stuff like being a hothead is glorified but having a freeze or flight reaction to the same situation is stigmatised in which these kids don t know that it s just they re symptoms of mental health manifesting in a different way as a defence mechanism for survival however whenever it s guys with similar symptoms of each other because of similar situations and lack of support certain traits are more desirable than others such as your capacity for violence over good inter personal skills as through confirmation bias of situations one has come in more handy than the other therefore when a malleable kid who s attempt of interpersonal skills got him neglected and exploited whereas the more violent he would learn to be the more respect he got in an environment he felt like finally related too he wouldn t care which one is right or wrong by the societal standards structure that was the same structure that kept labelling him bad and told him who he was as a person instead of why he was that person and instead of support punished him for symptoms he was tryna control n still got neglected for it regardless of the effort embracing those symptoms around similar people who have had the same unique experiences as you feels liberating and new",

alone I lived in the projects with my mother not being in my life and my father trying his best but was never around So I pushed through all of the horrors and managed to graduate high school even after not completing a single class in my junior year because I was in and out of a psych hospital for 4 months because of 3 suicide attempts I was given my old medical records a few months ago and apparently had taken an IQ test while I was inpatient and was never told my score apparently I was well into the genius level with a note from doctor that it would most likely be higher if I was in a less shattered state of mind I can t ever claim to have considered myself dumb and I have an unmeasured but obviously apparent EQ as well I am hyper analytical and perceptive of the world and the people in it to the point that I could read any person s emotional state just by their presence It made me incredibly introverted as I am an empath I would feel the pain of those around me and the pain of living in this fucked up world and it was too much to bare so I would hide myself away because I couldn t turn it off and I couldn t cope with it either I wanted to do something go in this world I wanted to be able to fight for those who grew up in even worse situations than me I wanted to help millions of people in even less developed countries because I knew the pain of never having help I tried to go to college like I was supposed to and would have had maximum financial aid but my grandfather passed away the year before I started and left my father money which was promptly stolen in a legal dispute from a greedy aunt yet it showed his income as much higher for that year I was told that I would receive no financial aid as a result so I reversed my decision to go but they promised my naïve self that they could fix it and it s a common thing that happens so I decided I would still go a month before I was supposed to begin they told me they couldn t fix it and I once again reversed my decision and shame on me but I fell for it again when they told me they could fix it As I needed to register for classes I signed up moved into a dorm and was told they couldn t do anything about it and I d need to take out private loans 28k in total for 1 year of college that I medically withdrew from after planned suicide attempt in my second semester I went inpatient again but because of the private loans stipulations if I was out of school for 6 months I would be required to pay them back because of the timing of when classes next started and when I went into the hospital that 6 months hit where I was out of school and the private loans placed a hold on my transcripts and restricted me from applying anywhere else and blocked my from registering for classes until I paid them off I did the only option I could and looked for work and because of my terrible emotional state I was rejected from even gas station jobs because my heart just wanted to be able to use my brain and not waste away behind a counter but I had no access no connections no financial help I eventually had one hiring manager at a retailer give me a chance and I rapidly climbed to an assistant manager role after 6 months having no prior experience because of my ability to handle so much I had fought all of my life so a busy and overloaded work day wasn t daunting it was just my norm I rode my success and with my ability to work with and understand people and what they wanted to hear I managed to work at Microsoft with no degree at only 21 and rode that throughout Covid I had finally started to make it I was making the most I ever had but my city is in the top 3 most expensive places to live in the US and I still struggled financially But I managed I worked two jobs to try and pay off the student loan debt faster while also completely supporting myself with no aid from family I continued to develop my skills and I continued fighting my way upwards in corporate with the dreams that someday I would make enough to have breathing room and finally escape the life of poverty But as soon as I starting making more the unpaid hospitals bills from 4 inpatient stays came back to haunt me 60k in debt with nothing to show for but being alive to pay off the debt So I fought for the last 7 years and I ve still been fighting I have 10k of debt left I make slightly over 6 figures and I still have never had the chance to breath and because of this fucked up economy and the greed of the ultra rich I can t get promoted fast enough anymore to make enough to save and I ve only been surviving and living paycheck to paycheck And I know this isn t unique but I had set a goal 7 years ago to pay it all off and then start to build a life for myself then I scarified having relationships having friends spending time with family and really any forms of happiness because I just wanted to be free and give myself the chance to LIVE and not just SURVIVE I was so close I was so fucking close to finally getting to a networth of 0 I had fought for my life with not a single dollar of support from anyone and I was counting down the months until I would make that final payment But over the last few months I had begun developing pain in my back and just kept working and fighting through it I d wake up in pain go to sleep in pain but in my mind I just wanted to be free of the debt so kept on pushing myself anyway pain be damned Until 2 weeks ago when the pain had reached a point where I couldn t sit at my desk anymore without feeling a fire in my back and I finally went to the doctor my reluctance from doing it sooner was the fear of more medical bills after I had been working so hard to pay them off Well hindsight is 2020 and maybe things would be different if I stopped fighting but come to find out I have stage 3 lung cancer I ve still been processing it and maybe i ll survive but I ve simply lost the will too 27 years of fighting without reprieve 27 years of trying to see above the water line 27 years of dreaming of someday not being in the noose that is money and 27 years wasted with no friends and most of my family already gone All I wanted to do was help people all I wanted to do was break away from this fucked up game of money I just wanted to feel an ounce of freedom and now my outcomes are simply die or fight more possibly live and restart my nightmare of leaving medical debt as we go into another financial crisis and I still have no financial support or savings I just wanted to feel alive and be able to live an average life and I got neither I ve lost my will to live and my will to keep fighting this world is so fucked up and I can still realize my situation is far from the worst and there are people out there who suffer even more and will continue to because of this horrible fucked up game of money fuck",

eventually agreed because she thought of friend as a son it took months of this women constantly getting abused and I m talking physically abused before she moved out of their house and into our house I should have known there was something wrong with her from the start so after months of them staying in my room me trying to be as polite as possible to her and respect her cause I m not a bad guy I m 18 and new I need to watch what I say even though it was my house and I basically owned it by proxie of my grandma my grandparents owned the house and we re letting my mom rent it my friend was 17 we were supposed to be in school I was the only one actually attending school because his mom didn t know she actually had to put forth effort to re enroll him he was supposed to be enrolling at a school somewhere in another town because that s where they were staying for a while but now that he was staying with us we had to figure out what school he would be going to anyway should have guessed she was a lazy piece of shit by then but one night I knock on the wall to come in I accidentally walked in on her once but quickly walked out apologizing as there is no door and ask if friend or friend s mom were hungry and I asked them to close window friends mom was staying free of charge and already was making like more expensive for my mom which is typical I mean she comes into her house with two kids but I m talking like 200 more in water and electricity I didn t want her running up the bill later I knock again to see if friend was current he wasn t hungry he says yes and I ask her to close the window again she goes from 0 to 100 in 10 seconds like she was on something and the only reason I thought that was because my dad was there and he knows the symptoms of drug abuse his brother did heroine for a short time but stopped she screams at me calling me a child saying I shouldn t be in her room right now please don t judge me but I had been dealing with this woman for quite some time and I ve only been getting rudeness and disrespect from her so I get out and yell back am I a child or a grown man Earlier that day she had told me that I was grown man and I should go unclog the toilet for her when she is a grown woman incapable of unclogging the toilet that she blames my little brother clogged to say the least I told my mom what happened and she told me to take my brothers and go to my dad s house which I did this woman was being extremely aggressive towards me for no reason other than her back was hurting she wanted the cold air to soothe it even though she was putting two different ice hot things on her back and the heat is supposed to help her back but that s besides the point the next day my mom woke up and went to go talk with her and said friend s mom we need to talk friends mom yeah your son is controlling and disrespectful my mom was taken a back but stood firm no this isn t about my son you have a month to find a place to stay my mom said friend s mom oh that won t be necessary we re leaving today my mom tell her that the only reason she was allowed to stay here was that I begged friends mom says well it s his fault we re leaving anyway she then proceeded to take friend s phone and what me and all my friends assume I know not a good thing to do but you have to keep in mind everyone knew friend really well he was an open book and pretended to be him saying I was basically a horrible friend and that we are friends anymore stop contacting me my mom walks in because at this point I was sharing everything that was going on to my mom and the texts because I wasn t going to school that day because of what was going on and says your going to stop being friends with my son because of choice I made What Mom noticed though was that friend s mom had his phone at her feet and he was laying down and was suddenly shocked at this news but didn t want to say anything for fear of making things worse friend has bad anxiety like me and worse social anxiety so his mom in response to this cursed my mom out my mom being very calm took it and just waited for her to leave all the while friend s mom was telling friend you should tell her you should tell her like this was his fight too but he didn t say anything he hung his head low in disapproval of how his mom was acting because she was continuously cursing out my mom and continued to do so even when my dad technically owns the house by proxy of my grandmother as well swings by the crab stuff from my little brother for school he told my mom to stay calm and that she didn t have to take this she could call the cops my mom said thanks but let s not get the cops involved If you made it this far thanks I m sorry to write so much but it was a lot to take in and it s still stressing me out so I figured I needed a way to get it out my mom says I have been overly aggressive lately and I think this would help if anyone knows anything that could help me get rid of

back in with mcdonalds lol and said it was to be safe we live in a gated community and every house on our black has cameras and so does the front of the neiberhood then when she caught me again she paid 2000 dollars to install a new security system so the doors beeped everytime they were opened and said it was because she was scared for her safety",

    "input": "REALITY Aftermath Hi my name is a Yasmeen I am in no contact with both parents I ve been no contact with my dad 3 years and my mom a couple of months so far This journey has been wild lol My dad had sent police cps and even popped up on my patio before he took the next step taking me to court for Grandparent rights My dad was more overt living with him was like walking in eggshells he was typically angry like a dark cloud followed him i lived with him mostly preteen to teen years before that I was a daddies girl My parents were not together and both had a lot of issues i saw them argue a lot growing up and I was always in the middle of them Now that I known what I know now they are both emotionally immature But living with him it was unfair treatment and it was mostly done towards the women he yelled a lot and one time physically harmed me I ve always been disciplined like whoppings growing up in black household I suffered emotional mental and physical abuse Food was used as a tool and my weight Anytime I were to stand up for myself he would try to overpower me to make me feel inferior toward him and people around him enabled this behavior Mind you I m not the only one he s doing this too everyone was catching strays but I mostly took the heat scapegoat It s too much to type to get into detail of events but trust me it was hell Do he took me to court fast forwarding current 2023 I think and because he has a title now sheriff he abused his power to pretty much keep pushing abuse through the court system I saw those statements he had put down and they were white lies it was so triggering to read because I knew he was gaslighting me i wrote a letter to the court and said that he s pretty much not getting any right and I stood on that and explained why iMy therapist had to withdraw from school because it was like reliving the trauma all over again by this time I was in therapy for a good year I think and in school making effort to help myself so went through the whole process for court and they realized that he s pretty much causing trouble and getting in the way and by the statements he made it wasn t a case so I won that because before they got to decide he reneged he ran So I won he has no rights NOW MY MOTHER she is the silent one covert I didn t live with her most of my childhood that s another story for another time I notice now that I m distant from her she played this role was like well I did the best I can THE GOOD COP AND BAD COP DYNAMIC Now 2025 I m pretty much dealing with the aftermath it s difficult and rewarding I have two children myself so I m raising myself and my kids single mom Still trying to break cycles ill be transparent I was raised by an angry man and I became the angry man Thank GOD I ve always been a cry baby lol and I ve always had emotional intelligence I know how to feel my emotions and get through them and sometimes I can dwell on them I didn t realize how bad my nervous system was when something good happened I was irritable and mad because I was waiting on something bad to happen so I m still In therapy i been in my spiritual journey for 4 years and I been using those techniques as well to help me heal and take accountability of my own healing its been helping me to not only face that trauma but to understand it to and why it happened pretty much realizing what s done to me was done to them forgiveness didn t come easily even me having the awareness that it happened to them too my pain from I just and grief because no one listened no one protected me i was rejected and exiled for speaking up for myself so I m still in the path for forgiveness but for myself not for them MIND YOu my mom is still playing mind games and now trying to get my seven year old daughter in the mix by grooming her this is not new BUT im setting boundaries and not arguing over my boundaries its been ALOT of action of my end BUT I hit a breaking point today i notice how first of all I can t control what she does But I don t have to deal with her crap either So I set boundaries but I sit back and watch how she covertly bypasses me and get my daughter involved i have my uncle and aunt not really a big help to pick up kids if they go over her house in some weekends she wants them and if I need or she needs to communicate something which is not every time my daughter has a free cellphone now and my mom been taking advantage of that and one again continue to cross boundaries So I ve been doing my research to see if I could do low contact legally like to have a third party because sometimes family can only do so much but my uncle has been doing a okay job it was one event that made me question them but I don t have to trust them I them I need my them to respect my boundaries and he said okay but because I don t know how long that s going to last I m looking to into that But I notice how I been altering my entire life to manage this meanwhile she continues to play mind games and manipulate but again I don t argue I continue to set boundaries so now Payton s phone she s don t have them on week days now I choose a weekend or have to come up with a schedule Bit because I m aware I have free will I don t have to deal with this just like grandpa took me to court and try to use money to get his way and still lost I m not too worried about grandma either i have options that s what s helping me be grounded but it s also to carry sometimes I have no community outside of my therapist for emotional support but I journal I cry I do all my spiritual techniques to help me ground myself and bring that energy back toward me My kids need me",

experience of my life everything that happens still bothers me to this day When I first got there I was supposed to go to the high school side but instead they put me on the younger kid side and told my mom it was due to safety reason but later I got told that they needed a older role model and someone to help take care and parent the kids in the home I was put under so much pressure and constantly got in trouble for taking care of people I was controlled and constantly got put in isolation over the small things Multiple times when I was in there they withheld my meds and multiple times they threw them on the floor and made me find them like I was a dog and every time I refused I got put in isolation sometimes for days on end When I went in there I was vegetarian and I hadn t touched meat in 5 years but the second I was in there they made me eat meat and any time I complained I would again be put in isolation they put me on food watch and stood over my shoulder while I ate I shit you not the best food there was the moldy bread the food was so bad Every time there was any conflict in the house I would be takin in for questioning and they took my home visits even if I had no association with the conflict because i am supposed to be helping the home and they threatened to send me to the high school side every time there was small issue they would threaten to transfer me multiple times they brought up sending me to wilderness because I was causing issues when I just put my head down The staff would watch me while I showered and while I got changed they would make constant sexual comments about me and my body and multiple times they tried to do things the teacher grabbed my ass and my boobs and when I told my therapist they told me I was over reacting and that I was lying so they took away my home visits and tried to get me into wilderness I was sexually assaulted multiple times in there and every time it was brushed off as if I was the problem Multiple times staf would touch my scars and I have been told by many different staff how to do it better it was super hard on me to hear that all the time Any time I would tell my mom anything I would get in trouble because I shouldn t be telling her things that were going on because it wasn t her business I was in and out of WRA quite a few times and sometimes I still want to go back even tho it was the worst time of my life sometimes I still miss the schedule and the abuse that came from it Going into the real world after WRA was Hard and I didn t gain any real life skills I was isolated in there and had very little control over my life that when I got out I didn t know what to do after my time at west ridge I was in and out of high risks and had multiple suicide attempts I was sent to another treatment program and I am still not the same person I was before treatment going back to school was hard having control of when I went to bed or brushed my teeth or even when I could go to the bathroom was so foreign to me at that point any time I would do anything I was so worried I was going to get in trouble I still sleep on my journal I still have a hard time socializing and I have so

unflattering research 60 Church leaders never apologize for anything even when harmful things done in the past are later disavowed or changed 61 The church has shown in recent years to protect pedophiles and abusers in order to also protect the church s interests 62 The church encourages 8 year old baptisms then later acts like the children were fully informed consensual parties to an
