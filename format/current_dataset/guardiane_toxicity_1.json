gari the script font system for English is Roman script also the Hindi spelling system is not completely standardized This article is yet in English language mostly in order to encourage even non native foreign people who have learnt are learning Hindi to contribute to the Hindi wikipedia and native Hindi speakers who normally write in English The examples given below are only for explanation Recommendations Firstly for proper viewing it is recommended to keep all links NOT UNDERLINED Otherwise the Ã  Ã  Â¾Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¾ below the Hindi alphabets might get partly hidden behind the underlines For this please go to My Preferences Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  ÂªÃ  Ã  Ã  at the top of the page then click Misc and then choose underline links Never Save your settings Also do not click yes for justify paragraphs otherwise on some browsers the devanagari script will appear highly distorted All users are requested and encouraged to contribute articles here especially to create new articles on general topics They are also encouraged to expand the existing articles and improve upon them A non user can also do the same it is recommended but not required to register yourself as a wikipedian user at the Hindi wikipedia As far as possible each article should be written with a Neutral Point of View NPOV Ã¢ no nationalistic or partiality or hatred based articles are welcome The articles should be based on factsÃ¢ and appropriate references should be provided as and where needed See the English wiki s help page for editing in general Almost all the general wiki features are available for editing on Hindi wiki too Guidelines for the content matter is mostly the same as given in English wiki Since the Hindi wiki is at its initial stages users are welcome to take introduction and basic points from the English or another wikipedia s corresponding article and translate them for small articles An in page link to the English wiki s article will be deemed sufficient for references a template might be created stating this For longer articles it is recommended to mention the references separately Since most computer users in India and elsewhere have the standard Western type keyboard it is best recommended but not necessarily required to use the virtual software keyboard like the one of Hindimozhi or of ISIS Tavultesoft Keyman Ã¢ which are freewares These are advantageous because the contemporary Hindi speakers in India often write messages chat using Hindi words but written in Roman English script and the layout of these keyboards is quite the same that such people use For example using the normal keyboard with this software typing ga would give Ã  and ghaa would give Ã  Ã  Â¾ Create the article with its name written in Hindi devanagari script Always take care to include the nukta dot below for foreign Urdu loanwords wherever it occurs in the standard spelling For non Indian names use that spelling for article name and other words which is commonly encountered in Hindi newspapers G K books Hindi dubbed TV documentaries and Hollywood films and magazines e g America Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¾ Ã  Ã  Â¾ Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¾ China Ã  Å¡Ã  Ã  French Ã  Ã  Â¼Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¾Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  For English acronyms short forms use the initials in Roman script and again create a full form in Hindi and redirect it to the short form e g IPA Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¾Ã  Ã  Ã  Å¸Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  ÂµÃ  Ã  Ã  ÂµÃ  Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¾Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  UNO Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¾Ã  Ã  Ã  Å¸Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Doing the opposite is also fine But creating the article with the Hindi short form as Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¾Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  is not recommended Also the article proper must be written with the proper nukta as Ã  Ã  Â¼Ã  Â¾Ã  Ã  Ã  and then a non nukta mis spelt version Ã  Ã  Â¾Ã  Ã  Ã  should preferably be created to redirect to the correct spelling Hindi wikipedia strongly recommends the users to write articles in everyday common Hindi in the Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¼Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Â²Ã  dialect Hindustani or Hindi Urdu i e Ã  Ã  Ã  Â²Ã  Å¡Ã  Â¾Ã  Â² Ã  ÂµÃ  Â¾Ã  Â²Ã  Ã  Â¹Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  which may include many loanwords from Persian and Arabic The use of Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  ÆÃ  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¹Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  is in general neither required nor recommended E g use Ã  ÂµÃ  ÅÃ  Â¹ instead of Ã  Ã  Â¾Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  Â¼Ã  Â¾Ã  instead of Ã  ÂµÃ  Ã  Ã  Ã  Ã  ÂµÃ  Ã  ËÃ

    "input": "A Short History of Republican Sinn FÃ in In 1902 Arthur Griffith Editor of the United Irishman presented to the third annual convention of Cumann na nGaedheal the most revolutionary political idea since the fall of Parnell it was that the elected Irish Members of Parliament should refuse to sit in Westminster demand reinstitution of the Irish Parliament of 1782 and pledge allegiance only to a king of Ireland not to the King of England While the Liberator Daniel OÃ¢ Connell had once considered such unilateral action he had not forced the issue Griffith provided a strategy of passive resistance by turning an assembly of Irish MPs into a de facto constitutional convention Modeled on Frank DeakÃ¢ s policy which resulted in the Dual Monarchy of Austria Hungary in 1867 Griffith serialized his abstentionist program in the United Irishman as the Resurrection of Hungary and then published it as a pamphlet and distributed it widely in 1904 The direct result of this idea was the formation of Sinn FÃ in on 28th November 1905 as an abstentionist political party with internal self reliance as its principal plank pledging never to recognize or use the services or forces of the enemy The founders of Sinn FÃ in were Arthur Griffith SeÃ n T OÃ¢ Kelly Bulmer Hobson Countess Markiewicz and SeÃ n Mac Diarmada In addition to contesting a Parliamentary election in North Lietrim in 1908 Sinn FÃ in was also active locally electing a number of men to county councils and other local bodies Historian lecturer Conradh na Gaeilge president and Radio Free Ã ireann public service broadcasting 99 5 FM in New York commentator Nollaig Ã Gadhra points out that the big change in Sinn FÃ in came in the Ã rd Fheis of 1917 when the Irish Republican Brotherhood IRB under the guidance of Michael Collins and the Irish Volunteers under Cathal Brugha caused Sinn FÃ in to change its policy from monarchist to republican abstention After the Rising Sinn FÃ in adopted an election manifesto for all elections insisting upon the Irish Republic Proclaimed on Easter Monday 1916 Ã amonn deValera campaigning in an Irish Volunteer uniform was elected for East Clare in June 1917 At the Ã rd Fheis of Sinn FÃ in in October 1917 Arthur Griffith graciously stepped down from President to Vice President of Sinn FÃ in to allow the election of deValera who after the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe was the senior surviving Commandant from 1916 This was the Sinn FÃ in which contested the general election of 14 December 1918 promising to NOT represent their constituents or their country in the mighty Westminster Parliament in London but rather to set up without foreign let or hindrance a Republican assembly which would form an Irish government for Ireland Sinn FÃ in won over 79 of the popular vote in all Ireland and 73 of 105 seats in what can only be described as a plebiscite for independence The delegates who assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin formed the First DÃ il Ã ireann and issued the Irish Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 legally the equivalent of the American Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress promulgated on the 4th of July 1776 That Easter Monday 1916 is regarded as the significant date is a consequence of the pre existing Army Council of the Irish Republican Army Ã¢ Ã glaigh na hÃ ireann the IRA insisting upon the First DÃ il Ã ireann recognizing the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916 as a condition for the IRA coming under the authority of the government formed by the First DÃ il Ã ireann See also Dorothy Macardle The Irish Republic New York 1965 The democratic voice of the Irish people had spoken vox populi vox Dei and their elected representatives sought the recognition of their national self determination as promised by American President Woodrow WilsonÃ¢ s Fourteen Points on which basis the Armistice ending the Great War on 11 November 1918 had been accepted by the Central Powers Ireland was denied recognition and a seat at the Versailles peace conference The ensuing conflict between the forces of the Imperial Government in London and the Irish Republic has become known to history as the Ã¢ ÅBlack and Tan WarÃ¢ 1919 1921 But the military lessons of Dublin 1916 having been studied in the internment camp of Frongoch the forces of the Irish Republic waged an asymmetrical conflict against the alien forces of occupation Modern guerilla warfare entered on to the twentieth century England though still in control of many strong points could no longer coerce Ireland into remaining peacefully within her empire A Second Republican DÃ il Ã ireann came together in August 1921 124 Sinn FÃ in and 4 Unionist members Nollaig Ã Gadhra in Civil War in Connacht Cork Dublin Mercier Press 1999 points out that the Sinn FÃ in delegates regarded their mandate to be as Teachta DÃ la Ã ir",

    "input": "Emancipation 1862 was closely tied to growing power of abolitionists as McPherson says By the beginning of 1862 the impetus of war had evolved three shifting and overlapping Republican factions on the slavery question The most dynamic and clearcut faction were the radicals who accepted the abolitionist argument that emancipation could be achieved by exercise of the belligerent power to confiscate enemy property On the other wing of the party a smaller number of conservatives hoped for the ultimate demise of bondage but preferred to see this happen by the voluntary action of slave states coupled with colonization abroad of the freed slaves In the middle were the moderates led by Lincoln who shared the radicals moral aversion to slavery but feared the racial consequences of wholesale emancipation Events during the first half of 1862 pushed moderates toward the radical position One sign of this development was the growing influence of abolitionists Never has there been a time when Abolitionists were as much respected as at present rejoiced one of them in December 1861 End quote from page 494",
