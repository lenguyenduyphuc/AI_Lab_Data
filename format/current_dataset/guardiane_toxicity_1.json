    "input": "I have several points regarding the recent discussion 1 I believe that BruceHallman s statement that the phrase generally assocatied with the United State s princples and interests conforms to WP V WP NPOV AND WP NOR is incorrect First I believe that the Heritage foundation source he uses as pointed out by David Oberst is not being interperted correctly Simply because countries that are rated free by Freedom House are generally more supportive of United States interests does not mean that Freedom House s rating are generally associated with United State s intersts After all the long time US ally Saudi Arabia is treated very harshly by Freedom House The summary of the Heritage foundation report does not accurately reflect the assertions in the report which in fact states the opposite As nations become freer both politically and economically the policies that they consider to be in their interests become more closely aligned with policies championed by the U S not because they are U S policies but because they are policies consistent with the interests of free societies This means that the verification for that statement is not valid In addition even if it were quoted accurately the Heritage Foundations stated goal is to formulate and promote conservative public policies they are not a neutral source Indeed most of the sources for this artical are not neutral sources but are sources with strong bias one way or the other Citing other s opinions while they are verifiable does not make them neutral 2 BruceHallman is correct however in questioning Ultramarine s suggestion that the test of if something is valid is if it reflects how Freedom House describes itself Freedom House itself is not a neutral source and while they may be a good source for some parts of the article such as when they were founded or who the chairman of their board is descriptions of their ideology goals etc should probably be cited as Freedom House s states etc Simply because Freedom House doesn t describe itself a certian way doesn t necessarly mean that it isn t valid 3 Saying that Freedom House is generally associated with US interests isn t necessarly a critisim however it is not a statement of fact either Merely the fact that it has been debated so much on this talk page indicates that it is not a verifiable fact but rather a matter of some contention I will outline how I think the article could be better constructed to include the differing opinions of Freedom House in the next bullet point but I think that the introduction should probably be saved for things that are clearly true and not things that are up for debate 4 I feel that if the article is restructured slightly and the primary editors of this article which lately seem to be BruceHallman and Ultramarine who clearly have different views of Freedom House as an organization could agree on this structure it would save a lot of debate I think the introduction of the article should state basic verifiable facts What they are where they are headquartered where they are located and the fact that they are best known for publishing books A statement saying that their political agenda is a matter of contention might also be included to indicate not everyone things that they are all sunshine and roses I think the next section should be History and Organization and outline when and by whom they were founded it s organization structure the fact that the board is mostly American it s funding and it s membership in other organization I think that the bit about what their activities both in the historical section and in the organization section with the quote should be moved to the next section Activities The Activities though that is maybe a bad heading would include the above statements of what Freedom House s claims of prior activities are the fact that they publish book and details of those books and the information contained in the other activities section The final section I think should be titled something along the lines of Political Leanings Agenda and Controversy or something and would be a space for the differing views of Freedom House to be discussed The validity or lack their of of their ratings if they are bias in favor of an Ameri centric point of view and if they are neo cons or not could be discussed here If the proceding sections are well written they will be limited to things that can be easily verified and all the debate about if Freedom House is good or bad will be contained in this section Calling this section Criticisms has implications that I don t think are necessarly correct",

    "input": "Answer from Falun Gong talk page Katsam Im a Falun Gong practitioner if youd like to listen to what i have to say i can answer your questions briefly from our point of view Many people see Falun Gong in different ways some criticize it and some other people practice it youll hear many things from many people but in the end its up to you to make up your mind about it Falun Gong or Falun Dafa is a cultivation system of mind and body there are the 5 sets of excercises to practice and there are the books for reading which contain the teachings of Mr Li The purpose of our practice is to assimilate to the principles of Truth Benevolence Forbearance and letting go of attatchments all this is substantiated by the practice of the excercises which provides you with gong gradually cleans your body and evolves many things for you A religion can be a cultivation system but not necessarily a cultivation system has to be a religion so Falun Gong is in no way a religion of some sort we dont pray or worship any gods at all and there are no churches or enrollment sistems people practice voluntarily and you can start or stop whenever you want You can practice wherever and whenever you want and as long as you want There are practice sites where you can go if youd like to share your practice and time with other practitioners too There are no ranks in falun gong there is an assistant who teaches the excercises to new people and coordinates the group practice Mr Li is often reffered to as the master by the students because of respect but he never asked to be called this way According to our point of view to be practitioner is to be a person who wants to be better everyday and who wants to improve himself in all the aspects of his life but as you may have noticed not everyone is perfect and we can all make mistakes during the process of cultivation everyone has their own attatchments and personal problems that they have to overcome but with patience i think anything can be achieved so this is why some people feel compelled to practice it more than other types of Qigong About the persecution our point of view on the matter is that there came to be so many falun gong practitioners in China that the government decided to supress them in order to prevent that the Chinese people would start following principles different from the Chinese Comunist ideology Supression or persecution however its called something is happening Some other people may deny it the government might say there is nothing going on but we believe its very clear that there is something going on You can identify the practitioners at the practice sites while they do the excercises or you can just ask true FG practitioners dont lie if they dont want to say something perhaps they wont say it but whatever they say must be true thats the way it should be But i wonder now how can you supress this practice by just telling people not to do it we think there is something beyond that which is torture If you want to legally forbid something you have to have a reason for it so if you dont have it you come up with it Everything i just said is the FG practitioners point of view on the matter and in no way it represents the opinion of everyone present on this talk page perhaps later on you might listen to the critics point of view again all i can say is that its up to you to make up your mind about it If youd like to see some pictures or know more about the practice from the practitioners point of view you can go to this webpage www falundafa com",

    "input": "Why Wikipedia Can t Work Wikipedia claims or is promoted by its users as a replacement for the traditional encyclopedia They frequently compare themselves to the Encyclopaedia Britannica but in reality Wikipedia is not an adequate substitute let alone a replacement What s more because of fundamental problems in Wikipedia s philosophy design and operation it would appear impossible for Wikipedia to ever become such a substitute There are many problems with Wikipedia some more important than others I ll discuss only two that have bitten me in the past The Ignorant Edit Bully Many people have noted this phenomenon though I ve never seen a good name for it before In a nutshell the problem is that a person knowledgable in a given field but not a regular Wikipedia contributor notices an obvious error in a page devoted to a topic in that field They want to be a good citizen so they edit the page and correct the error However within minutes their correction has been reverted restoring the error and if they re particularly unlucky they may receive a note from the person that reverts their change accusing them of page vandalism It seems that there are a large number of Wikipedia devotees or zealots who have little more to do than hang around the Wikipedia site watching for edits to pages that they ve contributed to Any change to their page is taken as a personal insult and instantly reverted regardless of its merit What s worse is that the types of people who do this simply do not have the knowledge or intellectual tools to recognize the merit of the contribution They would appear to typically be young people perhaps in their first couple of years of college They have the headstrong ignorance of the young adult coupled with an insecurity complex that makes them unable to accept that others might have something to contribute that they themselves lack In real life they would be harmless as they wouldn t be able to stand up to others in a confrontation but the anonymity and isolation of the internet give them the confidence to become overly assertive So an expert makes a contribution sees it discarded by someone who obviously has no qualifications to judge it and all the time in the world to get their own way and the expert simply leaves never to contribute to Wikipedia again The quality of many of Wikipedia s articles clearly shows this phenomenon reading through the edit history of many pages shows it in action graphically No Editors Means No Sense of the Valuable Wikipedia prides itself on not relying on professional editors which they claim makes Wikipedia more egalitarian However egalitarianism is not necessarily a desirable quality in a reference work as the philosophy of everyones contributions being equally valuable is simply untrue in the real world As Theodore Sturgeon noted ninety percent of everything is crap This leads to the problem of many of the Wikipedia articles having been created or primarily edited by the edit bullies described above They do not necessarily have a broad knowledge of any of the topics they write about They are generally not well read or broadly educated having little context for the particular areas they have studied in any depth They tend to have concentrated their reading on various things of personal interest to them so they have no sense of proportion or of what is truly significant to the world versus the trivia that was important to them as teenagers and such This results in the Wikipedia in general having laughably large holes in the areas it covers while having an even more ridiculous amount of spurious detail on subjects that it has no need to cover My current favourite example Many Wikipedia articles about important historical figures are little more than caricatures if they have sufficient details to even be called that Many other important figures are simply not mentioned in Wikipedia at all A number of months ago I looked for information on an important North American manufacturing industry figure from the 1980s he could be considered the most important business person of the decade I was somewhat shocked to see that there was no article about him at all Note that I am not identifying him by name this is because Wikipedia tends to react quickly to correct specific faults only when those particular faults are widely publicized in order to render that particular critique null So being a good naive contributor I created the article I noted who he was why he was famous a few of his most important accomplishments and I properly notated the article as being a people related article stub hoping others would help flesh it out A few weeks later I checked back only to find that the article had been c",
