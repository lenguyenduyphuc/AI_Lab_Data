"teenagers","mental_health","anxiety","Any neurodivergent teenager have a review on my hypothesis ","Any neurodivergent teenager have a review on my hypothesis  Tldr : This is a very long thesis on my  theory that the majority of street guys are undiagnosed neurodivergents who wouldn‚Äôt have gone down that path if trauma didn‚Äôt cause they‚Äôre symptoms to manifest in certain ways as it was more socially acceptable I will also explore how someone that used to be so innocent can do ‚Äúevil things ‚Äú n I‚Äôll show how the reason they joined is mostly always the downfall of them aswell what compelled me? I know it all too well I went youth offending for 3 months that same year I was kicked out of 3 schools then I got diagnosed with being neurodivergent in youth offending it‚Äôs ironic how my place of punishment gave me the most support I‚Äôve ever had whereas schools just punished me and pushed me down the pipeline I‚Äôm very lucky to escape and now I'm studying mechanical engineering it's been a thought l've had that this is the most common reason people join gangs / street activities  Long explanation of my theory:   Most street guys either have autism or adhd undiagnosed in which the shaming negligence of theyre emotions invalidation and abuse because of they‚Äôre underlying symptoms of mental health early on causes them to manifest in a different ways due to continuous post trauma causing the symptoms to form in a more socially acceptable way as a defence mechanisms for theyre environment where most undiagnosed neurodivergents end up  ‚Äúthe streets‚Äù not knowing they‚Äôre also now bordelines or suffer from cptsd because the symptoms are so glorified you won‚Äôt even see it as a problem until your in a healthier environment but still  reacting like it‚Äôs still life or death for you and thinking they‚Äôre ‚Äúheart turn cold‚Äù your just numbing yourself so you don‚Äôt have to cope with the emotional side of yourself that may not be suitable for this environment and that‚Äôs why you ‚Äúfeel empty and shallow ‚Äú as you‚Äôve lost your sense of self to protect your physical self with a sprinkle of random dissociation  Most of the trauma starts at home where you wouldn‚Äôt know when your parents would get pissed at you or for what you did and how miniscule it would be and the punishment you would get for that, however you would know they do go 0-100 very quickly things like that in our environment are seen as normal but that‚Äôs because there not aware of mental health symptoms such as emotional dysregulation but when you do things like raise your voice to defend yourself you might be getting hit and then being called a  bad kid that is disrespectful to theyre parents for raising they‚Äôre voice (even if it‚Äôs more out of fear and being anxious than anger ) you‚Äôd take getting shouted at even if it wasn‚Äôt worth the verbal abuse  you got as something being wrong with you in a shameful way such as being a bad kid who doesn‚Äôt respect he‚Äôs parents  This has adverse effects on the kid as he‚Äôs only learnt to communicate he‚Äôs problems aggressively otherwise it would get dismissed which would cause potential unnecessary fights adding to getting in trouble in schools for not focusing in class so he‚Äôs already getting told negative things about himself externally before he gets to find out who he is himself this already sets him up for failure for when he builds he‚Äôs sense of self with almost creating a self fulfilling prophecy  with teachers punishing you rather than giving you support they will give you a detention for getting ‚Äúheavily distracted ,distracting others ‚Äú  on a report card instead of getting help to find out why is this something that‚Äôs happening regardless of consequences especially when you can see the kid making an effort  However if no one is appreciating your effort this will cause you to give up you‚Äôll jus start externalising that Shame into more anger and get into more fights  get put into naughty schools however it maybe   you will start chilling wit the wrong crowd who will also have similar stories to yours in similar environments and upbringing in which you will all influence each other   some of you might be autistic some might be adhd some of you may be comorbid with also ptsd in the form of cptsd or comorbid with bpd but I‚Äôd hazard a guess that most pupils who are regularly kicked out of school are not neurotypical with minimally childhood trauma hence why  You trauma bond and start doing bad things together as there‚Äôs a lot of overlap on alot of the symptoms of these conditions in which you won‚Äôt have to be aware of the symptoms itself to know your similar to someone else that has it such as impulse or thrill seeking for lack of dopamine with adhd or relating to feeling empty after a situation like getting stabbed or being both added onto the fact that the  thrill of doing something wrong and getting away with it such as stealing cars robbing shops  ( that Is because you finally doing something naughty by your own choice and the risk of getting caught was the thrill some of these things some wouldn‚Äôt have dared done before a certain age but they are trying to feel connected to a world they learnt to numb due to a neglect of their needs and emotions) however this would be the classed as the ‚ÄúHoneymoon phase‚Äù of a group forming where people would  build a new persona in which stuff like being a ‚Äúhothead‚Äù is glorified but having a ‚Äúfreeze or flight ‚Äú reaction to the same situation is stigmatised in which these kids don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs just they‚Äôre symptoms of mental health manifesting in a different way as a defence mechanism for survival  however whenever it‚Äôs guys with similar symptoms of each other because of similar situations and lack of support certain traits are more desirable than others such as your capacity for violence over good inter personal skills as through confirmation bias of situations one has come in more handy than the other  therefore when a malleable kid who‚Äôs attempt of interpersonal skills got him neglected and exploited whereas the more violent he would learn to be the more respect he got in an environment he felt like finally related too  he wouldn‚Äôt care which one is ‚Äúright ‚Äú or ‚Äúwrong ‚Äú by the societal standards / structure that was the same structure that kept labelling him bad and told him who he was as a person instead of why he was that person and instead of support  punished him for symptoms he was tryna control n still got neglected for it regardless of the effort  embracing those symptoms around similar people who have had the same unique experiences as you feels liberating and new ."

It was more of a friendship with affectionate gifts  Either way she didn't think of me more as a friend and told me cold-heartedly that we should just be friends but she didn't decide to do it when I was out of this madness, no she did it 2,5 weeks before I am planned to move out wich got me into some bad thinking so I didn't shower until today wich is almost 2 weeks since she texted me Now I'm mostly OK because I shaked it off and took some drinks and tomorrow I'm going to the bar with a friend and a girl I don't know that well except her name and that she is very introverted and looks like an emo but I'm not really sure if she is into that stuff (emos are cool) But yeah, I wish that girl hadn't said anything until I moved out because it felt really nice to have someone that I could talk to about stuff in my life that I didn't feel like telling anyone else  Now I have no one so I bottle it all and tbh its a lot, every day in my life is so fkn challenging so after 2-3 days I'm so drained I can't even get out of bed and when I used to text her she didn't really read it all she just scrolled through it and if I brought something up from earlier when I talked to her irl she would just say something like "" I think u texted me about that"" and yeah it just felt like someone was there if I completely lost it  Now I just feel like a damn robot or something, I can't really remember what day it is so I gotta check the date a lot, I also don't remember most days since she told me that thing, everything just flied past and I felt really shitty I hope tho that now I'm able to get back up fully and find another way to get through my days, even tho I'm still friends with this girl I don't hold as much trust as I used to  Well that was it I guess."

I didn't bring my phone because I planned on returning that evening, I went out and immediately as I went past other people I started feeling this kind of choking feeling, started having sweaty palms and getting a general feeling of uneasiness, I walked in a manner where I was 100% focused on my posture, the way I walked and where I looked, I did this to try and minimize looking like a weirdo, altho come to think of it this might have had a counter effect."

then 6 months old brother when I just went to use the bathroom, I took her to a doctor the next day and we have been on this journey ever since and it just seems to be getting worse especially this year, she has been to so many different doctors and therapists and different meds and nothing seems to be helping, this last year has completely broken me both both mentally and physically, a year ago

amount of weight due to stress and working nonstop while trying to figure out a way to help her, I feel like I have checked out of life and that I would rather die then spend one more day in this

year without getting kicked out, I have had to work graveyard hours to be home during the day and be able to get her to doctor appointment and counseling and whatever else that needs to be done but

Report them ""What if it was my favorite teacher?"" Report them ""What if it ruins their prospects of-"" Report them ""What if I'm a guy?""

Report them ""What if I feel like it was my fault, or I did something wrong, or I'd get in trouble for being involved?"" Report them It wasn't your fault, and you wouldn't be overreacting.

And even though I've trained myself to be happy on my own and enjoy my own company as being alone and feeling lonely are 2 different things, I still wish I had a best friend also girlfriend (same person) from the opposite gender without seeming like I'm asking for much or begging to spend activities or just check up on me regularly, I have wrote suicide notes before so it would be nice to have someone other than my family care more and ask how my day went or just motivate me as I moved away from work purposes and get very frustrated and stressed at work and barely have any time to think about anything, it's not asking for much but I've been way too much on social media lately that I just don't fit any of these new girls preferences and I'm the average untractive guy, working a small paying IT Job for the passion."

I know it all too well I went youth offending for 3 months that same year I was kicked out of 3 schools then I got diagnosed with being neurodivergent in youth offending it‚Äôs ironic how my place of punishment gave me the most support I‚Äôve ever had whereas schools just punished me and pushed me down the pipeline I‚Äôm very lucky to escape and now I'm studying mechanical engineering it's been a thought l've had that this is the most common reason people join gangs / street activities  Long explanation of my theory:   Most street guys either have autism or adhd undiagnosed in which the shaming negligence of theyre emotions invalidation and abuse because of they‚Äôre underlying symptoms of mental health early on causes them to manifest in a different ways due to continuous post trauma causing the symptoms to form in a more socially acceptable way as a defence mechanisms for theyre environment where most undiagnosed neurodivergents end up  ‚Äúthe streets‚Äù not knowing they‚Äôre also now bordelines or suffer from cptsd because the symptoms are so glorified you won‚Äôt even see it as a problem until your in a healthier environment but still  reacting like it‚Äôs still life or death for you and thinking they‚Äôre ‚Äúheart turn cold‚Äù your just numbing yourself so you don‚Äôt have to cope with the emotional side of yourself that may not be suitable for this environment and that‚Äôs why you ‚Äúfeel empty and shallow ‚Äú as you‚Äôve lost your sense of self to protect your physical self with a sprinkle of random dissociation  Most of the trauma starts at home where you wouldn‚Äôt know when your parents would get pissed at you or for what you did and how miniscule it would be and the punishment you would get for that, however you would know they do go 0-100 very quickly things like that in our environment are seen as normal but that‚Äôs because there not aware of mental health symptoms such as emotional dysregulation but when you do things like raise your voice to defend yourself you might be getting hit and then being called a  bad kid that is disrespectful to theyre parents for raising they‚Äôre voice (even if it‚Äôs more out of fear and being anxious than anger ) you‚Äôd take getting shouted at even if it wasn‚Äôt worth the verbal abuse  you got as something being wrong with you in a shameful way such as being a bad kid who doesn‚Äôt respect he‚Äôs parents  This has adverse effects on the kid as he‚Äôs only learnt to communicate he‚Äôs problems aggressively otherwise it would get dismissed which would cause potential unnecessary fights adding to getting in trouble in schools for not focusing in class so he‚Äôs already getting told negative things about himself externally before he gets to find out who he is himself this already sets him up for failure for when he builds he‚Äôs sense of self with almost creating a self fulfilling prophecy  with teachers punishing you rather than giving you support they will give you a detention for getting ‚Äúheavily distracted ,distracting others ‚Äú  on a report card instead of getting help to find out why is this something that‚Äôs happening regardless of consequences especially when you can see the kid making an effort  However if no one is appreciating your effort this will cause you to give up you‚Äôll jus start externalising that Shame into more anger and get into more fights  get put into naughty schools however it maybe   you will start chilling wit the wrong crowd who will also have similar stories to yours in similar environments and upbringing in which you will all influence each other   some of you might be autistic some might be adhd some of you may be comorbid with also ptsd in the form of cptsd or comorbid with bpd but I‚Äôd hazard a guess that most pupils who are regularly kicked out of school are not neurotypical with minimally childhood trauma hence why  You trauma bond and start doing bad things together as there‚Äôs a lot of overlap on alot of the symptoms of these conditions in which you won‚Äôt have to be aware of the symptoms itself to know your similar to someone else that has it such as impulse or thrill seeking for lack of dopamine with adhd or relating to feeling empty after a situation like getting stabbed or being both added onto the fact that the  thrill of doing something wrong and getting away with it such as stealing cars robbing shops  ( that Is because you finally doing something naughty by your own choice and the risk of getting caught was the thrill some of these things some wouldn‚Äôt have dared done before a certain age but they are trying to feel connected to a world they learnt to numb due to a neglect of their needs and emotions) however this would be the classed as the ‚ÄúHoneymoon phase‚Äù of a group forming where people would  build a new persona in which stuff like being a ‚Äúhothead‚Äù is glorified but having a ‚Äúfreeze or flight ‚Äú reaction to the same situation is stigmatised in which these kids don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs just they‚Äôre symptoms of mental health manifesting in a different way as a defence mechanism for survival  however whenever it‚Äôs guys with similar symptoms of each other because of similar situations and lack of support certain traits are more desirable than others such as your capacity for violence over good inter personal skills as through confirmation bias of situations one has come in more handy than the other  therefore when a malleable kid who‚Äôs attempt of interpersonal skills got him neglected and exploited whereas the more violent he would learn to be the more respect he got in an environment he felt like finally related too  he wouldn‚Äôt care which one is ‚Äúright ‚Äú or ‚Äúwrong ‚Äú by the societal standards / structure that was the same structure that kept labelling him bad and told him who he was as a person instead of why he was that person and instead of support  punished him for symptoms he was tryna control n still got neglected for it regardless of the effort  embracing those symptoms around similar people who have had the same unique experiences as you feels liberating and new ."

"depression","mental_health","depression","My life story","Cloak and dagger really,go behind my back spreading shit lies etc so on making many people dislike me and successful in doing so and even when he basically stepped back from doing all that people for years continued doing it,my 1st childhood crush he convinced to hate me and generally just isolated me,and i want to make clear now that this school was very small so literally everyone knew the shit he was spitting which to this day i know no details of really but it still had a massive impact on me Around this era of my life i started to get into social media,insta kik skype (yea remember those,well insta is still infact more relevant now) even the very early days of amino back when it was all individual apps,i tried making friends on pokemon amino back in the day but i lacked very little success  Partiually due to toxic people on there,another part into how socially inept i was and a heavy majority around to my emotionally instability which has prosisted as a problem for serveal years and worsened in many ways,the only positive i can really say is i‚Äôm somewhat more self aware and can hold some self control at times but weirdly my ability to hold things in more only makes my blowups when they do happen much worse You think being introduced to social media would a net positive for these feelings of loneliness right but it was the complete opposite it only amplified them dramatically seeing how everyone else got along with people and i didn‚Äôt,getting into secondary school was already bad enough as people meeting up outside was becoming more and more of a common thing naturally with people getting to that age but i was never exposed to such opportunities Here i was still dreaming about getting a full coach of people to play some new super mario bros wii and mario kart and that never really happened,as me being introduced to xbox live in the late 360 days i think that eventually transitioned into having a gaming group online by the xbone days but that is another dream i had tempering issues with So where are we now anyways I‚Äôm kinda getting lost in all these sidetracks,my slow decend further and further into depression? But now let‚Äôs go into the ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù which i referred to it as at the time but looking back that was really delusional of me This is when i finally built a gaming group of sorts,you had your gaming swed wolver that i almost saw as a little brother or sorts,knight which i saw as the every man as my equel as someone i could even convide in somewhat with my mental struggles,and zombies the narristic ego maniac who admitely brought stuff to the table that none of us had knowledge of really You make ask what happened with these 3,well after the 2 years of ‚Äúsolid‚Äù friendship things started going on and off constantly,zombies eventually started getting pissy with me and ended up blocking all of us,knight got a girlfriend and changed into a completely different person and as for wolver well he refused to basically play anything that wasn‚Äôt cod zombies or forza But around this time i also had a friend that had nothing to do with gaming she became my emotion clutch of sorts named kimchi‚Ä¶i loved this girl but given everything that had happened in my life at that point but struggling to come to terms with it all,my unsettling home life,crippingly loneliness,my emotions,the bullying‚Ä¶alot of this shit i just didn‚Äôt understand at the time but it made me sad depressed and stressed all the same so i‚Äôd express how i‚Äôm feeling but no matter what she really said given she couldn‚Äôt comfort or resolve me on said issues things naturally got worse I can barely look back at the messages i sent her i even stop and think if i had really sent them‚Ä¶they just all look awful and i genuinely don‚Äôt forgive myself for what said especially for how much she meant and probably still does to me When she inevitably left and understandably happened around the same time or well rather after the group fell apart so i was left with nothing I ended up joining another support amino where i would meet significant people 2 named beth and jess,beth was a bitch and jess was probably the person i shouldve talked to more and given more attention to given we wrre in the same boat but given how i was at the time they basically just demonised me‚Ä¶despite having regret for the stuff i was doing cause i did and even wanting to adjust that shit i was just shit out and branded as a monster Not even a whole ‚Äúyou need help‚Äù just that i was a lost cause and not worth saving when i myself was suffering at the time‚Ä¶but this is also around the time i met a friend called blue who would go on to be my best friend for many years but even we would have a shakey relationship over the years Other than the diffculty with the afformention 2 people i also had this person acusing me of being over 20 due to my looks‚Ä¶i was 15-16 at the time maybe even 14 all this blurs together but having them acuse me of lying about my age and etc definitely had a major impact on me which brings me back to my kik days once more briefly I remember having my face as my pfp on there back in the day but even from the age of 12 i had subble on my chin so looking back at the time to some i probably looked like i was in my late teens but people would often make fun and insult me for my appearance and at a very early age just gave me the impression of being ugly which i still have to this day,its a simliar reason why i dont like sharing or showing my face online because so often i‚Äôve been treated differently after the fact like this person refusing to talk to me This created a whole other drama that eventually forced me to be removed from a community i felt welcomed by once again and even caused a rift between me and a friend at the time that i deeply regret‚Ä¶you see she was the leader at the time anf fairly or not defended me to the death‚Ä¶but it came to a point where she got overruled and did what had to be done At the time i sorta felt betrayed and she stood by it,wether she actually did or not or wether it was even right or not i cant say to this day‚Ä¶the only regret i do have which i imagine she related with was that we let that get in the way of our friendship ultimately ending that‚Ä¶of all the people i would like to apologise to she was one of them but unfortunately haven‚Äôt managed to reach them to do so Coming back to the real world again i finally got out of that horrible school but it was a situation of out of the pan and into the fire as the collage i went too was argueably worse Harrassment of teachers and students and no one really wanting to take any accountability,lessons were either piss easy or too difficult and was getting no help in those instances call it goldielocks but it was true Then Covid happened which you think would make things worse but ironically it probably did me more good in a way because i was living covid my whole life locked in doors on my one with no one to talk to or anywhere to go‚Ä¶for once people were sorta in my shoes,not that i‚Äôm glad any of that shit happened god no‚Ä¶and i wouldn‚Äôt say there was any real long term benefits to it for me either but yea Second year of collage comes around and i get to a point i cant take it anymore and refuse to come back,then social services come into the scene and why i am only mentioning these pricks now seizes to amaze me‚Ä¶being on the spectrum i‚Äôve had these guys ‚Äúhelping‚Äù me for years but in reality they take 2-3 business years to do as minimum as possible,they convinced me to deroll from collage with the promise they would get me elsewhere‚Ä¶which guess what that never happend And here i am now 3-4 years later without getting back into any sort of education or work and my mental health only got worse from there,i finally got a place of ‚Äúmy‚Äù own which wasn‚Äôt really mind it was just an empty place my dad got cause reasons and after bs at home i moved into there and never looked back And i had been through many friendships online mostly short term some few long term ones me and blue went seperate ways once which broke me but we eventually got back on talking terms over a year or 2 later after i felt i had improved‚Ä¶i had not which resulted in a far worse breakdown 2 years later that sent me into a horrible spiral that sorta brings me to now She left me 17th of December 2023 a date that rings in my mind to this day‚Ä¶and for about 6-7 months i desperately tried to geg her back looking at everything i did wrong and everything i could of done and do differently and i took online therapy and everything i had every genuine effort of making things right but for better or worse she had replaced me Around march i joined a suicide forum more learning towards ending my life at that point as her return seemed less and less likely and with everything else going the way it was,no education no job,no friends,no real family outside of the core,you could see why i was leading down this natural path And i got closer and closer to thag eventually meant some people along the way one kf which would be a bitch that maniplated the whole site and made me out to be this monster i never was which got me outsted from there too‚Ä¶feeling a common tread here i‚Äôm aware But around june things did change for me and not just because of the start of the euros but a person i met that went on to be my partner‚Ä¶but simliar story given the amount of trauma i had dealt with in the past 6-7 months yet alone serveal years i felt myself having to fill my life and sole with postives and good people Given i was surrounded for ages wirh people that hated and despised me surrounding myself wkrh people that liked and loved me were only natural unfortunately in achieving this there were far to many setbacks even alot of which let in more undesirable people i had to recover from making an endless cycle Also during this stage of recovery i tried to get back on this group i was on previously to see my friend irl again which is another story i didn‚Äôt explain for a few years i was on this grouo where i basically didn‚Äôt jeal with anyone despite being told i eventually would i never did even some of the staff were toxic toward me the only people i had positive relationships with were well the people i already knew and had a positive relationship with but when me and my buddy fell out i saw no reason to go anymore and withdrew from the service that i‚Äôve almost since spent a year trying to get back onto I also wanna clarify up to 17 my only real interest was gaming i always loved music but never came into tune with it later,tried anime and loved it got into football with the 2018 world cup and so on‚Ä¶i only really diversified later on especially given my shutin anit social despite being an extrovert (or least ambriovert) life style The gaming group i once again tried to stich together that i was holding together by a thread crumbed and collapsed apart and on top of that the what was my parent and best friend basically wanted nothing to do with me either so it basically left me back where i was back where i am now Still traumatised by the lose of that friend coming up to 2 years ago,more isolated than i‚Äôve ever been,academically behind where i should be,socially awkward and inadept,emotionally unstable and volatile  I don‚Äôt really have a place in this world anymore‚Ä¶or so it feels and i hope by writing my story you can somewhat see why"

After that i decided to try weed, one of the worst decisions i could have done, as you can imagine it started as a ‚Äútry‚Äù, then it went to every weekend, suddenly everyday, until about 3 weeks ago where i put a stop to weed, to bad companies that also smoked and fought for little things, and also the sun was finally starting in Portugal, so i started going to the beach a lot, really helped me honestly as i felt a weird  happiness that i was chasing for a long time, until 3 days ago as i slept my mom got into my phone and discovered i was smoking, as you can imagine the hell she has been giving me on the last few days, I‚Äôve heard it all, in few words, she said if i did it to try and get her attention i can just kill myself because its way easier, including other things that i felt almost like a stab, and i don‚Äôt blame her,she always gave me the best life she could and i never did anything wrong, not even vapes i would touch in Mexico snd since i came here, my behavior, the way i dress, the fights, everything is changing and its not how it was supposed to be or how i want to be, its what my environment made me, and when i really felt i was gonna get better by myself by changing up people i was with and stop smoking and i was feeling better, she founds out, and starts treating me as if I was still smoking no matter how many times i say im not and the worst is i was literally already stopping, in about a month and something im visiting my friends and girlfriend in Mexico and ever since i heard this my whole life is that, i don‚Äôt feel like caring for anything else and the thing is i am very confused on what are ‚Äúsuicidal thoughts‚Äù but for example, it has crossed my mind more than once, i also couldn‚Äôt see me living here for example until next year or until im 18, I couldn‚Äôt see it in the sense if my life goes the same as now i would probably commit suicide, and i really don‚Äôt say it proudly i just don‚Äôt understand how coming to this country made me go from a innocent kid to what i am now, and I cant stress enough how many times i told my mom this country had the problems it has and she just told me its part of it, i don‚Äôt know what my life will be after this visit to Mexico and i am scared if it goes the same way i might just fall into a deeper cycle any advice given, any help i will take, please."

I was very skinny, and was growing a long hair (I'm unnaware of the explanation for such a feeling but I just felt slightly better with my hair partially covering my face because I hated my looks and I hated to look myself mirror, and I still do to this day), and I went through all sorts of humiliation possible, the competitions chat on YouTube was filled with insults and people making fun of me, was the first time in 4 years they added moderators to the chat to filter some comments, I was going through my first breakup, anxiety attacks, and all I had was my mother I was 17, sleeping in my mothers bed because I'd sleep and wake up crying and shaking desperately, I had no control of my body and I all I could do was cry every single day non stop It was a teams comp, and I single handedly beat the other team, our team was a complete rookie team, all the 4 players never had played an official competition before, so we were the underdogs, that made me very happy so I went to look at the chat comments and that destroyed me, no one was talking about how good I played, no one was talking about the game, all it had was comments filled with sadistic jokes about how I looked, I was called a transgender, some Spanish comments spamming ayuwoki (Idk how to write it) or something to make fun of my looks, lesbian middle school teacher, my social media was filled with insults and hate, back then you could dm anyone on twitter and I was very active there so you can guess what I'd read every single day, and that was killing me inside."

I know it all too well I went youth offending for 3 months that same year I was kicked out of 3 schools then I got diagnosed with being neurodivergent in youth offending it‚Äôs ironic how my place of punishment gave me the most support I‚Äôve ever had whereas schools just punished me and pushed me down the pipeline I‚Äôm very lucky to escape and now I'm studying mechanical engineering it's been a thought l've had that this is the most common reason people join gangs / street activities  Long explanation of my theory:   Most street guys either have autism or adhd undiagnosed in which the shaming negligence of theyre emotions invalidation and abuse because of they‚Äôre underlying symptoms of mental health early on causes them to manifest in a different ways due to continuous post trauma causing the symptoms to form in a more socially acceptable way as a defence mechanisms for theyre environment where most undiagnosed neurodivergents end up  ‚Äúthe streets‚Äù not knowing they‚Äôre also now bordelines or suffer from cptsd because the symptoms are so glorified you won‚Äôt even see it as a problem until your in a healthier environment but still  reacting like it‚Äôs still life or death for you and thinking they‚Äôre ‚Äúheart turn cold‚Äù your just numbing yourself so you don‚Äôt have to cope with the emotional side of yourself that may not be suitable for this environment and that‚Äôs why you ‚Äúfeel empty and shallow ‚Äú as you‚Äôve lost your sense of self to protect your physical self with a sprinkle of random dissociation  Most of the trauma starts at home where you wouldn‚Äôt know when your parents would get pissed at you or for what you did and how miniscule it would be and the punishment you would get for that, however you would know they do go 0-100 very quickly things like that in our environment are seen as normal but that‚Äôs because there not aware of mental health symptoms such as emotional dysregulation but when you do things like raise your voice to defend yourself you might be getting hit and then being called a  bad kid that is disrespectful to theyre parents for raising they‚Äôre voice (even if it‚Äôs more out of fear and being anxious than anger ) you‚Äôd take getting shouted at even if it wasn‚Äôt worth the verbal abuse  you got as something being wrong with you in a shameful way such as being a bad kid who doesn‚Äôt respect he‚Äôs parents  This has adverse effects on the kid as he‚Äôs only learnt to communicate he‚Äôs problems aggressively otherwise it would get dismissed which would cause potential unnecessary fights adding to getting in trouble in schools for not focusing in class so he‚Äôs already getting told negative things about himself externally before he gets to find out who he is himself this already sets him up for failure for when he builds he‚Äôs sense of self with almost creating a self fulfilling prophecy  with teachers punishing you rather than giving you support they will give you a detention for getting ‚Äúheavily distracted ,distracting others ‚Äú  on a report card instead of getting help to find out why is this something that‚Äôs happening regardless of consequences especially when you can see the kid making an effort  However if no one is appreciating your effort this will cause you to give up you‚Äôll jus start externalising that Shame into more anger and get into more fights  get put into naughty schools however it maybe   you will start chilling wit the wrong crowd who will also have similar stories to yours in similar environments and upbringing in which you will all influence each other   some of you might be autistic some might be adhd some of you may be comorbid with also ptsd in the form of cptsd or comorbid with bpd but I‚Äôd hazard a guess that most pupils who are regularly kicked out of school are not neurotypical with minimally childhood trauma hence why  You trauma bond and start doing bad things together as there‚Äôs a lot of overlap on alot of the symptoms of these conditions in which you won‚Äôt have to be aware of the symptoms itself to know your similar to someone else that has it such as impulse or thrill seeking for lack of dopamine with adhd or relating to feeling empty after a situation like getting stabbed or being both added onto the fact that the  thrill of doing something wrong and getting away with it such as stealing cars robbing shops  ( that Is because you finally doing something naughty by your own choice and the risk of getting caught was the thrill some of these things some wouldn‚Äôt have dared done before a certain age but they are trying to feel connected to a world they learnt to numb due to a neglect of their needs and emotions) however this would be the classed as the ‚ÄúHoneymoon phase‚Äù of a group forming where people would  build a new persona in which stuff like being a ‚Äúhothead‚Äù is glorified but having a ‚Äúfreeze or flight ‚Äú reaction to the same situation is stigmatised in which these kids don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs just they‚Äôre symptoms of mental health manifesting in a different way as a defence mechanism for survival  however whenever it‚Äôs guys with similar symptoms of each other because of similar situations and lack of support certain traits are more desirable than others such as your capacity for violence over good inter personal skills as through confirmation bias of situations one has come in more handy than the other  therefore when a malleable kid who‚Äôs attempt of interpersonal skills got him neglected and exploited whereas the more violent he would learn to be the more respect he got in an environment he felt like finally related too  he wouldn‚Äôt care which one is ‚Äúright ‚Äú or ‚Äúwrong ‚Äú by the societal standards / structure that was the same structure that kept labelling him bad and told him who he was as a person instead of why he was that person and instead of support  punished him for symptoms he was tryna control n still got neglected for it regardless of the effort  embracing those symptoms around similar people who have had the same unique experiences as you feels liberating and new ."

moving on to my sophomore year I meet this really nice guy who was a freshman but as I mentioned before I skipped a year so we where the same age, we hit it off great and we started to become close friends and not long after we started dating, I was his first girlfriend and my previous experience with my ex wasn‚Äôt so great so we had no clue what we were supposed to do, we take things slow and still acted as friends most of the times but we got more physical with a couple kisses here and there but it was great and I felt like I was the queen of the world, my grades improved a lot, my GPA went up a lot too and my home life improved too, everything was great but he had no clue about who I was before we meet, I was terrified and I thought he would totally break up after he found out but all he did was listen and hug me while I was sobbing and beating myself up about how terrible I was and how much of a piece of shit I am but he said that it‚Äôs all in the past now and that no matter how broken I was he would be there to help me heal and he would never see me any different because he meet the new me and that‚Äôs who he fell for not the old me, he has been a great help and we have been dating for 2 years now, he‚Äôs been there for me when I had my anxiety attacks, when I was having mental breakdowns he held me in his arms and told me it‚Äôs okay to cry and I wasn‚Äôt weak, he has been there for me when I called him at 3 in the morning crying because I don‚Äôt want to live anymore and told me that everything will be okay and we‚Äôll get through it and that he‚Äôll get up as many times as he has to to listen to me because I matter to him and my life matters and he sees potential in me, that I can make a difference in this world and that to him in the most precious thing and he‚Äôll never give up -Moving on to my junior year there wasn‚Äôt much going on I felt happy and I made a lot of improvements and accomplished many things, I was getting back into sports again and gained the libero position on the high school team, I was also on of the team captains in my robotics team( my boyfriend was part of it too), I got a job and even got back into doing MMA and making many new friends and learning new skills, this was the happiest I ever felt and I didn‚Äôt cene suffer a single anxiety attack that year and all thanks to the support of my boyfriend and the new found self confidence and love he has been helping me build, summer comes around and this is when Covid was happening, we went on some dates but mainly going to each other‚Äôs places and hangout with family, it was great I feel genuinely loved and it‚Äôs the first time I told myself that maybe and just maybe this is what love is actually like, childish I know but let me dream okay people I‚Äôm only 15 anyways lol!
